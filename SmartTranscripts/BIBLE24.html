        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="12.0"> We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Jeremiah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="18.0" data-end="22.0"> You remember how yesterday we were looking at the book of Isaiah, and you kind of come away feeling like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="22.0" data-end="28.0"> alright, there's some pretty stiff judgment in there, but the balance of it is hope</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.0" data-end="32.0"> and optimism that goes far beyond the circumstances that are immediately in view.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.0" data-end="34.0"> You remember that, right? It's kind of fun, hopeful.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="34.0" data-end="39.0"> Today we're talking about Jeremiah, and just invert all of that ratio.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="39.0" data-end="47.0"> Here there's a glimmer of hope, but more so what we're going to see is a whole lot of judgment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="47.0" data-end="52.0"> We're going to see one guy, Jeremiah, well, and his helper is scribe Baruch,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="52.0" data-end="55.0"> who supports him and chronicles all of this stuff,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="55.0" data-end="62.0"> pushing back against this tidal wave of foolishness and immorality</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="62.0" data-end="66.0"> and hostility from the people of Judah toward their God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="66.0" data-end="73.0"> You got one guy who is pleading with them not to continue on the course they're continuing on,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="73.0" data-end="75.0"> but when it becomes clear that that's what they're going to do,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="75.0" data-end="79.0"> this one guy is also bold enough to proclaim on behalf of God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="79.0" data-end="82.0"> There is judgment coming, and it is going to hurt a lot.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="82.0" data-end="88.0"> So Jeremiah is riding toward the very end in the closing years of the Kingdom of Judah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="88.0" data-end="92.0"> That's the southern kingdom, the one that outlasted the northern kingdom,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="92.0" data-end="94.0"> which you'll recall got defeated by Assyria,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="94.0" data-end="99.0"> but during the lifetime of Jeremiah, Assyria fades into the background</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.0" data-end="102.0"> and a new threat arises. This is Babylon.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="102.0" data-end="108.0"> While Babylon might not have been quite as vile as the Assyrians, they're bigger,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.0" data-end="113.0"> they're more powerful, and they are just as bent on conquest.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.0" data-end="115.0"> Some of the prophets we read about in the Old Testament,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.0" data-end="119.0"> we get a pretty good accounting of what the terms of their being called</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.0" data-end="120.0"> to be a prophet were all about.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="120.0" data-end="123.0"> Others all we get is they were a prophet, and then they got to work,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.0" data-end="125.0"> and here's what they had to say.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.0" data-end="129.0"> With Jeremiah, we get a pretty decent amount of biographical material,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.0" data-end="134.0"> and the book of Jeremiah looks like it's a compilation of a whole lot of different styles of literature,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="134.0" data-end="139.0"> of different things that Jeremiah wrote himself about his own life,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="139.0" data-end="142.0"> and recordings of Jeremiah's prophecies,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="142.0" data-end="146.0"> but it also looks like parts of Jeremiah were maybe written by,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="146.0" data-end="150.0"> or at least compiled by this Baruch character who helped him out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="150.0" data-end="155.0"> There's some pretty high drama and a lot of accounting of the persecution</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.0" data-end="159.0"> and difficulties Jeremiah goes through as he's continually there</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="159.0" data-end="163.0"> as a burr under the saddle of the kings he speaks to,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.0" data-end="166.0"> and the culture he's speaking to,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="166.0" data-end="170.0"> nobody really likes what he has to say because it is so withering</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="170.0" data-end="173.0"> and so loaded with a terrifying judgment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="173.0" data-end="178.0"> It's one of those deals where when things go off the rails as badly as they've gone</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="178.0" data-end="182.0"> in Jeremiah's context, and he says the thing that is true,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="190.0" data-end="195.0"> that it takes a very exceptional person to admit it and repent</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="195.0" data-end="199.0"> and acknowledge that this truth teller is actually telling the truth</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="206.0" data-end="210.0"> you generally have this period right before then where everybody is in denial</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="225.0" data-end="227.0"> it was just a matter of time until that actually played out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="227.0" data-end="232.0"> So that is the moment in the lifestyle of a kingdom, a people group, a culture</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="232.0" data-end="236.0"> that Jeremiah's writing into that he's speaking into,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="239.0" data-end="242.0"> And so in the early going here, the most basic message of Jeremiah</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="242.0" data-end="247.0"> is there was a covenant between you, God's chosen people and God,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="247.0" data-end="249.0"> and you have not held up your end of the bargain,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="249.0" data-end="253.0"> and God is now going to hold up his end of that conditional bargain,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="253.0" data-end="256.0"> which means you are going to receive judgment and it's going to hurt.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="256.0" data-end="260.0"> And chief among the examples that Jeremiah points to</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="260.0" data-end="264.0"> is the fact that God's chosen people are cheating on him,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="264.0" data-end="268.0"> they go and worship in this beautiful temple that Solomon made</p>
