        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.24" data-end="8.72"> and shut things down yesterday because I was like, no, I don't want to be rushed. I want to</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.72" data-end="15.68"> talk about all of these points in the book of Matthew where that theme about Jesus affirming</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="20.8" data-end="25.76"> This is a cool rounding out, it's such a cool payoff. And so, yeah, as I am in the habit of doing</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.76" data-end="32.24"> from time to time, I split the thing in half. I think we were in like chapter 11 or chapter 12</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.24" data-end="37.44"> looking at examples of this theme. I don't know, we're just going to pick up wherever I cut us off</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="44.56" data-end="46.160000000000004"> then we'll just pick it up from there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="46.16" data-end="60.16"> Then how about chapters 11 and 12 when John the Baptist disciples show up and everybody's like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="60.16" data-end="64.32"> yeah, John the Baptist, he's an idiot, but Jesus fires back at the crowd. And he's like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="64.32" data-end="68.32"> whoa, I tell you the truth, among those born of women, there's not been anyone greater than John</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="73.76" data-end="81.36"> at that theme, that idea that proximity to Jesus is the most valuable thing. And John the Baptist,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="81.36" data-end="86.72"> like he was prophesied in the Old Testament. He had the job of pointing people to Jesus. That's</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="93.52000000000001" data-end="100.64"> is of greatest value. How about Matthew 12 versus one through eight when the disciples,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="100.64" data-end="103.84"> or you remember they're going through the grain field and they're picking it and it's on a Sabbath</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="106.96000000000001" data-end="112.56"> Sabbath. And then Jesus gives them that example about David and he goes into the house of God and</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="112.56" data-end="117.52"> he isn't in his companions. They ate the consecrated bread, which wasn't lawful for them to eat.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="117.52" data-end="122.56"> But Jesus is effectively saying in that story, the priests made the right value judgment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="122.56" data-end="128.08"> This is the urgent thing that needs to happen here. And then Jesus goes on to indicate that</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="128.08" data-end="136.0"> all of this stuff, the Sabbath, propriety, everything exists in subservience and as a secondary value to</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.0" data-end="142.24"> proximity to the king, to the king himself. And then you think about the next chapter over in Matthew</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="142.24" data-end="147.68"> 13 and the two little micro parables about the pearl of great price and the treasure buried in</p>
