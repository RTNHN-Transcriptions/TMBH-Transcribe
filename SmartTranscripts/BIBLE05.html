        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="12.0"> We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Deuteronomy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="12.0" data-end="20.5"> Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="20.5" data-end="22.5"> Today we're on the fifth book of the Bible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="22.5" data-end="28.0"> This is the last book of the opening chunk of the Bible that Christians call the Pentateuch, Jews call the Torah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.0" data-end="35.0"> And all of this is written by Moses, but we get a very different version of Moses in all of them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="35.0" data-end="40.0"> And now that we're into the book of Deuteronomy, we are getting old man reflective Moses,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="40.0" data-end="44.0"> who is no longer throwing his energy at the other old people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="44.0" data-end="47.0"> He is throwing his energy at the next generation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="47.0" data-end="51.5"> And his motivation for this is more than just a reflection on his life and thinking,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="51.5" data-end="56.0"> I want to have a legacy here, and so I need to invest in these young people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="56.0" data-end="62.0"> There's something going on here in terms of God's relationship with the people that is prompting this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="62.0" data-end="68.0"> And that is, as you'll recall from the previous book Numbers, that it was only supposed to take two weeks</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="68.0" data-end="72.0"> to go from Mount Sinai where God gave the law at the end of Exodus.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="72.0" data-end="76.0"> Then at the beginning of Numbers, it's supposed to take like just two weeks to walk up to Canaan and be like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="76.0" data-end="78.0"> well, the God who did all that other miraculous stuff,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.0" data-end="82.0"> he's going to deliver these little kingdoms and tribes and stuff into our hands.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="82.0" data-end="87.0"> And then we're going to have the land that was promised to Abraham. This is so exciting.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="87.0" data-end="93.0"> But the people despite all they've seen, despite the fact that they're literally being led by like the visible presence</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="93.0" data-end="97.0"> of God with a cloud in the book of Numbers, they're just not up for it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="97.0" data-end="100.0"> They don't have the heart for it, and they're really complaining.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="100.0" data-end="104.0"> And in Numbers 14, the people decide, now we got to depose Moses, is the wrong leadership.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="104.0" data-end="107.0"> We're not going in and taking the land. We don't have any plan B.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="107.0" data-end="109.0"> I don't know what we're going to do instead.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="109.0" data-end="111.0"> But we can't go there. Maybe back to Egypt.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.0" data-end="113.0"> I don't know, but we're out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.0" data-end="119.0"> And then in one of the most horrifying passages in the whole Bible,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.0" data-end="125.0"> God responds to the people of Israel and is like, okay, I'm going to give you what you want.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.0" data-end="129.0"> For each of the 40 days, the spies were in there checking out the land.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.0" data-end="135.0"> You all are going to spend one year out here in the desert wandering around aimlessly</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="135.0" data-end="140.0"> until all of this generation who rejected my leadership as God</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.0" data-end="145.0"> are dead. And then the next generation will go in and take the land and we'll move forward with them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.0" data-end="148.0"> You're going to find out what it's like to have me against you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="148.0" data-end="151.0"> Dang.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="151.0" data-end="155.0"> Well, between what we hear about Numbers and what we get in Deuteronomy,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.0" data-end="161.0"> something like 40 years pass and a bunch of the old generation who complained</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.0" data-end="164.0"> and were stubborn and rejected God's leadership. They have died off.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="164.0" data-end="167.0"> In fact, they're almost all dead.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="167.0" data-end="172.0"> And now Israel is right at the doorstep of the promised land with a whole new generation</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="172.0" data-end="175.0"> that's been raised up and we come into the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.0" data-end="181.0"> And Deuteronomy on its surface, this looks incredibly boring and maybe redundant.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.0" data-end="184.0"> I'm not trying to be mean to the Bible. I really, really like it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="184.0" data-end="186.0"> That's why I do this podcast, why we're having these conversations.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="186.0" data-end="187.0"> I think it's great.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="187.0" data-end="191.0"> But come on, let's be honest, on the surface, it looks like we've already covered the material</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="191.0" data-end="195.0"> that's in Deuteronomy. Heck, even the name means second law,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="195.0" data-end="197.0"> like we're taking another run at this thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="197.0" data-end="204.0"> But a closer look at this book demonstrates that there's something really interesting happening here narratively</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="204.0" data-end="208.0"> and that we're learning more stuff about God and his character and their dented plan</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="208.0" data-end="210.0"> and how it's all going to play out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="210.0" data-end="213.0"> So the book is structured around a series of speeches from Moses.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.0" data-end="219.0"> The first speech is basically just a rehash of what we got in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="219.0" data-end="222.0"> with a lot of emphasis on Numbers.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="222.0" data-end="226.0"> So it's the story I was just recapping about everything that God has done</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="226.0" data-end="232.0"> and how the people behaved the way they did and why God has allowed them to wander in the desert for all this time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="232.0" data-end="236.0"> But who's Moses talking to in this speech and why does he have to review all of this?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="236.0" data-end="238.0"> Well, again, he's talking to the kids.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="238.0" data-end="241.0"> They don't get everything right in the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="241.0" data-end="246.0"> They're a little bit complaining, but not as much as their parents because they never knew Egypt</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="246.0" data-end="251.0"> and the relative stability, though it was slave stability, that was enjoyed there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.0" data-end="254.0"> In the desert, there's no sense of how the provision is going to happen.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="254.0" data-end="256.0"> It's dry and hot and miserable and boring.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="256.0" data-end="262.0"> And you might think of Egypt that way, but Egypt at this point in history was like the most fertile, lush, temperate place</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="262.0" data-end="268.0"> you could possibly imagine living except other than maybe Canaan, this land flowing of milk and honey</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="268.0" data-end="270.0"> that is promised to them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="270.0" data-end="274.0"> The point is this next generation, they ain't perfect, but they don't know all of these details</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="274.0" data-end="278.0"> and they might be assigning their own narrative to everything that's happened here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="278.0" data-end="286.0"> And Moses is like, no, I'm going to give you a recap so that you are crystal clear on what the actual narrative is</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="286.0" data-end="288.0"> and so that you understand it's not flattering.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="288.0" data-end="293.0"> He's like, I just got to boil it down to the point for these guys of all the law and the commands</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="293.0" data-end="295.0"> and everything else.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="295.0" data-end="301.0"> And so he says this in Deuteronomy 6, 4, hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="301.0" data-end="305.0"> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="322.0" data-end="325.0"> That is obviously a very famous passage.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="325.0" data-end="331.0"> This gets referenced in the Gospels, a whole bunch, Jesus affirms that this is the chief commandment</p>
