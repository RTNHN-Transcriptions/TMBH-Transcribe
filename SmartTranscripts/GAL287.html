        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="48.0" data-end="49.2"> worked out there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="49.2" data-end="51.64"> The first two are Derby and Lystra.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.06" data-end="155.34"> First, let's start with the Bible side.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.34" data-end="160.78"> There are a couple of teeny tiny little hints, a couple of references to a pair of characters</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="173.02" data-end="178.58"> Like it could be argued that we have records that say there were bishops from shortly after</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="178.58" data-end="184.78"> the time of Paul, like still late first century into the early second century.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="184.78" data-end="192.94"> That is to say that this church in Iconium, it seems to claim to have had leaders in that</p>
