        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="9.5"> Now the story of the Jewish exiles who lost everything, and the one man who had no choice but to help them rebuild it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="9.5" data-end="12.0"> It's the book of Nehemiah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="16.0" data-end="20.0"> If I were going to make a movie of the Bible, and I'm not at this time planning to make a movie of the Bible,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="20.0" data-end="26.0"> but if I were going to make a movie of the Bible, when I got to the part that is covered in Nehemiah chapter 3,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="26.0" data-end="31.0"> most of the building on the wall happens in Jerusalem under the leadership in Nehemiah,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="31.0" data-end="36.0"> I would definitely deploy a cinematic montage for this part.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="36.0" data-end="41.0"> There's too much here. The montages exist for a reason, right? You know what I'm talking about when I talk about that?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="41.0" data-end="48.0"> It's the parts and movies where you got to show a lot of growth on the part of the main character or the main characters,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="48.0" data-end="53.0"> but it's the kind of growth that in real life takes forever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.0" data-end="60.0"> But the audience needs to feel the passage of time in order to believe that the character is changed and grown</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="60.0" data-end="65.0"> and overcome what they need to overcome so that when they go back out and face whatever they need to face,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="65.0" data-end="68.0"> they're a new character they've grown in some way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="68.0" data-end="72.0"> Then you have to have a montage because you can't just show the whole thing it takes forever,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="72.0" data-end="78.0"> but you also just can't skip that growth and be like, oh, as a family, we have to build a house before winter comes,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.0" data-end="82.0"> and then in the very next shot there's a house, and everybody's just standing there proudly</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="82.0" data-end="88.0"> being like, we did it. That doesn't work. You have to feel as a viewer that labor, if you skip over it,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="88.0" data-end="92.0"> it feels like a Mary Sue, it feels like you skipped important character development,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="92.0" data-end="95.0"> but some character development takes a very long time. And so, of course, if you're making a movie,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="95.0" data-end="98.0"> you want to accelerate that a little bit, and that's why you use a montage.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="98.0" data-end="107.0"> And also montages need to have music, particularly soaring mid-1980s radio-friendly rock anthems</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="107.0" data-end="115.0"> with super vague lyrics about achieving things. You do not want lyrics that are overly specific</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.0" data-end="122.0"> to the situation. You just want stuff about hearts that are on fire and burning and yearning and courage</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="122.0" data-end="127.0"> and having what it takes to do what's right and stand up and be brave and never back down</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="127.0" data-end="134.0"> and discovering that the power was within you all along. It does not matter. Just make it rhyme and cram.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="134.0" data-end="141.0"> You could literally go and take 100 phrases like that, and as long as the phrases end with words like tonight</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="141.0" data-end="148.0"> or all right or heart or a part or fire or desire, you could just make a generator where you click a little box</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="148.0" data-end="154.0"> like generate montage song, and it could just put all those rhymes together, and literally it would work for any montage.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="154.0" data-end="162.0"> It absolutely does not matter as long as it follows these basic rules. So, we picked some song and we put it over the top of Nehemiah</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="162.0" data-end="169.0"> chapter three, and then the montage that covers all of this growth, all of this building that's happening in Nehemiah chapter</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="177.0" data-end="184.0"> You got to have an Achilles heel, a problem that the main character is trying to overcome. So, if you're doing a karate montage</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="184.0" data-end="190.0"> in some kind of karate kid style movie where you got to fight the bad guys and overcome the bullies or whatever,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="202.0" data-end="208.0"> is the sensei teaching the learner and boom, sweep the leg. He falls down. He didn't recognize it in the sensei.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="245.0" data-end="252.0"> We go through the whole thing and then finally we get to the end and he's getting closer with every try, a little bit of improvement until finally he recognizes the kick.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="252.0" data-end="259.0"> Boom, he puts his other foot down and blocks the kick. There's a quick moment of eye contact between the teacher and the student. Counter move, counter move.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="263.0" data-end="270.0"> And the teacher's like, all right, now you're ready as the final notes of the song play. That's how you do a montage.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="270.0" data-end="279.0"> So how do we take Nehemiah three, which is the whole bunch of building things and make that into a proper montage?

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="279.0" data-end="287.0"> I gave you a little bit of this last time around. We're just going to start from the beginning.

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="400.0" data-end="409.0"> It was a little easier to negotiate, to get people up and working if they would see the results right in front of them or to take ownership of the work and put better craftsmanship into it.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="417.0" data-end="422.0"> but look at the different classes of people. They're all coming together. They're all doing the thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="422.0" data-end="427.0"> So how do we translate this to a montage for this movie that we would make that we're not actually going to make?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="427.0" data-end="430.0"> Well, this is what I think we got to do. First of all, non-negotiable.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="445.0" data-end="454.0"> We got to build something structurally, but we also have to build a people because the people have not been able to come together and do what they're supposed to do</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="454.0" data-end="458.0"> and have sufficient unity and clarity of purpose to achieve these things.</p>
