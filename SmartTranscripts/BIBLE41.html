        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now, we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="11.5"> We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Mark.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="11.5" data-end="23.6"> The Book of Mark is so much like the Book of Matthew on its surface,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="23.6" data-end="28.0"> and that it is telling the story of Jesus from a very sympathetic perspective.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.0" data-end="31.2"> Obviously, Mark thinks Jesus is the Son of God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="31.2" data-end="35.2"> He thinks Jesus is the Savior of the world, and he wants you to believe that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="35.2" data-end="38.6"> So, at the most basic level, he's trying to accomplish the same thing that Matthew,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="38.6" data-end="40.8"> before him, was trying to accomplish.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="40.8" data-end="42.1"> He wants to get to the end.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="42.1" data-end="46.400000000000006"> He's going to wrap the book up pretty abruptly, just as Matthew did.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="46.400000000000006" data-end="48.900000000000006"> And the idea is, boom, balls in your court, reader.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="48.900000000000006" data-end="50.400000000000006"> What are you going to do with that?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="50.400000000000006" data-end="56.1"> But where Mark is very different is that he seems to be talking to a completely different audience</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="56.1" data-end="57.900000000000006"> than Matthew is writing to.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="58.199999999999996" data-end="63.8"> And as a result, he's pacing his book very differently because the audience he's writing to</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="63.8" data-end="67.2"> doesn't seem to be as interested in all the stuff from the Old Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="67.2" data-end="73.3"> In fact, it looks kind of like Mark is assuming his audience isn't very familiar with much of any of that at all.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="73.3" data-end="81.2"> And so the result is that we see a whole lot of stuff that Jesus did and a very fast-paced telling</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="81.2" data-end="83.7"> of the story we just got done with in Matthew.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.7" data-end="86.3"> And we get it with a lot fewer words from Jesus.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="86.3" data-end="92.1"> In fact, Mark records fewer than half of the total words of Jesus that we get in the book of Matthew.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="92.1" data-end="99.2"> Well, upon closer examination, we figure out that Mark was a guy who worked with the Apostle Paul.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.2" data-end="102.2"> He's part of Generation 2 of Christianity.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="102.2" data-end="106.9"> He traveled with the Apostle Paul in the Book of Acts, which we're going to get to here in a little bit.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="106.9" data-end="108.3"> But he had a falling out with Paul.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.3" data-end="111.0"> Paul didn't like his work ethic when he was a young man.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.0" data-end="115.5"> And so Mark goes on a different journey and he ends up working with some other people</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.5" data-end="119.5"> in the early years of the church and eventually starts palling around with Peter</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.5" data-end="123.5"> as a very close relationship with Peter and apparently wrote a bunch of things down</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.5" data-end="125.2"> that Peter had said again and again.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.2" data-end="130.5"> Well, Peter toward the end of his life ends up in Rome, talking to Roman people,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="130.5" data-end="134.6"> probably giving all kinds of sermons and recollections about the life of Jesus</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="134.6" data-end="142.4"> and all these insane, crazy world-changing things that happened during these three big years of Jesus' public life.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="142.4" data-end="147.6"> And we learn from the earliest extra-biblical sources that Mark wrote that stuff down</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="147.6" data-end="154.1"> and carefully organized it into a book that would make the whole Jesus thing make sense,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="154.1" data-end="158.4"> not to Jews like what Matthew was doing, but to Romans.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="158.4" data-end="161.4"> So as a result, Mark doesn't give us all the Old Testament stuff.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.4" data-end="165.9"> He doesn't give us nearly as many quotes or references to the Old Testament as Matthew does.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.9" data-end="168.6"> And when he does give us those, they're a little more veiled.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="168.6" data-end="173.79999999999998"> They're like Easter eggs that if part of his Roman audience figured out that Jesus was awesome</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="173.79999999999998" data-end="177.4"> and then dug deeper into it, they would catch those Easter eggs.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="177.4" data-end="179.79999999999998"> So there's no genealogy, there's no birth account.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="179.79999999999998" data-end="184.0"> We don't need to know right off the bat that Jesus has descended from David or any of that stuff at all.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="184.0" data-end="189.1"> Instead, the book of Mark opens with the throw down the gauntlet thesis statement</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="189.1" data-end="191.79999999999998"> right out of the gate that goes like this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="191.79999999999998" data-end="197.7"> First one of chapter one of Mark, the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="197.7" data-end="200.1"> Well, think about how that's going to sound to a Roman audience.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="200.1" data-end="201.89999999999998"> They have tons of gods.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="201.89999999999998" data-end="210.5"> So just the fact that God is singular and exclusive here is a bold truth claim in the face of the Roman cosmology,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="220.79999999999998" data-end="226.5"> He is the son of God and therefore kind of implicitly what Mark is saying in this opening line</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="226.5" data-end="231.1"> is like your government doesn't always get it right and their judgment was incorrect on this one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="231.1" data-end="236.1"> But here's an opportunity for you, Roman citizen, to take a look at this for yourself</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="236.1" data-end="240.5"> and perhaps arrive at a different and better conclusion.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="240.5" data-end="247.4"> And then Mark, knowing the Roman cultural appreciation for sooth saying and prophecy gives his audience</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="247.4" data-end="251.5"> a very quick reference to a prophet they've probably never heard of a guy named Isaiah</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="283.9" data-end="289.7"> Well, if we look at everything, Mark's recording and how he presents it, the next thing is always serving.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="294.09999999999997" data-end="296.2"> That would have got people's attention.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="296.2" data-end="303.4"> It's serving Jewish people. Well, you know, obviously you could do that, but it's also serving outsiders, Romans, Gentiles.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="303.4" data-end="308.59999999999997"> And through eight chapters, Mark paints this elaborate picture of a servant king.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="503.8" data-end="506.2"> We know who Jesus is from the first half of the book.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="523.9" data-end="532.0"> It looks like Mark paced this understanding that the attention span for an outsider to any of this larger story of the Bible would be a little bit smaller.</p>
