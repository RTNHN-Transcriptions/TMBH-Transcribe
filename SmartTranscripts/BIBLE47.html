        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="12.0"> We're covering one book each day, and this one's about second Corinthians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="12.0" data-end="25.0"> It looks like the Apostle Paul wrote at least four letters to the church in Corinth.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.0" data-end="30.0"> Two of those we still have, and both of the letters that we have between Paul and the church in Corinth,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="30.0" data-end="32.0"> are in the New Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.0" data-end="40.0"> So in 2 Corinthians, Paul is following up on stuff that he wrote to the very troubled church in Corinth</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="40.0" data-end="42.0"> in 1 Corinthians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="42.0" data-end="46.0"> And the positive note here, as we turn the page from 1 Corinthians to 2 Corinthians,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="46.0" data-end="48.0"> is it looked like it kind of worked.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="48.0" data-end="53.0"> It looks like things are getting better in Corinth, but they're not out of the woods.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.0" data-end="57.0"> This is clearly a very difficult church.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="57.0" data-end="61.0"> And at first glance, from a couple thousand years away, it might be easy to be like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="61.0" data-end="63.0"> well, these people were just clearly inferior.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="63.0" data-end="65.0"> They just weren't very good at being Christians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="65.0" data-end="71.0"> But if you look a little more closely at the background of Corinth, like you and I tried to do in our last conversation on 1 Corinthians,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.0" data-end="73.0"> I think you feel a little more empathetic.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="73.0" data-end="80.0"> Now, look, last time around, we talked about the reality that there's an almost millennium-old sex cult</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="80.0" data-end="84.0"> to the goddess Aphrodite that had always been associated with Corinth.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="84.0" data-end="90.0"> I mean, it's their patron goddess is the goddess associated with sex and licentiousness.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.0" data-end="92.0"> That's going to leave a mark on the culture.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="92.0" data-end="97.0"> But something we didn't talk about last time was the political instability of Corinth.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="97.0" data-end="102.0"> Corinth as a proud history, by the time we encounter it in the first century,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="102.0" data-end="105.0"> it's one of the great ancient Greek cities.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.0" data-end="111.0"> Whenever you see that fuzzy, topped Mohawk helmet in any kind of depiction of Greek warfare,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.0" data-end="113.0"> that's called a Corinthian helmet.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.0" data-end="115.0"> They were proud allies of the Spartans.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.0" data-end="117.0"> They also fought against the Spartans.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="117.0" data-end="119.0"> All the Greeks fought against each other at some point or another.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.0" data-end="127.0"> But then in the middle of the second century BC, as the Roman Republic is really getting into that expansion mode,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="127.0" data-end="133.0"> there are problems in Greece and a couple of prominent Roman leaders get dispatched to go</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="133.0" data-end="136.0"> and finally get Greece under control.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.0" data-end="142.0"> In the midst of that campaign, Corinth gets caught up and it gets wiped out by the Romans,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="142.0" data-end="146.0"> who were in the habit of doing that to trouble some cities from time to time,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="146.0" data-end="148.0"> see Carthage in North Africa.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="148.0" data-end="152.0"> Well, Corinth just goes dormant for a hundred years.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.0" data-end="158.0"> And coincidentally, that hundred years that Corinth is more or less gone corresponds pretty closely</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="158.0" data-end="163.0"> to the hundred years that the Jews had their independent Maccabean kingdom</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.0" data-end="165.0"> before the Romans came and shut that down.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.0" data-end="169.0"> Well, about the same time that the Romans come and shut down the Maccabean kingdom,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="169.0" data-end="174.0"> they also go and start back up resuscitate, revive the city of Corinth.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="174.0" data-end="179.0"> But not as a Greek city, it's a straight up Roman colony.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="179.0" data-end="186.0"> Like they took Roman citizens and Roman government and they dropped it right over the top of the ruins of ancient Corinth.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="186.0" data-end="192.0"> So this is a town then that is emblematic of the vigorous shaking up of the ant farm</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="192.0" data-end="197.0"> and the new pathways that cut as a result of the ancient Mediterranean world</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="202.0" data-end="208.0"> When we understand Corinth in this way, we understand how crazy it must have looked</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="208.0" data-end="215.0"> to everybody in early Christianity to try to go and start a church there, let alone persist,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="215.0" data-end="222.0"> as soon as things predictably went off the rails, Corinth lacked identity, Corinth lacked integrity,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="222.0" data-end="225.0"> Corinth lacked roots, it lacked grounding.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="225.0" data-end="231.0"> Fair or not, it was a town that was a metaphor for chasing after whatever is recent and expedient.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="231.0" data-end="233.0"> It just doesn't seem like that's a place where you want to go.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="233.0" data-end="238.0"> If you want to have a church that is going to work out great, yet the New Testament holds out God as ordaining</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="238.0" data-end="243.0"> and Paul as enthusiastically going right to the heart of the mess</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="246.0" data-end="247.0"> Now, why?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="247.0" data-end="251.0"> Well, the most basic level, of course, because you want to see the most lost,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.0" data-end="254.0"> reached with the message, the words of life of Jesus.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="254.0" data-end="255.0"> So there's that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="255.0" data-end="261.0"> But additionally, I think first and second Corinthians are in the Bible to give us an example of what it looks like</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="261.0" data-end="267.0"> to persist in faith and the worship of God and doing redemptive things</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="301.0" data-end="305.0"> So the timeline with Corinth is really interesting as it pertains to second Corinthians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="305.0" data-end="310.0"> The church was probably founded around 50 AD, the details of that are recorded in Acts 18.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="310.0" data-end="315.0"> And then Paul writes a letter having heard about trouble in Corinth</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="318.0" data-end="324.0"> We don't have the text of that first actual letter we're aware of to the Corinthians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="324.0" data-end="327.0"> So I'm going to call that Corinthians A.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="327.0" data-end="329.0"> That's the A letter.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="329.0" data-end="335.0"> And it looks like that was a difficult letter meant to begin to address problems.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="335.0" data-end="340.0"> Then we get the B letter to the Corinthians, which we call first Corinthians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="340.0" data-end="343.0"> This was probably written around 57 AD.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="343.0" data-end="347.0"> And as you recall from the conversation yesterday, it was confrontational.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="384.0" data-end="387.0"> of about a year in 57 AD.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="387.0" data-end="391.0"> So we have Corinthian letter A, Corinthian letter B, which is known as first Corinthians,</p>
