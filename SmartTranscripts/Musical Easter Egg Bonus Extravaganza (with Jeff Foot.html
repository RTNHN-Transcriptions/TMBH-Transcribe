        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="126.6" data-end="132.6"> I mean, it's a worthwhile prize pack, and if you want the ice cream sandwich that I mentioned several episodes earlier</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="132.6" data-end="135.6"> As a prize is gonna get gross, but I can do it</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="146.6" data-end="151.6"> Oh yeah, because I did the one where I did the horrible voice acting for the intro, that was bad</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="151.6" data-end="155.6"> And then like a couple episodes later, you were talking about Jesus' reputation</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="160.6" data-end="163.6"> So that's why we did it without vocals</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.6" data-end="166.6"> That's good, and nobody got mad</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="166.6" data-end="168.6"> And then it just took off from there</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="168.6" data-end="171.6"> Okay, second question, are there any that you know of that we didn't air?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="171.6" data-end="175.6"> Yeah, we didn't air, you did head over heels by</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="202.6" data-end="204.6"> Okay, final question</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="204.6" data-end="209.6"> How did we get through 400 episodes of you and me and not do a Tom Petty song?</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.6" data-end="215.6"> We should make one of those, I'm gonna find an excuse</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="215.6" data-end="216.6"> Okay, you watch</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="216.6" data-end="218.6"> Sometime in the next one or two weeks</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="218.6" data-end="222.6"> I will say something that completely fits into what we're talking about</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="222.6" data-end="227.6"> But it will really serve the other purpose of giving you an excuse to make song</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="230.6" data-end="234.6"> But you do that sometimes where you hope that I'll pick up on it and do the song</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="234.6" data-end="235.6"> Yes</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="235.6" data-end="236.6"> And we've had that</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="236.6" data-end="237.6"> Have UHF</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="242.6" data-end="243.6"> Or something</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="243.6" data-end="246.6"> But it was some line from Cooney on UHF</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="246.6" data-end="248.6"> And there's no way that's getting past me</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="248.6" data-end="249.6"> No, no, clearly not</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="249.6" data-end="251.6"> Okay, so here's what we're gonna do</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.6" data-end="254.6"> I have already eliminated several contestants</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="254.6" data-end="256.6"> There were a ton of entries</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="256.6" data-end="259.6"> And we've got a few here that serve as a really nice template</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="259.6" data-end="261.6"> And I've poked around at some of these</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="261.6" data-end="263.6"> So we are going to start</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="265.6" data-end="271.6"> The deal was that you just email me your guests as to what the songs meant</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="271.6" data-end="273.6"> And why they were in the episodes</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="273.6" data-end="275.6"> And these are not direct covers, right Jeff?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="275.6" data-end="277.6"> No, a lot of times it's just based on my memory</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="277.6" data-end="279.6"> Of how I remember that song</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="285.6" data-end="289.6"> And then I just try to replicate it as best as I can remember so that it isn't too close</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="289.6" data-end="292.6"> I'm changing the instrumentation obviously, we're doing it without vocals</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="292.6" data-end="295.6"> But I don't want to just create a karaoke track, cause then it would be a cover</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="295.6" data-end="297.6"> I try to make it my own somehow</p>
