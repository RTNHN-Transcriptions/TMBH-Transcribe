        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="9.5"> Now the story of the Jewish exiles who lost everything, and the one man who had no choice but to help them rebuild it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="9.5" data-end="12.0"> It's the book of Nehemiah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="16.0" data-end="21.5"> How stupid an idea do you think it is for me to open an episode with COVID as an example?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="21.5" data-end="25.0"> A one out of ten. You can just scream the number to the heavens right now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.0" data-end="27.5"> Oh my gosh, you're all saying like eights and nines.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="27.5" data-end="30.6"> Well, now I'm committed. I'm married to excited. I was going to do it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="30.6" data-end="35.3"> So this is going to happen. Hey, you all remember COVID?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="35.3" data-end="41.5"> It was awful. This is the horrible, horrible thing that we all went through very recently.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="41.5" data-end="47.8"> There's disease and suffering and uncertainty and fighting and even death.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="47.8" data-end="53.0"> Every single one of you who's here in this was touched by the whole COVID thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.0" data-end="61.3"> I'm not going to give into the temptation to offer a whole bunch of opinions about how the things ought to be or should have been.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="61.3" data-end="66.6"> Some of them are probably going to leak through because I can't help it, but I'm not trying to let them leak through.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="66.6" data-end="71.7"> Someday, there'll be a big conversation about all of that when we're all in a little better place with each other.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.7" data-end="78.0"> And I think there will be a lot of wisdom to be gleaned from an honest evaluation of what we got right and what we got wrong.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.0" data-end="80.7"> And that'll be super. That's not what I want to talk about.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="80.7" data-end="88.5"> What I do want to talk about is something that is a little more nonpartisan, neutral and that affected everybody.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="88.5" data-end="91.7"> And that is the economic side of this thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="91.7" data-end="97.7"> Very shortly after the initial two weeks to flatten the curve thing, you started to hear rumblings from people live in paycheck to paycheck.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="97.7" data-end="99.5"> We're like, hey, you know, two weeks.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.5" data-end="103.1"> Okay, we can kind of do that, but this isn't going to keep working.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="103.1" data-end="105.0"> I have to go back to work. We have to eat.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.1" data-end="107.1"> I can't pay my bills like this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="107.1" data-end="119.6"> And with each passing week, that outcry rose through the respective tax brackets until a pretty significant percentage of society was saying, this isn't going to work.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.6" data-end="121.2"> We got to change our mitigation approach.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="121.2" data-end="125.3"> We got to do something differently because the bills aren't getting paid.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.3" data-end="134.1"> We have a bona fide crisis on our hands and the government tried printing money and we can't really get on our partisan high horse about that one because both parties printed a ton of money.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="134.1" data-end="140.79999999999998"> And of course, that has had very damaging effects on the economy and you print a lot of money, you get a lot of inflation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.79999999999998" data-end="148.7"> And that's been a pretty bitter pill for, I think, everybody to swallow regardless of what tax bracket you happen to be in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="148.7" data-end="154.9"> And as I'm sitting here recording this, that's something we're still trying to sort out and figure out how to fix.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="154.9" data-end="161.4"> And that's part of why I wanted to bring up this example is because it's something that we not just recently feel.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.8" data-end="184.0"> We all currently, as I am sitting at this microphone, feel the effects of a pressing crisis that was felt culture wide, civilization wide, really just about worldwide and that had massive economic ramifications such that we really found ourselves in a place where we had two values in conflict.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="184.0" data-end="188.0"> One was, you got to mitigate this disease, you got to do something about it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="188.0" data-end="195.0"> And the other was, hey, the destruction of the economy is getting close to outpacing the danger of the disease.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="195.0" data-end="197.6"> We have to fire this thing back up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="197.6" data-end="202.3"> You can't just turn off an economy and then turn it back on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="202.3" data-end="208.9"> Look, if you get that and I realize it's a super risky analogy and example to bring up because we're all still raw about it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="208.9" data-end="220.6"> But I do think this is one of the rare places where we can really, freshly and recently empathize with the situation that is on the page in the Bible in the passage we're looking at.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="220.6" data-end="233.9"> We're in the book of Nehemiah, the Jewish exiles, they got taken into captivity 140 years before the stuff we're looking at Nehemiah, but then over the course of the last few generations leading up to the part of the Bible that we're looking at here,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="233.9" data-end="247.9"> the Jewish exiles are being allowed to go home under the leadership of the Persian kings and they've rebuilt the temple and slowly they've rebuilt Jerusalem and they somewhere along the lines kind of may do with sorta some walls, but the walls are a mess.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="247.9" data-end="251.20000000000002"> They're broken down, the gates are destroyed, they got enemies at the gates.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.20000000000002" data-end="258.2"> It's a long way from the home office of Persia and they are in danger of losing the ground they've taken.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="258.5" data-end="264.7"> The entire prospect of the Jewish people being reestablished as a people is on a razor's edge.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="264.9" data-end="274.7"> If they can get those walls built and the gates in place, they can rise to their feet and no longer be returning exiles, but be returned exiles.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="275.2" data-end="287.5"> But if they can't get those walls built, we've already seen that the enemies are licking their chops and the whole prospect will fall off the other direction and they will be defeated, destroyed, forgotten to history.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="287.5" data-end="299.2"> Their new generation of enemies will accomplish what Haman was unable to accomplish a generation earlier, thwarted by the bravery, encourage of Esther and Mordecai by the providence of God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="299.5" data-end="304.4"> So here we are in Nehemiah 5 with really a COVID corollary.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="304.7" data-end="311.8"> There is a crisis that is so pressing and so right now that everything else has to be set aside.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="311.8" data-end="323.3"> The enemies are quite literally at the gates seeking the destruction of the Jewish people, but by the grace of God, Nehemiah was in a position to petition the king of kings, art as Xerxes of Persia.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="323.3" data-end="326.8"> And for just a moment here, the Jews have the favor of the Persians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="326.8" data-end="328.3"> They have enough resources.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="328.3" data-end="335.3"> They've got a second here where if they can get this wall built, they will again become not returning exiles, but returned exiles.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="335.3" data-end="336.3"> So it's a crisis.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="336.3" data-end="337.3"> It's a right now thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="337.3" data-end="338.0"> It's urgent.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="338.0" data-end="339.5"> Everything else gets set aside.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="339.5" data-end="341.8"> And we see that in Nehemiah chapter 3.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="342.0" data-end="357.5"> Remember, it's kind of the boring chapter that we went through or is like, and then Ted built this part of the wall, then then Ronnie, the garbage man and his family built the part of the wall that was by the garbage man house and then Gary and Sheila, their perfumers rebuilt the dung tower and so on and so forth all the way through.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="357.5" data-end="362.0"> Well, what we see in chapter 3 is these are normal people with normal jobs.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="362.2" data-end="369.3"> Well, guess what they ain't doing while they're rebuilding this wall working, running their businesses, collecting revenues,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="369.3" data-end="371.1"> the same thing you weren't doing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="371.1" data-end="375.3"> And I wasn't doing when COVID was in full swing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="375.6" data-end="383.8"> Now, just like a little bit after two weeks to flatten the curve in 2020, we start to hear the rumblings of injustice.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="383.8" data-end="390.6"> We start to hear people who are in a vulnerable economic situation saying, Hey, this is getting desperate.</p>
