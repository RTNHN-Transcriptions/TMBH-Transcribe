        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="29.0" data-end="33.0"> This time from Matthew chapter 5, which matches where we are in Matthew chapter 23</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="33.0" data-end="37.0"> and talking about the Pharisees and their plan to get people into the kingdom</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="37.0" data-end="40.0"> and Jesus' perspective on that plan.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="40.0" data-end="45.0"> Now, if you're wondering why we do this, there are a few weeks every year baked into the schedule for patrons</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="45.0" data-end="49.0"> where they are not charged for a week of episodes. One of those weeks was last month in November.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="49.0" data-end="53.0"> We did still release episodes that week so that Matt could take this week off.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="75.0" data-end="79.0"> We know this conversation and you get that little little fighter-flight</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.0" data-end="87.0"> It's the one where you define something really important. It's the one where you get a new boss</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="87.0" data-end="91.0"> at work and the new boss in the first couple of days is like, you know what,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="91.0" data-end="94.0"> let's have a conversation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="94.0" data-end="98.0"> I can sit you down. You're like, okay, maybe I'm getting fired.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="98.0" data-end="103.0"> Something's about to change. You kind of wonder, there's all the stuff that I know how to do that work</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="107.0" data-end="112.0"> And hopefully if that conversation goes well, you come out the other side knowing exactly how things are now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="112.0" data-end="116.0"> The same thing happens in dating. I mean, for that matter, the same thing happens in church.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="116.0" data-end="120.0"> You get a new pastor, that kind of conversation occurs. There are these moments</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="120.0" data-end="124.0"> where we had a lot of moving parts and we seemed to sit down</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="124.0" data-end="128.0"> and make eye contact and really drill down on where we at,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="128.0" data-end="132.0"> what is our relationship, what are the ground rules here, and how are we moving forward.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="132.0" data-end="136.0"> We're getting to that place in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapter 5.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.0" data-end="140.0"> Here's the quick reset. Going all the way back through the Old Testament</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.0" data-end="143.0"> and looking at the promises that God had made to the people of Israel,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="143.0" data-end="146.0"> promises that were about the redemption of all humankind,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="146.0" data-end="150.0"> but this story was to be carried out through God's chosen people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="150.0" data-end="154.0"> So we remember this story about God making an unconditional promise,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="154.0" data-end="159.0"> Abraham, who picked out of the clear blue sky. I'm just going to redeem with you, I guess.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="159.0" data-end="164.0"> Very cool. So he makes this promise that he's going to be this great nation that he's going to have all these descendants</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="164.0" data-end="168.0"> and that all the nations will be blessed by Abraham if he just</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="168.0" data-end="172.0"> nothing, nothing. He can screw up as much as he screws up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="172.0" data-end="176.0"> God is ultimately going to do that redemptive thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="176.0" data-end="181.0"> And then we learn more about another promise that God made, a covenant that he made with Moses.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.0" data-end="185.0"> And this promise was that the Hebrews were going to be the people of God</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="185.0" data-end="188.0"> and God was going to be their people and when they obeyed God, God was going to bless them</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="188.0" data-end="191.0"> and when they disobeyed God, God was going to punish them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="191.0" data-end="194.0"> And you've heard this so many times, you could probably do it yourself.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="194.0" data-end="201.0"> But whether they obey or disobey, everyone around them was going to know that their God was the one true God</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="201.0" data-end="205.0"> because he would follow through every time based on their obedience or disobedience.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="205.0" data-end="209.0"> Then we talked about this Davidic covenant. The covenant with David comes much later.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="209.0" data-end="213.0"> We've seen the ups and downs of God's chosen people. They got a few things right.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.0" data-end="218.0"> They got a bunch of things wrong. Now they want a king, the king that came before David wasn't so great.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="218.0" data-end="223.0"> And now here is David and David says, God, we need to reorient ourselves to you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="223.0" data-end="229.0"> I want to build you this great big elaborate temple and consecrate your people to you once again.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="229.0" data-end="232.0"> And God's like, cool, I'm actually going to have your kid do that later.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="232.0" data-end="237.0"> Here's what my deal is for you. Instead of you making me something, I'm going to make you something.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="237.0" data-end="245.0"> An unconditional covenant that from your line will come a line of kings that will be responsible for an eternal kingdom.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="245.0" data-end="249.0"> And the great king is going to come out of this line.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="249.0" data-end="256.0"> And so the Old Testament is a story that is very easy for us when we get to the New Testament to just ignore.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="256.0" data-end="260.0"> Wow, I really like this Jesus stuff better. This is way more fun.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="260.0" data-end="264.0"> There's nice things in here. There are little clever sayings like those chicken soup for the soul books.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="264.0" data-end="271.0"> He's easy. I get him. The Old Testament seems like people get killed and stuff and there's some weird things and possibly a bit of incest.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="271.0" data-end="277.0"> And I don't really like that very much. So we can easily dismiss it as a bunch of stories that are confusing that we don't know what to do with.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="277.0" data-end="286.0"> But if we see the structure of what God is doing there, then instead of it being a burden that we drag with us a liability to our faith that we bring into the New Testament,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="286.0" data-end="291.0"> it instead becomes this thing that sheds light completely on what God is doing next.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="291.0" data-end="297.0"> Because Jesus at no point comes along and says, remember all that stuff that God did before?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="297.0" data-end="304.0"> We're done with that. That didn't work. Our bad. We had a plan. We had like a long Trinity lunch.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="304.0" data-end="309.0"> And we thought we had it all mapped out, but we got distracted. There's sports on in the background.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="309.0" data-end="315.0"> And our game plan, it obviously wasn't quite the right one. But we've had another long lunch, the three of us.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="315.0" data-end="320.0"> And this time, the plan is totally going to work. You all are going to be Christians and you're going to love it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="320.0" data-end="324.0"> So I'm Jesus and I'm back to straighten out how it's going to be now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="324.0" data-end="330.0"> No, people will tell you that. Maybe they won't say it overtly, but people will act like that when they talk theology.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="330.0" data-end="339.0"> It's not the case at all. The New Testament is the fulfillment, the completion, the extension of what God was doing in the Old Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="339.0" data-end="350.0"> This is one cohesive, redemptive narrative that we have the benefit of understanding in hindsight,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="350.0" data-end="354.0"> as opposed to these people who were here listening to Jesus talk about this in Matthew chapter 5.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="354.0" data-end="361.0"> We were trying to wrap their brains around it on the side of a mountain as they had a lot of things bouncing around in their head.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="361.0" data-end="367.0"> In Matthew 5, we are going to get to the define the relationship conversation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="367.0" data-end="374.0"> We're getting to the big question that everybody needed to have sorted out, which is what do we do with all the old stuff.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="374.0" data-end="381.0"> So let's say you're a Jewish person and Jesus has just done all these miracles over the course of the past year or so.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="381.0" data-end="385.0"> You think there must be something to him. He gets up and he starts giving this speech and he's like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="385.0" data-end="389.0"> Hey, blessed are all the things you think aren't blessed.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="389.0" data-end="398.0"> Huh? That's right. In my kingdom, blessed is this and this and this and the merciful and blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and blessed are the meek.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="398.0" data-end="401.0"> And blessed are you when you get persecuted. Huh?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="401.0" data-end="407.0"> So he lays out this upside down kingdom and you're sitting there going,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="415.0" data-end="419.0"> I get all those stories. They're true. They're compelling.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="419.0" data-end="432.0"> Jesus seems true in compelling. In this teaching, though, I don't fully get it yet about this upside down kingdom, this greater, truer reality that lays over the top and ultimately will trump the reality we live in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="432.0" data-end="438.0"> And that's compelling. Yeah, that sounds like the kind of world I would want to live in, but I don't know what to do with this thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="438.0" data-end="442.0"> And then Jesus goes further into the persecution deal. He's like, whoa.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="442.0" data-end="447.0"> So not only do I not know what to do with this, but it's going to hurt if I sign up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="447.0" data-end="452.0"> Well, that seems like the kind of thing that somebody wouldn't just throw in if they were trying to do a cheap sales tactic.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="452.0" data-end="456.0"> Okay, I'm compelled, but I'm torn between these two things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="456.0" data-end="474.0"> So as you put yourself in the shoes of the original audience to whom Jesus was speaking, I want you to try to come at this, not as someone who has been raised around one expression of faith, but I instead want you to picture yourself as someone who has raised around one thing with absolute</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="474.0" data-end="491.0"> certitude with the full weight of ethnic identity behind this religion.

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="491.0" data-end="503.0"> And then imagine something irrefutably compelling comes along, something that doesn't seem like maybe it exactly fits in your brain yet with all those things you're sure of that God is behind.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="503.0" data-end="507.0"> But it's Max of truth, and you're compelled.</p>
