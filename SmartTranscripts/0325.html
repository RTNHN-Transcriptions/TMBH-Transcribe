        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="13.200000000000001"> For the second day in a row, I would like to offer a pre-music disclaimer that says that we're going to get into some issues of human intimacy in some rather odd expressions.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="13.200000000000001" data-end="19.1"> And since I know that many of you listen with your kids, I always think it's cool to give you a heads up when we're headed in that direction.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="19.1" data-end="34.38"> You have been advised. Thank you for heating my disclaimer. Alright, let's get after it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="34.38" data-end="47.1"> Yesterday I took probably way too much time on the front end talking about the invisible visceral reactions that happen deep within me, deep within other people, I think.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="47.1" data-end="52.9"> When we get called out on something that we rightly need to be called out on, it is an awful feeling.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="52.9" data-end="63.0"> It's gross. It's this moment of feeling like the gig is up. We feel this weird cocktail of regret and resentment of the person who said it and also embarrassment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="63.0" data-end="68.9"> How many other people see this going on too? Oh, my life is a wreck. What the heck am I doing?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="68.9" data-end="77.7"> You swirl all of that together in the drink and it doesn't taste particularly good going down. But when it's all said and done, we're going to handle that pushback one of two ways.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="77.7" data-end="82.7"> We're going to begrudgingly lean into it, acknowledging that, yeah, you have a point as being kind of dumb.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="82.7" data-end="91.30000000000001"> My bad. I need to change some stuff. Or we are going to double down on destroying the person who called it out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="91.3" data-end="109.3"> And in Matthew 14, we are running into a scenario where somebody is rightly called out, not even based on my own personal preferences or standards or modern mores that I approve of, but based on the agreed upon societal standards, religious standards, even legal standards of the day.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="109.3" data-end="121.1"> What we're talking about here is a scenario where somebody got rightly called out and rather than responding with humility, they melted down and tried to destroy the person who rightly called them out and send a message to any other person.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="121.1" data-end="128.1"> Any other possible whistleblowers that should they call out this behavior, they will get burned down as well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="128.1" data-end="138.1"> Once again, here's the passage. Matthew chapter 14. At that time, that time being right after Jesus got run out of Nazareth because nobody really liked his teaching and he didn't do many miracles there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="138.1" data-end="146.1"> It says, at that time, Herod the Tetra occurred the reports about Jesus and he said to his attendants, this is John the Baptist. He's risen from the dead.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="146.1" data-end="155.1"> That's why miraculous powers were working him. Now, Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother, Philip's wife for John had been saying to him.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.1" data-end="161.1"> It's not lawful for you to have her. Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people because they considered him a prophet.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.1" data-end="169.1"> So Herod's over a barrel. He did a thing that he's not supposed to do. We looked at Leviticus, whatever it was, 18, I think 16 yesterday.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="169.1" data-end="176.1"> It's a super obvious verse about like, hey, you're not supposed to have sex with your brother's wife. That would dishonor your brother, obviously.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="176.1" data-end="193.1"> And so that rule is in place. Herod knew dang well what he was doing when he disregarded that rule. It's not like he's offending some overly offendable religious conservatives or fundamentalist people who were, you know, being actively demonized by the majority of society at that time. No, no, no, no.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="193.1" data-end="208.1"> Everybody was down with this ground rule that it's not cool to have sex with your brother's wife, let alone steal your brother's wife and then just have sex with her like all the time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="208.1" data-end="221.1"> And now as we're into day two of looking at this confrontation, that's impossible not to notice all of the additional human psychological soul level layers of what's going on here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="221.1" data-end="229.1"> So nobody else is saying this to him. I mean, if so, we'd probably hear about all the other people who ended up getting arrested for calling out Herod Antipas.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="229.1" data-end="247.1"> But no, it's just John. And this is where you've got a guy who has nothing to lose and therefore is not afraid to say things that are incredibly true right in the face of power right in the face of the person who has all the authority in the world to damage this person's body, this person's life,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="247.1" data-end="258.1"> to deprive them of freedom, to deprive them of food, to spread rumors about them. All the power in this scenario in a world kingdom sense is in the court of Herod the Tetrak.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="258.1" data-end="271.1"> None of the power is with the homeless weirdo that eats bugs for a living out in the desert. And so in this case, John is actually really well positioned to say things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="271.1" data-end="289.1"> Now, why did other people say things? Well, one reason that other people might not have said anything is because they had something going on the side with their brother's wife, people who are getting something wrong that they see other people getting wrong as well tend to not want to bring that up because</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="289.1" data-end="298.1"> intuitively, I think we all know that whatever measure we use is going to get used on us. It certainly gives me pause about going around and hassling other people about their problems.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="298.1" data-end="310.1"> Because I've had problems. I still have problems. If I do bring any of those things up, my goodness, I want to fall over myself to be gracious and patient and acknowledge that we're all flawed.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="310.1" data-end="319.1"> So maybe some people who've stayed quiet because they got their own problems. But beyond that, I think other people have stayed quiet because they are vested.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="319.1" data-end="330.1"> They have things that could go away. They'd achieved a certain level of comfort or functionality that obligations, a family, whatever. Look, you cross Herod.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="330.1" data-end="339.1"> You're crossing somebody who can destroy you, who can make it so that you'll never work in this town again or anywhere again. Maybe take your hands. Maybe take your head.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="339.1" data-end="356.1"> Maybe just lock you up in a gulag somewhere forever. This is not America pre-2018 when you could say pretty much whatever you wanted and people might be really offended and irritated with you, but nobody was going to do anything about it because it's just words now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="356.1" data-end="368.1"> Admittedly, since then, it's a little different, isn't it? Since then, maybe we find the situation that we're in now to be a bit more relatable to the situation that all the other Christians are in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="368.1" data-end="374.1"> The situation that all the other critics or would be critics of Herod Antipas' behavior were in back then.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="374.1" data-end="383.1"> I'm guessing a ton of people ran the same math problem that people like me who do what I do for a living have to run every time we turn on a microphone.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="383.1" data-end="397.1"> Look, you and I both know that there are multiple combinations of words that I could throw out over the next 10 seconds right now, 10 seconds that would absolutely obliterate my ability to make it happen.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="397.1" data-end="408.1"> The ability to work or live on the internet that would result in a firestorm of chaos and maybe it would be deserved because there are some really offensive things that you can say in 10 seconds.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="408.1" data-end="425.1"> But we both know that we live in a hyper word-judgy moment in history where we have equated words to violence and we've got this whole new formula worked out for justifying making it so other people don't say words we don't like anymore.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="425.1" data-end="428.1"> And look, there's no point in trying to hide it. I am not down with that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="428.1" data-end="438.1"> Freedom of speech is super dangerous and the only more dangerous system is enforcing some sort of combination of societal, corporate and governmental controlling of speech.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="438.1" data-end="441.1"> That's the only thing that's more dangerous than freedom of speech.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="441.1" data-end="450.1"> So given those two, I'm just going to take my chances with people saying things that I don't like, that I think might even be dangerous or problematic, and just living with it and working with it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="450.1" data-end="455.1"> That's where I come down. Maybe you come down somewhere differently. I can tell you where Herod came down.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="455.1" data-end="463.1"> Freedom of speech was not exactly at the top of his social contract to-do list with the people that he covered.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="463.1" data-end="466.1"> Freedom of what? Huh, pardon? I am the law.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="466.1" data-end="470.1"> And if you say things I don't like, you're going to feel it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="470.1" data-end="479.1"> So think carefully about what you utter in your households, in the synagogue, on street corners because I am listening and people loyal to me are loyal to me.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="479.1" data-end="484.1"> Do not cross me with your words. And Herod could surely go on to boast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="484.1" data-end="490.1"> And if you don't think I'm serious about this, remember the severed head of John the Baptist?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="490.1" data-end="494.1"> Well, that's what happens to people who speak seditious words.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="494.1" data-end="499.1"> We see some parallels to what we understand and what we live with today.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="499.1" data-end="503.1"> You know there are some edgy words that you can say that will cost you nothing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="503.1" data-end="508.1"> Those words that might seem brave are actually really not that brave at all because there's very little risk.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="508.1" data-end="513.1"> Or you can just target your very edgy words at somebody who can't do anything to you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="513.1" data-end="519.1"> And it works out, but you and I also know that there are all kinds of other combinations of words where we run the equation and we go,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="519.1" data-end="529.1"> ooh, even if I did think that and I don't, I better dang well, not say that because that would irritate people who are powerful enough to actually do something about it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="529.1" data-end="533.1"> Or maybe there's some stuff that is true that just needs to be said.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="533.1" data-end="543.1"> And nobody wants to say those things anymore because the powers that be simply won't have it and eventually in society people get cowed and they don't say things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="543.1" data-end="553.1"> Not because they don't believe things and not because those things they believe aren't true, but because they're running a math equation where self preservation ends up being the biggest factor.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="553.1" data-end="564.1"> What we've got here is a speech controlling despot who is using his power to make sure that he is for all time above any kind of meaningful criticism and he's making an example of John the Baptist.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="564.1" data-end="568.1"> Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people because they considered him a prophet.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="568.1" data-end="574.1"> So Herod's so mad about getting called out and how right John actually is that he wants out and out kill him.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="574.1" data-end="575.1"> Somebody sees the gig.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="575.1" data-end="576.1"> The gig is up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="576.1" data-end="578.1"> The manipulator, the controlling type.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="578.1" data-end="586.1"> If you want to take them down, just stand up and loud and clear, look them in the eye, maybe even in front of other people and be like, here's exactly what you're doing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="586.1" data-end="591.1"> And that manipulator will melt down because all they have is the manipulation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="591.1" data-end="592.1"> John does that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="592.1" data-end="594.1"> Herod goes into full rage mode.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="594.1" data-end="600.1"> I want you dead because John's words are a threat to Herod's life, his credibility, his power.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="618.1" data-end="619.1"> So why doesn't he go?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="619.1" data-end="622.1"> Well, again, verse five, because people liked John.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="622.1" data-end="627.1"> We're reminded that ultimately power does lie with the masses.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="676.1" data-end="681.1"> And Herod is at least in touch with reality enough to get that.</p>
