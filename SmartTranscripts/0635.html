        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="17.72" data-end="21.240000000000002"> by their buddies over on the government side of things.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="31.04" data-end="38.24"> on. And it's been really fun gaming out here, why they're making the moves they're making</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="38.24" data-end="42.24"> and how they're making the moves that they're making. So let's pick it up from yesterday</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="42.24" data-end="48.0"> with this. Fast forward over here to chapter 26 once again. And it says that they have</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="48.0" data-end="52.16"> to go about this thing in a sly way. They're having a secret meeting in a place nobody</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="57.239999999999995" data-end="61.76"> okay, look, we can't make this arrest at the wrong time because we get the country come</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="66.88" data-end="71.72"> So we got to carry out this arrest in a way that's clever. It's off the books. It's out</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.72" data-end="78.0"> of the public eye. And that's something I just had never thought about before. You got</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.0" data-end="82.32"> a role on your side. You got your like probably temple guard thing or whatever you have there.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="89.76" data-end="94.08"> Jerusalem fine. Jesus doesn't have to be complicated. It's be like you're under arrest for being</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="94.08" data-end="98.84"> a blasphemer and blaspheming the temple. And you're going to have to come with us and we're</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="98.84" data-end="103.08"> going to put you on trial should be easy. But they didn't know what kind of reaction they</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="103.08" data-end="108.2"> were going to get out in public. They weren't sure how it was going to play and they're trying</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.2" data-end="112.32"> to protect their position. Like, okay, well, we can't do it in a way that could risk a</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.92" data-end="121.4"> no riots. And that's like the one threat we have the one card we can play to put pressure</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="121.4" data-end="126.52"> on them. We don't want to waste it on this thing when it wasn't a riot of our making.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="126.52" data-end="131.32"> Now I'm going to be clever with how we do this arrest. And that's why ultimately they</p>
