        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.32"> They have all these miracles that we're seeing in the book of Matthew were as pronounced and as public and as</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="5.44" data-end="9.96"> inspiring as they are held out as being in the text that how come more people weren't signing up?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="10.28" data-end="14.96"> That is the question we were wrestling with yesterday and today we are going to pick it up</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="15.48" data-end="20.52"> exactly where we left off after this catchy music that Jeff wrote and performed and puts in right here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="20.52" data-end="33.519999999999996"> A mat is the 10 minute Bible hour. Let's get after it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="33.519999999999996" data-end="39.2"> A minute ago I was saying that this question of how come not everybody is signing up in response to this amazing stuff of Jesus was pregnant</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="39.2" data-end="44.519999999999996"> in Matthew 12 and then we jumped forward to Matthew 13 and we got that parable of the sower and it's like oh he's speaking to that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="44.52" data-end="52.88"> But it's so pregnant that we can also bounce back one chapter and see that Jesus is addressing it there as well in a little different way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="52.88" data-end="58.720000000000006"> Remember Matthew 11 25 right before we get into these Sabbath controversies we're looking at now in Matthew 12.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="58.720000000000006" data-end="68.36"> At that time Jesus said, I praise you Father Lord of heaven and earth because you've hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="68.36" data-end="71.04"> Yes Father, for this was your good pleasure.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.04" data-end="90.04"> And so this means that we're getting what looks like on the surface at least a twofold answer from Jesus from the text as to why not everybody is signing up one because they're just not picking it they see it and these other factors come in that will explore more when we get to Matthew 13 and we actually look at the parable of the sower.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.04" data-end="103.84"> But then additionally you have the sovereign eternal all knowing all powerful providence God component where based on that language we just looked at from Matthew 11 25 and 26.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="103.84" data-end="108.04"> It is God who opens the eyes and shuts the eyes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.04" data-end="111.04"> It's God who reveals and withholds.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.04" data-end="123.04"> And if you have questions about that or find it troubling I think that's very reasonable and I would encourage you to go back and listen to the episode where we broke down Matthew 11 25 and 26 because obviously we had that question to and we broke it down.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.04" data-end="125.04"> So if you're not caught up going catch that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.04" data-end="139.04000000000002"> But in summary then you've got this really fair really natural question miraculous things are happening why aren't people signing up and then you're getting this two part answer that is anticipated by the text because people are how people are and because God is how God is.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="139.04" data-end="153.04"> Now there's a whole bunch of other things that you and I could kick around in terms of people are how people are you get the sunk cost fallacy which will be unpacking a lot more through the rest of the book of Matthew but this is the one where once you've put some energy and reputation</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="153.04" data-end="163.04"> and resources into a thing you will tend to chase that investment even when the investment goes sour or even when a different investment looks good.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.04" data-end="178.04"> So maybe what you got here is some very deep seated sunk cost fallacy on the part of people who actually witnessed these miracles firsthand but they're so invested in this other version of following God that it just doesn't matter if somebody can be raised from the dead.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="178.04" data-end="180.04"> They just can't go along with it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="180.04" data-end="182.04"> They are all in on this other thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="182.04" data-end="190.04"> On the human side I suppose you've got the devil you know mentality where you're like well you know someone goes on with our little religious shenanigans here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="190.04" data-end="201.04"> It's pretty shifty and I'm not crazy about all of it but I know the ground rules and I know how to make a little bit of lemonade out of these lemons and so I don't want a whole new set of ground rules.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="201.04" data-end="207.04"> I might end up in a worse place in the pecking order even though those miracles and stuff that I'm hearing rumors about sound really really cool.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="207.04" data-end="214.04"> I'm going to go with the devil I know instead of this new thing that brings unpredictable variables into an equation I'm pretty comfortable with.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="214.04" data-end="224.04"> And additionally when we try to figure out why these people saw these miracles and didn't sign up to follow Jesus and we consider their humanity and the foibles of being a human we might just think about sophistication.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="224.04" data-end="233.04"> It was a pretty sophisticated time in history with a relatively high literacy rate in this part of the world at this time compared to most of history.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="233.04" data-end="246.04"> But you know I didn't have electronic communication and didn't have access to all of the details maybe they couldn't point phones or cameras on these things and so maybe some of this was that the second hand audience.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="246.04" data-end="262.03999999999996"> Some were a little more skeptical some were more eager to believe and that just shook out in the same way that you get the kind of scully and mold or dynamic in the X files where some people are oriented toward belief and some people are oriented toward skepticism.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="262.04" data-end="279.04"> And maybe some of the second hand accounts just weren't enough to move the needle for some people I don't know we can probably come up with a hundred unqualified armchair 2000 years after the fact psychologist takes on why some people jumped in and why after seeing the exact same</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="279.04" data-end="296.04"> same data set some other people didn't jump in but probably the same thing right now lots of people are looking at the exact same data set considering the exact same texts considering the exact same anecdotal claims of people who've had</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="296.04" data-end="308.04"> a spiritual even if non miraculous encounter with God and they're like hey there's really something to this and surely whether you're a person of faith or not you got people in your life who've looked at the data and they're like nah I just don't think there's anything to it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="308.04" data-end="312.04"> I'm out and surely whether you're a religious person or not.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="312.04" data-end="316.04"> You've got people who would say I've looked at the data and I'm more than out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="316.04" data-end="317.04"> I'm angry.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="317.04" data-end="318.04"> Maybe you are that person.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="318.04" data-end="330.04"> If so thanks for hanging out by the way it's cool that you can see past us reading the data a little bit differently because you've also got whether you're religious or not people in your life like me who've read the data and like okay I still have questions.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="330.04" data-end="337.04"> But this efficiently passes my threshold of belief and I'm going to run down this road.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="337.04" data-end="338.04"> I'm in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="338.04" data-end="347.04"> I want to pick at it and I want to try to understand it better and I want to try to grasp the reality and character and actions and motivations of the God who's being able to do it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="347.04" data-end="348.04"> I'm in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="348.04" data-end="358.04"> And I think when we try to process through that question of how people today could look at the same data and come to different conclusions about God and Jesus and the whole thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="358.04" data-end="370.04"> We have to look at and consider the same answers that we have to look at and consider when we wonder why not everybody signed up 2000 years ago real simply because people are people were limited.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="370.04" data-end="384.04"> We've got all these things going on in our heads. We've got all these little systems and equations and narratives that we're running and that will cause us to sometimes look at the same data and come to different conclusions but also whether we're talking about back then or now we have to remember that there is a God character in this religion</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="384.04" data-end="395.04"> and behind these claims and that God character is going to be God and do God things which includes Providence even over possibly who sees it and who doesn't.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="395.04" data-end="400.04"> Though that may be a difficult thing for us to really understand and wrestle through.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="400.04" data-end="410.04"> Bottom line, it is the Bible not my skepticism that presents to us the question why are some people seeing all of this miraculous, amazing Jesus stuff and not believing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="410.04" data-end="424.04"> It is also the Bible not my creativity that gives us this very biblical, very from the mouth of Jesus himself to fold answer to that question, which again is because people are people and they're going to do people things and because God is God</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="424.04" data-end="426.04"> and he's going to do God things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="426.04" data-end="430.04"> So you're a smart, sophisticated podcast, Internet wise person.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="430.04" data-end="435.04"> You are paying attention to what we're doing here and you can tell that sometimes we do things that are very episodic.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="435.04" data-end="441.04"> We get to a little anecdote in the text and we're like, this happened, this happened, this happened, here the questions, boom, and we're on to the next thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="441.04" data-end="447.04"> You can also tell that at times I try to really slow us down because we're dealing with something that isn't episodic.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="447.04" data-end="453.04"> We're dealing with something that advances the plot, something that we really want to have thought through carefully</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="453.04" data-end="459.04"> so that we have this tool, this set of interpretive lenses for everything else that comes up down the road.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="459.04" data-end="460.04"> This is the latter.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="460.04" data-end="470.04"> We needed to wrestle this thing through together because that question is going to keep presenting itself to you and me, to the original audience, to the disciples who were there in the first place.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="470.04" data-end="474.04"> Tomorrow, we're getting back to something more episodic and really fun.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="474.04" data-end="482.04"> We're going to look at a handful of historical accounts about the relationship between the Jews and the Sabbath day that would have affected the world.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="482.04" data-end="489.04"> That would have affected how passionate the original audience and the religious leaders were about that topic.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="489.04" data-end="497.04"> And these episodes, historically, that we're going to look at involve bloodshed and war, very interesting material.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="497.04" data-end="499.04"> Thanks for taking a couple of days to game this out with me.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="499.04" data-end="502.04"> I like your brain. I like your sense of humor. I like your style.</p>
