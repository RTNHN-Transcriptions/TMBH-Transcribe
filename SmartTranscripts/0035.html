        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="6.08" data-end="9.24"> I promise that there is going to be no more Herod stuff, but there's a little more Herod</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="12.0" data-end="13.0"> So here's the deal.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="13.0" data-end="14.72"> We're in Matthew chapter two.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="14.72" data-end="19.68"> We're looking at Jesus and his family getting ready to come back from their time, hiding</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="19.68" data-end="24.400000000000002"> out in Egypt where it was probably really easy to blend in with that giant Jewish population.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="24.400000000000002" data-end="29.8"> You're beyond the reach of this murderous Herod jerk and then Herod the Great dies.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="29.8" data-end="32.92"> And now it's finally time to come home and picking it up in verse 19.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.92" data-end="36.92"> It says, after Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="36.92" data-end="41.120000000000005"> and said, get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel for those</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="43.8" data-end="45.2"> So all of that happens in a dream.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="45.2" data-end="48.92"> And once again, we know Joseph is very responsive to this kind of thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="48.92" data-end="53.24"> This is how God has communicated with him in the past and has been right every time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.24" data-end="58.32"> So Joseph, of course, is very faithful, gets up and does exactly what he's supposed to</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="58.32" data-end="63.24"> do. It says, so he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="63.24" data-end="68.16"> But when he heard that Arkelus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="68.16" data-end="69.92"> was afraid to go there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="69.92" data-end="73.36"> Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="74.92" data-end="76.08"> I don't know how many dreams that is.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="76.08" data-end="79.4"> It's going to be like what, five, six at this point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="79.4" data-end="85.12"> But it's interesting here that Joseph doesn't totally wait for the dream.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="104.16" data-end="107.84"> So it's kind of a cool partnering between common sense and the miraculous work of God</p>
