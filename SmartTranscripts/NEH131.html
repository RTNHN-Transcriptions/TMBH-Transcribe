        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="67.0" data-end="70.0"> And when I have extra time, I go and explore churches, because that's what I like to do.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="86.0" data-end="90.0"> So my wife and I drove down to Groton, Connecticut,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="95.0" data-end="99.0"> alright, there's probably not going to be much left here, just based on how remote this is.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.0" data-end="103.0"> And sure enough, there was no church left when I got there,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="103.0" data-end="108.0"> but the graveyard was still there, which is beautiful in a way,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.0" data-end="112.0"> but also overgrown and kind of spooky and kind of a sleepy hollow,</p>
