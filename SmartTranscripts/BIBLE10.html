        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now, we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="11.700000000000001"> We're covering one book each day, and this one's about second Samuel.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="22.400000000000002" data-end="26.6"> and that is, who's a lady with the pretty voice at the beginning of the thing?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="26.6" data-end="30.0"> And says stuff about this 10 Minute Bible Hour going to do the thing. Is that your wife?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="30.0" data-end="34.1"> Yep, that's my wife. That's Camilla. She did that, and I do think she has a lovely voice,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="34.1" data-end="37.300000000000004"> and I'm super grateful that she would grace my podcast with it.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="46.0" data-end="48.8"> you know, in the Bible, they call first and second Samuel,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="48.8" data-end="53.7"> but that really is just one season. It's just one book. It's just Samuel,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.7" data-end="58.900000000000006"> but it had to get split in two. And as we discussed yesterday, they split it at a really good place,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="87.89999999999999" data-end="94.8"> That would be problematic because Samuel, the other big character in this book, he anointed David,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="94.8" data-end="100.5"> God picked David, and David has done pretty much everything right in first Samuel.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="127.10000000000001" data-end="132.6"> where history is about to go coming out of this story. Well, as we suspected,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="132.6" data-end="138.6"> there is immediately resistance to the idea of David becoming king because we're talking about the Bible</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="138.6" data-end="144.29999999999998"> or any other time in history, those vacuums in power, they don't just sit there and almost never.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="144.29999999999998" data-end="150.6"> Does everybody see a scramble for power and then the guy in charge is dead and was like, guys, be calm.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="150.6" data-end="156.7"> I know lots of people have legitimate claims they feel to the throne, but let's just go with that guy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="156.7" data-end="163.2"> That would be right. It's not usually what you get there exceptions, but this is not going to be one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.2" data-end="171.7"> Saul's household and Saul's allies, they are going to rally around their people to try to keep the throne</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="171.7" data-end="178.5"> in some sort of dynasty. It's going to take a little cobbling together in the name of Saul and they're going to resist David.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="178.5" data-end="186.29999999999998"> And so very quickly, these sides start to take shape. But even as a civil war is looming and it's pretty obvious</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.4" data-end="218.6"> that would be my second biggest recommendation. If you're only going to read one thing from this book,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="528.0" data-end="533.0"> For the most part, David's made pretty good decisions, maybe a little erratic or inexplicable here or there,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="533.0" data-end="538.0"> but he's a man after God's own heart. And he's still a man after God's own heart after what happens next,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="538.0" data-end="545.0"> but it's a tough run for him and the people who he mistreats, including a woman named Bathsheba.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="545.0" data-end="551.0"> Caesar bathing on the roof, he lusts for her. The king gets what the king wants. She becomes pregnant.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="551.0" data-end="560.0"> And then David doubles down on his mistake by using some shoddy military tactics to make sure her very loyal, faithful husband,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="560.0" data-end="568.0"> Uriah, is killed in battle. What God through his prophet calls David on this. David to his credit immediately repents.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="568.0" data-end="575.0"> I mean, what else can you do at this point, but just own the mistake. And David has to endure painful consequences for what went wrong,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="575.0" data-end="584.0"> including painful consequences within his own household as his kids and his extended family start to do really stupid, destructive things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="584.0" data-end="591.0"> David's son, Amnon, falls in love with his step sister and takes advantage of her. I'm using euphemisms.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="591.0" data-end="600.0"> I understand that what he did was worse than takes advantage of. And then Tamar's full brother, Absalom, understandably once revenge.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="600.0" data-end="606.0"> And so he orchestrates the murder of Amnon. That's kind of a family incident at this point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="606.0" data-end="616.0"> And somehow that just opens Pandora's box and now Absalom goes into full on revolt and tries to overthrow and displace his father, David.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="616.0" data-end="624.0"> And in this ugly heartbreaking turn of events, David has to flee again. He's on the run. Surely he thought those days were behind him.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="624.0" data-end="633.0"> David struggles to mount a defense against his own son. Absalom manages to take control of Jerusalem and govern from there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="633.0" data-end="640.0"> But then Absalom, who must have had amazing hair, is killed in a very memorable scene in 2 Samuel 18 when he's riding a donkey.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="640.0" data-end="647.0"> But he rides it under some branches, like something out of the dukes, a hazard, instead of just getting knocked off his mule, his hair gets stuck in there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="647.0" data-end="666.0"> And that of course leaves him as a sitting duck for David's men and they kill him. Then through an ugly, drawn out, violent, up and down process, David is ultimately reestablished as king and reigns out through the rest of his days and is even able to pass on the throne to his son Solomon, who we're going to talk about more later on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="666.0" data-end="678.0"> But in all of that, we get kind of an odd season finale between chapters 21 and 24 of 2 Samuel, because we get a bunch of details here that seem to be out of order in terms of the timeline.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="678.0" data-end="688.0"> It seems like what the author of Samuel is going for here is to communicate the mixed baggiveness of this whole affair with David.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="688.0" data-end="697.0"> It's the Lord's anointed. He's a man after God's own heart. Every time he deviated from what God wanted him to do, he made absolute messes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="697.0" data-end="704.0"> And so what we see is both the beauty and the tragedy in the anecdotes included in these last few chapters.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="704.0" data-end="717.0"> We see again David's artistry on display and his heart for the Lord. And then the final anecdote is David falling into a place of sin once again where he counts on his own strength by taking a census.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="717.0" data-end="728.0"> God didn't want him to take and then realizes he was wrong and humbles himself before God again, but not until a very significant punishment has been leveled against all of Israel.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="728.0" data-end="746.0"> What we see coming out of the dramatic premium TV style season that is first and second Samuel is a clear promise that God is still in on the redemptive plan and an unconditional promise that no matter how much David messes things up, God is going to establish this eternal kingdom</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="746.0" data-end="756.0"> with this eternal king who's going to reign forever and descend from David. So we come away feeling the frailty of humanity and the inability of humanity to get things right on their own.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="756.0" data-end="763.0"> We come away with an answer to our question. Will kings solve everything coming out of the air of the judges? Nope, they will not.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="763.0" data-end="771.0"> But we can take hope in that God has promised that one day there will be a king and that king is going to straighten things out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="771.0" data-end="779.0"> We're all curious about when that king is going to show up and what it's going to look like and we'll move forward in the story more on that in First Kings next time around.</p>
