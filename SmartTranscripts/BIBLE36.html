        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.36" data-end="27.18"> I don't know the name, but I can describe it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="27.18" data-end="28.46"> Maybe you've seen it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.46" data-end="34.4"> It's the deal where you see somebody going down a hill way too fast on like a skateboard,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="34.4" data-end="39.7"> and things look good at first, but then you notice that they're starting to sway back and forth.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="61.06" data-end="64.86"> You can see the calamity coming from a really long ways away.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="79.66" data-end="81.3"> It's coming apart.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.17999999999999" data-end="122.26"> And Josiah has this encounter with the book of the law, and his heart is broken over what they've gotten wrong,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="122.26" data-end="131.06"> and he starts engaging in all of these reforms, and there's this moment at the very end of the several hundred-year run</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="135.54" data-end="144.3"> Like maybe they will defy the odds and be that one exception where the speed wobble starts, but they pull out of it somehow.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="144.3" data-end="145.38"> But then they don't.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.38" data-end="155.74"> Josiah dies in an ill-advised battle, and the stench of what is wrong with Judah and the whole southern kingdom is so systemic.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.74" data-end="160.74"> It's so worked into the fabric at this point that they just can't clean it up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="160.74" data-end="165.74"> They can't pull out of the speed wobble, even though everybody watching knows they're in speed wobble mode,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.74" data-end="170.18"> and even though they know we're in speed wobble mode, they can't fix it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="170.18" data-end="177.74"> Zephaniah is a guy who saw this coming from a very long ways away, and he was uniquely positioned to do so,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="177.74" data-end="181.34"> not just because he was a prophet, but he was royal blood.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.5" data-end="186.74"> This guy was the great-grandson of King Hezekiah.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="188.5" data-end="193.06"> But what that means is Zephaniah is different than any of these other prophets we've been seeing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="193.06" data-end="197.62"> He doesn't just know how to mingle in the court life and with the fancy people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="197.62" data-end="203.34"> He's one of them, which means he's giving up a tremendous amount, much like Josiah, to say,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="203.34" data-end="204.74"> this isn't going to work.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="204.74" data-end="207.94"> We need to admit the situation that we're in, and we need to repent.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="207.94" data-end="213.74"> But despite how unpopular that no doubt must have been in his circle of acquaintances,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.74" data-end="219.94"> he still said it, and he still called all of those fancy people and all of their fancy outfits</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="225.34" data-end="232.94"> And depending on when we understand this story that was recorded in the book of Zephaniah to have occurred,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="233.1" data-end="238.94"> it's possible that this is part of what inspired what went right during the reign of King Josiah.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="252.3" data-end="256.74"> But as we discussed in our conversation about the book of Nahum, it's not very long.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="497.06" data-end="500.22"> Now that is starting to come into focus all the more.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="500.54" data-end="503.58000000000004"> And the last bit of chapter three is just beautiful.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="503.58" data-end="514.74"> It's one of my favorite parts of all of the Old Testament prophetic books because we get this blissful picture of this utopia where God is dwelling among his people and they're all together.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="514.74" data-end="525.38"> And all the stupid broken stuff is gone kind of like Micah and Isaiah say about like the end of war and we're going to take our weapons of war and we're going to reshape them into things that are productive.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="525.7" data-end="542.5"> It's that kind of image, but we also get imagery like we get from Joel chapter two where there's that talk about God's spirit being among all the people who've come from all the corners of the world and God's spirit is among them like it used to live in the temple like it used to live in the tabernacle in the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="542.5" data-end="543.9399999999999"> Now it lives in people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="543.98" data-end="553.78"> Well, this is a degree of intimacy and closeness and unbroken fellowship with God that we've only seen very briefly at the very beginning all the way back in the garden.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="553.86" data-end="557.9399999999999"> And now we're getting these hints that we can look forward to that again someday in the future.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="557.98" data-end="559.06"> That's exciting.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="559.1" data-end="573.42"> And the further we get into the Old Testament and the more of these indictments from the prophets we see, the more we come to realize that is the only way forward is to be that close and that connected to God to the true King.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="573.54" data-end="582.78"> And so even though Zephaniah predicts what pretty much all the prophets are predicting whether they're predicting the fall of the north or prophesying to the south and predicting the fall of the south.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="583.02" data-end="584.74"> They're all saying there's a judgment coming.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="584.74" data-end="586.18"> It's gone on too long.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="586.18" data-end="589.98"> It's in the fabric that can't be sorted out easily.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="589.98" data-end="591.02"> There's no neat solution.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="591.02" data-end="592.6999999999999"> This is going to require judgment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="592.6999999999999" data-end="594.5"> We're too far into the speed wobble.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="594.78" data-end="595.74"> We're going to crash.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="595.74" data-end="596.9399999999999"> It's coming quickly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="597.38" data-end="600.62"> But the idea is that this judgment is not the end game.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="600.8199999999999" data-end="612.74"> The judgment is a necessary step in God remaking things to get us closer to the arrival of this King from the line of David who we've been hearing about in other books of the Old Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="612.78" data-end="623.06"> And closer to this new Eden, this new union with God where people from all the nations come together and experience this amazing thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="623.26" data-end="637.22"> When you visualize Zephaniah picture that speed wobble where the crash at the end is a foregone conclusion, when you think about the theme reflect on judgment of this moment to clear the way for a new and better one that is to come.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="637.3000000000001" data-end="642.74"> And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to catch chapter three versus eight through the end of it.</p>
