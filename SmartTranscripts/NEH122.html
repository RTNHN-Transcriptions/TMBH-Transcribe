        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="25.92"> There was a little grey box.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.92" data-end="32.92"> This little grey box played a remarkably informative role in the lives of people of my generation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.92" data-end="34.92"> Maybe that's not such a good thing. Maybe it is.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="34.92" data-end="38.92"> It was a little box that was complicated to use. It didn't always work.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="38.92" data-end="44.92"> You had to find ways to connect it through little silver screws to the back of your primitive television.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="44.92" data-end="49.92"> And you had to blow in the cartridges to make the little grey box function.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="49.92" data-end="56.92"> The Nintendo Entertainment System was the happiest thing in the world for a certain generation of people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="56.92" data-end="66.92"> And the happiest game on that happiest thing in the world was the gold-clad original Legend of Zelda.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="66.92" data-end="69.92"> It was magic. I thought video games were pretty cool before that game.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="69.92" data-end="72.92"> But the first time I popped that cartridge in, my friend Adam's house,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="72.92" data-end="77.92"> and heard the music and saw the majestic waterfall in the title screen, I was hooked.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="77.92" data-end="82.92"> And as if that wasn't enough, then the game starts and there you are.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="82.92" data-end="85.92"> Just a little fella right there in the middle of the screen.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="85.92" data-end="91.92"> And all you got is a little wood-whacking stick, and you have to go explore the great wide world and it's full of monsters.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="91.92" data-end="96.92"> And I don't know if you're going to make it. And it's kind of a metaphor for childhood.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="96.92" data-end="100.92"> And going out into your own great wide world. Maybe that's why it resonated with us so much.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="100.92" data-end="106.92"> There are many adventures to have in the Legend of Zelda and not a lot of friends to help you along the way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="106.92" data-end="111.92"> But there's one area that I'm thinking of today that was particularly treacherous for adventurers.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.92" data-end="115.92"> It was an area called the Lost Woods. Are you intrigued?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.92" data-end="123.92"> They weren't greenwoods like the rest of the map. They were Auburnwoods like October when things are scary and spooky.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.92" data-end="131.92000000000002"> And many adventurers who wandered into the Lost Woods never found their way out because it seems that no matter which way you went through the Lost Woods,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="131.92" data-end="136.92"> you couldn't get anywhere. You just kept going in circles, thus the name of the Lost Woods.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.92" data-end="140.92"> On the screen, when you were in the Lost Woods, you could only go one of four directions.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.92" data-end="143.92"> Twelve o'clock, three o'clock, six o'clock, or nine o'clock.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="143.92" data-end="148.92"> And so of course, a sensible thing when you find yourself there is just pick a direction and power through.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="148.92" data-end="153.92"> Eventually you're going to get out. They can't be infinite woods. Can they? Well, they are.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="153.92" data-end="159.92"> Because you would go nine o'clock forever and eventually you'd realize that no video game could be this big.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="159.92" data-end="163.92"> There's one little cartridge. I'm back in the same place I started and not getting anywhere.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.92" data-end="167.92"> Then you try going up. Then you try going down. Same result.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="167.92" data-end="176.92"> And eventually in Nintendo Power magazine, they finally told all of us that if you went northwest, southwest, in exactly that pattern, you could get out of the Lost Woods.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="176.92" data-end="182.92"> But otherwise, again and again and again and again and again, just like that loop that we were talking about yesterday.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="182.92" data-end="197.92"> So whether you're talking about an 8-bit video game or movies or TV shows or books or anything, the oh no, we're right back where we started is the ultimate metaphor for you are totally lost and you were wasting time and you were spinning your wheels.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="197.92" data-end="211.92"> I guess that's also a metaphor for the same thing. And that's what we've been talking about as we've been looking at this prayer, this big collective prayer in Nehemiah chapter 9 that's happened in the fall of 444 BC that all of the descendants of Abraham who are here are unified together</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="211.92" data-end="226.92"> in repeating back to their leader Ezra the priest. We have been going in circles. And you and I have been breaking down the multiple little circles that they are acknowledging that they've gone through through their grand history, the history of the Old Testament,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="226.92" data-end="234.92"> particularly the book of Judges is the Lost Woods of the Old Testament where you just keep coming back to the same thing again and again and again.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="234.92" data-end="250.92"> But as we get to the end of this prayer, we discover that it's not just a bunch of little circles, but that all of these little circles inside this larger story add up to one bigger circle that contains many little circles.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.92" data-end="266.91999999999996"> And the big grand circle that we discover here at the end of this prayer is that the journey of the descendants of Abraham more or less started out in slavery under a global superpower with no land of their own only promises from God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="267.92" data-end="280.92"> And now after all of their wandering through the Lost Woods, they are right back to being under the yoke of a global superpower, finding their hope only in the promises of God for something else.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="280.92" data-end="286.92"> In this prayer, they're acknowledging this meandering around in the Lost Woods. It is our own dang fault.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="287.92" data-end="296.92"> Verse 32, this picks up right at the end of the summary of the era of the book of Judges, which is before the era of the kings and the kingdoms and all of that stuff.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="296.92" data-end="300.92"> Verse 32 takes us forward through history into this era of the kings and the kingdoms.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="300.92" data-end="306.92"> Now therefore, oh, our God, the great mighty and awesome God who keeps his covenant of love.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="307.92" data-end="321.92"> Don't let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes. The hardship that has come upon us upon our kings and leaders upon our priests and prophets upon our fathers and all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="321.92" data-end="326.92"> In all that's happened to us, you've been just. You've acted faithfully while we did wrong.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="326.92" data-end="335.92"> Our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our fathers did not follow your law. They did not pay attention to your commands or the warnings you gave them, even while they were in their kingdom.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="336.92" data-end="344.92"> Enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="344.92" data-end="348.92"> Okay, there's a couple quick things of note there before we get to the very end of this prayer.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="348.92" data-end="355.92"> Thing number one, what we're basically covering now is the next chapter in the history of the descendants of Abraham.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="355.92" data-end="361.92"> This is the era of the kings as accounted for in First and Second Samuel and First and Second Kings.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="361.92" data-end="370.92"> There is another source book that existed at this time that we know from other places that Ezra had access to called the Book of the Kings.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="370.92" data-end="377.92"> That's different than the First and Second Kings that you're reading from in your Bible. We don't have access to this book anymore.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="377.92" data-end="390.92"> But there's a whole bunch of data out there, careful, chronicle of all of this era of the United Kingdom and then the Divided Kingdom, as Israel in the North and Judah in the South.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="390.92" data-end="406.92"> And that whole chapter of their existence that runs from a little after 1000 BC up to the fall of the Northern Kingdom to Assyria in 732 BC, all of that era is being vaguely alluded to, but pretty quickly passed over.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="406.92" data-end="418.92"> We spend a lot of time on judges, not a lot of time on the United and Divided Kingdom. And then there at the end of verse 32, we're talking about the next chapter, which is from the end of the Northern Kingdom, 732.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="418.92" data-end="438.92"> Through the remainder of the Southern Kingdom, which is up until 586, that's the Babylonian conquest, and all the way up until now, which is 444 BC, basically four big reigns into the accumulated Persian era of the history of the Old Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="439.92" data-end="446.92"> So we moved pretty slowly over the few hundred years that are the judges. I mean, that was like five or six verses of recounting the wandering in the lost woods.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="446.92" data-end="460.92"> And now we've gone very quickly through the era of the kings. But in the midst of summarizing that era of the kings, I think it's interesting that we get really what might be the only petition or request of this entire prayer.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="460.92" data-end="473.92"> I don't think I even need to say might. I really think this is the only petition we've seen so far. Now, therefore, oh, our God, the great mighty and awesome God who keeps his covenant of love.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="473.92" data-end="487.92"> Do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes. Is that it? For this whole prayer, this whole prayer of repentance for wandering in the lost woods of history, for making all of these mistakes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="487.92" data-end="496.92"> There's really not much specific to that, is there? They're throwing themselves at the mercy of God. They're not saying, give us this or do this thing or defeat these enemies.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="496.92" data-end="511.92"> The prayer is simply remember. Just make something of this seemingly meaningless story. Please provide a fresh narrative. The narrative we're repeating back to you is dumb.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="512.9200000000001" data-end="540.9200000000001"> It's a sad narrative. It's a broken narrative implicit in this little request right here would seem to be. Would you please breathe meaning back into this disappointing cyclical narrative that has gone on and on on repeat for so many years, so many lives, so much blood, so many squandered opportunities? Would you please give new life and new meaning and new framing to this narrative by whatever you do next?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="540.92" data-end="550.92"> Now, that's a pretty significant paraphrase on my part. I understand that, but I don't think I'm wrong. I don't know if you see it different. Let me know. But to me, that's the way I would interpret this prayer.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="550.92" data-end="563.92"> They're saying, we don't know how you give this thing meaning. We don't know how you redeem this story. We don't know how you take the yuck off of this and put some kind of luster or significance on it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="563.92" data-end="570.92"> We don't know how you make this somehow worth it, but we're completely underneath. We're totally falling at your feet here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="570.92" data-end="582.92"> Whatever meaning needs to be made of this, make meaning of it. Whatever value can be wrong out of this for something beautiful or redemptive. Do it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="582.92" data-end="588.92"> You remember a while back, I was talking about that unsung theme in the book of Nehemiah, that theme of remember.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="588.92" data-end="595.92"> That seems to be a real point of emphasis here. It seems to be where these people were at. And not just the people, but the leaders as well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="595.92" data-end="604.92"> I mean, when it all is done, this is the final thing that Nehemiah says to God, remember me with favor. Oh, my God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="604.92" data-end="614.92"> That's the final verse of Nehemiah. It's this earnest, humbled, chastened sense of, look, we haven't got this thing right.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="614.92" data-end="620.92"> And it's true, we're acknowledging that now and we're apologizing now. But even now, we don't really know exactly what to do.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="620.92" data-end="633.92"> We're trying, but ultimately we're dependent on you and your long memory and your 10,000, 100,000 foot view to make something beautiful out of this mess that we've made.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="633.92" data-end="641.92"> To make some sort of cohesive narrative to our lost woods wandering, please do that thing that only you can do.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="641.92" data-end="650.92"> I think this is such a powerfully human moment that is so easy to connect with for me right now, for people right now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="650.92" data-end="658.92"> There's this sense of despair that is unlike any other sense of despair that we feel when it seems like we just wasted life.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="673.92" data-end="680.92"> That was a powerful line for me when I first heard that whatever song it was actually from it, obviously popped more than the song itself.</p>
