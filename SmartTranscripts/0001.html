        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="319.74" data-end="324.62"> But this was written by tons of authors and they didn't even write it all in the same language</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="349.1" data-end="352.98"> Now part of the reason we know it's challenging to interpret are those reasons that I just threw out</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="352.98" data-end="355.62"> I mean it's the nuts and bolts of it make it challenging to interpret right</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="355.74" data-end="362.5"> But part of the reason that we know intuitively that it's challenging to interpret is because we've all heard people do insane</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="386.66" data-end="394.42"> Complex to interpret because we know what good interpretation looks like even if we don't know what good Bible interpretation looks like</p>
