        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="20.0" data-end="26.0"> He got into Mr. Podcaster mode, and now he got a extra bang along, yeah, but so,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="26.0" data-end="34.0"> 10 minute Bible hour podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="34.0" data-end="38.0"> All right, we got a little bit of an inside baseball conversation that we're going to have here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="38.0" data-end="44.0"> And it occurs to me that even the term inside baseball is increasingly becoming inside baseball.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="44.0" data-end="50.0"> You know this term, right? It's an old term that means conversations about topics that are kind of narrow,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="50.0" data-end="54.0"> and unless you're in it, you might not know the jargon or the dance steps of a given topic,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="60.0" data-end="65.0"> in the United States and Canada. And if you're going like, oh, I'm here for just more of the Bible stuff,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="65.0" data-end="69.0"> I don't worry, this is all going to tie in to Nia Maya 10 here in just a minute.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="69.0" data-end="77.0"> Over the last few hundred years, a couple hundred years specifically, it seems like every Christian denomination in my country</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="81.0" data-end="90.0"> Now, some of these say liberal arts, but really they're more of Bible college that sort of teaches the specific theology</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.0" data-end="95.0"> of a given expression of Christianity, and those can be great. Not a good things come out of that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="95.0" data-end="99.0"> But then some other ones, when they say liberal arts college, what they mean is, you know,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.0" data-end="105.0"> like the academic traditions of your where you've got a whole bunch of different topics that you can go and study,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.0" data-end="110.0"> and you just, I mean, it's college, just whatever you think of as college, it's college, right?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="110.0" data-end="115.0"> And I went to one of those. My undergraduate experience happened at Trinity College,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.0" data-end="121.0"> or it became Trinity International University. I always thought that name was a little bit goofy, but whatever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="121.0" data-end="128.0"> Trinity was on the north shore of Chicago, so in the super ritzy northern suburbs,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="128.0" data-end="131.0"> basically the same place that Ferris Bueller was from.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="131.0" data-end="137.0"> And so it was kind of a wild experience to be there and be dirt, poor. I mean, nothing is a freshman in college.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="138.0" data-end="145.0"> And my neighbors are Mike Ditka and Michael Jordan and Scotty Pippen and Mr. T and Mandy Patinkin.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.0" data-end="149.0"> That's the guy who was hunting the six-fingered man in the Princess Bride.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="149.0" data-end="153.0"> And how do I know all these people live there? Because eventually I got a job at Pizza Hut</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="153.0" data-end="159.0"> and I delivered them all pizza. So just crazy being this little poor college student enclave in the middle</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="159.0" data-end="164.0"> of this really fancy, wealthy part of the world. But the experience was really good.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="164.0" data-end="169.0"> I think my professors were great and you could go there and you could study a whole variety of topics.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="169.0" data-end="175.0"> And I think they were all very good at the disciplines they taught, but also all of the faculty there really put a lot of emphasis</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.0" data-end="180.0"> on integrated thought, thinking Christianly about whatever subject you were looking at.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="180.0" data-end="184.0"> There was also a tremendous amount of emphasis on classical thought, which I think is good.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="184.0" data-end="189.0"> I think it breeds humility instead of imagining that we're the smartest generation ever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="189.0" data-end="196.0"> It breeds humility to spend a huge amount of your educational process reading the greatest minds of the past.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="196.0" data-end="201.0"> Because hopefully in doing so, if you're paying attention, I wish I'd paid attention better,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="201.0" data-end="206.0"> you're not just learning what they discovered and what they said, you're learning their thought processes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="206.0" data-end="213.0"> You're being trained to imitate the processes of the most successful, most effective thinkers and communicators</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.0" data-end="216.0"> and explorers of all time. So I believe in what I got.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="216.0" data-end="221.0"> It was cool and I met my wife on my first day in my first class, Honors Philosophy, and that's worked out really well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="221.0" data-end="229.0"> So that was pretty cool too. My school, like so many of these little liberal arts schools around the United States and Canada</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="229.0" data-end="236.0"> has a seminary attached to it and it is associated with a denomination, an expression of Christian faith.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="236.0" data-end="245.0"> In this case, it's associated with the Evangelical Free Church of America, which is like a Lutheran free church kind of thing</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="245.0" data-end="249.0"> where they split off from the state church of Norway and Sweden.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="249.0" data-end="254.0"> So those immigrants migrated to Missouri and to Minnesota. In the late 1800s, there was a big boom.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="254.0" data-end="259.0"> It's why the Minnesota Vikings are the Vikings because that's where everybody migrated from at that time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="259.0" data-end="265.0"> And they eventually became the Evangelical Free Church of America and Trinity eventually became their college.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="265.0" data-end="270.0"> Again, tons and tons of denominations have little schools with seminaries attached just like this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="270.0" data-end="282.0"> A seminary is where you go to get trained to either be a clergy person, a pastor, a priest, whatever, or to do academic Bible scholarship kind of stuff.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="282.0" data-end="288.0"> Well, here's a crazy thing. My college this year went away. It's gone.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="288.0" data-end="298.0"> I have a zombie alma mater. I get my transcripts, I guess. If I need them now from some other institution, it doesn't exist.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="298.0" data-end="304.0"> The campus, all of it, I went and looked at it. They were like tumbleweeds and stuff, maybe not literally, but almost.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="304.0" data-end="309.0"> It's pretty wild to see this place. It was formative for so many people go away.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="309.0" data-end="312.0"> And I think it's okay for me to use the adjective or adverb sadly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="312.0" data-end="317.0"> And when I talk about this, but sadly, the same thing is happening to a whole bunch of schools like this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="317.0" data-end="326.0"> Now, why? Okay, COVID maybe. I don't know. I forget that COVID was just this gigantic thing in other parts of the world</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="326.0" data-end="332.0"> because we didn't really do it in western South Dakota and things went really frankly pretty well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="332.0" data-end="343.0"> I'm trying not to offer political commentary there, but I kind of am offering the political commentary that I don't agree with the mediation approach that was taken by most of the world.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="343.0" data-end="350.0"> And I particularly don't agree that we were not allowed to even have a conversation about what would be the best way to help people and get through it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="350.0" data-end="357.0"> So yes, I guess that was a bit of political commentary, but I'm going to stop with that right now only to say, hey, people did what they did.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="357.0" data-end="371.0"> Different communities attacked it the way they attacked it, but there were pretty serious consequences for a whole lot of businesses and institutions in places that attacked it with more strict mitigation policies than the places that sort of just let the thing play out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="371.0" data-end="385.0"> But I think that's the cheap explanation. I think the bigger thing that is happening there is we just went through a crazy moment in the history of faith in the western world.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="385.0" data-end="390.0"> And what was this crazy moment? Well, I think it's a crisis of the Internet.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="390.0" data-end="399.0"> Somewhere around the year 2000 to 2005, you and I, if you're listening to this, you're probably old enough to have been alive for that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="399.0" data-end="415.0"> Maybe you're just a bit younger, but within easy, smooth living memory of you and I, one of the five or six great shifts in the history of thought in the history of the world just occurred.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="415.0" data-end="426.0"> The shockwaves are still running through us constantly. It feels like this is the new normal, but it's not this degree of dynamism and change and transformation is weird.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="426.0" data-end="432.0"> We all lived in relatively small little bubbles up until the early 2000s.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="432.0" data-end="436.0"> You might be like, well, yeah, what about magazines and TV and all of that stuff? Well, sure.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="436.0" data-end="449.0"> But even the age of mass broadcast media was only a couple of generations long. And even then, if you grew up in the 80s, 90s or even 2000s, you grew up where you grew up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="449.0" data-end="455.0"> You were defined by the people in your life, the people around you, your church, your school, your teams, whatever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="456.0" data-end="484.0"> But after the age of my space, and I would say my space, not Facebook, the world dramatically changed because we no longer found our identity in a local physical community, our values, our ideas, our knowledge, our entertainment was being shaped in little virtual enclaves with other actual human beings, but not with other actual human beings that we saw and interacted with in all the ways that make a community robust</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="484.0" data-end="493.0"> and functional. So some dysfunction got introduced because nobody on this planet knew how to do life and social existence in that way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="493.0" data-end="496.0"> I still don't think we know how to do it very well in that way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="496.0" data-end="507.0"> Also, there was a sudden deprivation of being with other people in the community and receiving the give and take and feedback and push back and correctives, the social formatives that you get.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="507.0" data-end="518.0"> But also our ideas all simultaneously got put to the test in a way that we were not ready for, particularly, and for the purposes of our conversation, religious ideas.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="518.0" data-end="524.0"> I mean, for just about everybody, if you got raised in the context of church, you got raised in one context.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2185.0" data-end="2207.0"> But you and I, my friends, just lived through a moment that serves as a cautionary example of what happens if there isn't a plan and agreed upon plan for how to provide for the training and establishment of pastors and priests and honorable spiritual leaders for the people in a society.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2207.0" data-end="2209.0"> It can dry up really quickly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2209.0" data-end="2218.0"> So my college closed, and that's a bummer. My seminary is still open. And then any other places I went to school, I mean, there's state schools. They're probably not going anywhere. And that's nice. I like those.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2218.0" data-end="2223.0"> Like I said, I met my wife. I learned a bunch of stuff. So I'm grateful for everything that happened there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2223.0" data-end="2238.0"> And I understand that times change and that circumstances change. And all of that helps me understand this little provision in the middle of this covenant renewal that is being proclaimed by the descendants of Abraham in Nehemiah chapter 10.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2238.0" data-end="2255.0"> All of this stuff I have lived through and talked about with you helps me way better understand why this provision is here in Nehemiah 10, 36, and why this provision to bring the firstborn son for some sort of worker responsibility around the temple was so needed</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2255.0" data-end="2271.0"> and so forward thinking. And the fact that Judaism in any form is still something that exists, I think can be traced directly to the forethought, the foresight and the commitment that was made here in 444 BC in Nehemiah chapter 10.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2271.0" data-end="2281.0"> That was a lot of stuff. I said a lot of things. I'm really grateful for you being willing to hang with me for an unusually long episode that took us in an unusual different direction.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2282.0" data-end="2288.0"> I hope it was fun. I do not intend to make a habit of it. We will be back to our regularly scheduled length of programming.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="2288.0" data-end="2295.0"> Mannana. All right, that is plenty for now. I'm Matt. This is 10 minute Bible and I'll apply this. Let's do this again soon.</p>
