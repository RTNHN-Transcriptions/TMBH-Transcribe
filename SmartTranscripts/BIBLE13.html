        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="3.6" data-end="8.16"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.16" data-end="11.44"> We're covering one book each day, and this one's about first chronicles.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="21.12" data-end="24.8"> about first chronicles today, but I got to tell you, this is the hardest one I've done</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="24.8" data-end="28.080000000000002"> so far, and it's hard for a couple of reasons.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.08" data-end="30.32"> Because this book was difficult for me to read.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="30.32" data-end="35.6"> I was humming, reading all the other books before I would record these episodes,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="35.6" data-end="37.12"> but it has not been a burden.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="37.12" data-end="39.12"> It's just been fun so far.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="42.879999999999995" data-end="46.56"> like the end of every single episode, but I am learning so much,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="47.2" data-end="50.72"> and I'm just having a blast with this until first chronicles.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="50.72" data-end="56.239999999999995"> First of all, it opens with nine straight chapters of genealogy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="56.24" data-end="60.480000000000004"> And look, I've read the Bible and I've thought about this stuff a little bit,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="60.480000000000004" data-end="65.44"> and I understand the genealogies are there for a reason, and I even feel comfortable</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="65.44" data-end="69.28"> talking about why they're there, but that doesn't change the fact that it is hard</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="69.28" data-end="73.52000000000001"> to sit down and just read through those names, most of which I can't pronounce.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="74.24000000000001" data-end="79.6"> And I should probably know a lot more of them, but I don't because I forget things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="79.6" data-end="82.80000000000001"> And so it's just a lot of unfamiliar material there.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="85.52" data-end="86.24"> Good. All right.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="86.24" data-end="90.16"> Now let's move forward, but you don't move forward in first and second chronicles.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.16" data-end="95.84"> What you get is a gigantic recap of stuff that you already looked at.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="95.84" data-end="100.32"> And so it's the first time in the Bible, other than the little aside that is Ruth,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="100.32" data-end="103.6"> but even Ruth still feels like you're moving ahead chronologically.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="103.6" data-end="106.56"> It's the first time as you're doing a trip straight through the Bible,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="106.56" data-end="110.08"> where stuff is not happening in order anymore.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="110.08" data-end="113.36"> And just straight up, that can be kind of discouraging.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.36" data-end="117.52"> And so I guess what I'm trying to say is on the one hand, if you ever tried to read through</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="117.52" data-end="121.2"> the Bible and first and second chronicles were difficult, hey, I feel you.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="131.44" data-end="132.4"> It's hard.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="135.28" data-end="138.88"> Thankfully, you'll never have to hear the wreckage of all of the other tries.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.51999999999998" data-end="157.68"> until this trip through.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="171.36" data-end="177.12"> Usually, I find those to be helpful, but I'm in a hurry to get it over with.</p>
