        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="176.8" data-end="193.12"> This whole thing, dating back to Darius and even Cyrus has been a half the century long experiment in what if we all set aside our differences ethnically and came together and made one great people group and fought together and made money.</p>
