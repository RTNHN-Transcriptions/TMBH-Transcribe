        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="18.0" data-end="19.92"> In fact, no, let me just rephrase that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="19.92" data-end="20.92"> I'm going to throw that to you as a question.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="20.92" data-end="22.92"> Who do you think wrote the book of Matthew?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="22.92" data-end="26.52"> It feels like I'm doing the Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb routine here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="26.52" data-end="32.32"> But the difference is that I think Grant's tomb probably says Ulysses S. Grant on it,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.32" data-end="35.68"> whereas Matthew doesn't actually say Matthew's name on it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="35.68" data-end="39.2"> It seems like it does because in our Bibles, his name is all over it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="39.2" data-end="41.4"> And really the Gospels all work the same way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="41.4" data-end="43.6"> They say Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="43.6" data-end="49.6"> But none of those authors actually acknowledge themselves within the text as being the authors</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.96" data-end="59.96"> Now, John of the four, I think, most tips his hand that he's the guy who wrote it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="59.96" data-end="63.96"> There's a bunch of hints that we're not going to get into in this conversation about that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="63.96" data-end="68.64"> Luke, if you extrapolate that out and look at the whole body of his work, Luke and Acts,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="68.64" data-end="73.92"> I think there's some pronoun usage in Acts that indicate that Luke was with the traveling</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="73.92" data-end="74.92"> party at times.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="74.92" data-end="78.28"> And you can kind of piece that together to do the math to figure out that there's some</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.28" data-end="81.56"> internal evidence of Luke as being the author of Luke and Acts.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.56" data-end="90.32000000000001"> And some people point to his phrasing on the account of the rich young ruler being different</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="94.0" data-end="98.2"> And they suggest that maybe Mark was tipping his hand that he was the rich young ruler.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="98.2" data-end="100.12"> You can see with all of this, it's thin.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="100.12" data-end="105.84"> We're obviously relying on some other external evidence for who we credit these books to.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.84" data-end="106.84"> And Matthew is no different.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="106.84" data-end="113.0"> In fact, I would say Matthew has the fewest hints as to its own authorship, at least in</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.0" data-end="115.36"> terms of a smoking gun.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.36" data-end="119.52"> Matthew talks about himself, as we discussed in our last conversation, in Matthew chapter</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.52" data-end="123.92"> nine with that very brief account of his conversion.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.92" data-end="125.24"> And that's kind of all you get.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.24" data-end="130.96"> Now, that isn't to say that there's no evidence within Matthew of Matthew's authorship though,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="130.96" data-end="137.36"> because Matthew is a book that is very clearly written to a strongly Jewish audience that</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="137.36" data-end="141.92000000000002"> is trying to make the connection between all of the stuff that happened and what Christians</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="141.92" data-end="145.72"> would call the Old Testament, what Jews would call the Hebrew scriptures.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.72" data-end="150.83999999999997"> And so we've got somebody who's really dialed into that world and that would fit with some</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="150.83999999999997" data-end="153.04"> things that we know about Matthew.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="153.04" data-end="157.2"> But even there, that isn't totally compelling evidence because that could also be made to</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="169.08" data-end="173.56"> We'll talk about this in a future conversation, but Matthew is built around five really pretty</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="180.84" data-end="185.68"> someone who dealt in records that he might have been able to shorthand the words of Jesus</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="185.68" data-end="189.32000000000002"> or that he would have been documenting and taking notes because that was just how he</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="189.32000000000002" data-end="192.24"> would have had to have thought about the world.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="192.24" data-end="196.64000000000001"> And it's what he would have brought with him from his old life in terms of how he approached</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="200.11999999999998" data-end="206.44"> So the stronger rationale for why we think Matthew wrote Matthew is simply the historical</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="207.64" data-end="215.56"> And I guess the most glaring thing to me is that there is no, literally no, rival tradition</p>
