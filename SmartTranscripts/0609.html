        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.64" data-end="15.0"> at the beginning of Matthew chapter 25 as crazy. Like sometimes, you know how they say you get like</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="23.36" data-end="28.44"> so much illusion to other things from around the Bible that have been waiting for payoff</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.44" data-end="33.36"> and it's all just tucked into like the first sentence or sentence and a half of Matthew 25.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="33.56" data-end="35.800000000000004"> So yeah, we are lingering here a little bit</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="35.800000000000004" data-end="42.08"> but we're doing it for a reason and I think that what we're gonna find is that as we do this background work on this parable of the</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="42.08" data-end="49.08"> 10 bridesmaids or 10 virgins, what we're gonna discover is that this whole parable just neatly falls into place once we've got that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="49.08" data-end="54.28"> And I think it is a very important payoff. So we're gonna keep working on that. If you didn't listen to yesterday's episode</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="54.28" data-end="60.2"> you're gonna want it because it's gonna make all of this go and Jeff's got a little thing that he does in the music and then we're right back into it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="69.96000000000001" data-end="80.28"> Jose is the smoking gun, right? That's a part of the Old Testament that most obviously comes to mind in terms of this imagery of God as husband to his people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="80.28" data-end="93.44"> But there is more Jeremiah 31 and this one I did have to look up and write down because I never would have remembered it was Jeremiah 31 and I did</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="93.44" data-end="99.56"> write down the verse. It is verse 32. Here we go. It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers. Oh, I know this one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.56" data-end="105.96000000000001"> Oh, I know this one. I should have looked it up first when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt because they broke my covenant though I was a</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.96" data-end="113.72"> husband to them. I'm super famous. I'm leaving this in there though. I'm not gonna hide my shame that I totally forgot where that was because guess what?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="114.19999999999999" data-end="121.88"> Nobody knows all the things about the Bible and through the power of editing we could easily give the false impression that one does know all the things about the Bible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="122.16" data-end="126.44"> It's a really big book and that's a really, really famous verse that illustrates this point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="127.11999999999999" data-end="133.32"> Maybe as famously as what I just pointed you to in Jose. Oh, well, whatever. I am humbled as always. I think you're getting the point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="133.32" data-end="143.44"> There's at least two more that I found reference that other people had pulled together and doing research on the same thing regarding this use of husband imagery in the Old Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="143.56" data-end="158.76"> What I'm driving at with all of this is that Jesus isn't coming out of left field here at the beginning of Matthew chapter 25 and being like, what if God's relationship with people was like, I don't know a bridegroom and a bride roll with me on that one for a minute.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="158.76" data-end="170.23999999999998"> Rather, he's drawing on imagery that has already been deeply internalized by his audience, that has already been deeply internalized by the disciples because of their upbringing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="170.23999999999998" data-end="181.07999999999998"> And in a way, Jesus' use of this imagery is rearranging, redefining, maybe even clarifying what his relationship with his disciples is like.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.08" data-end="192.60000000000002"> And for those who read through the Gospels and they see the 12 disciples somehow being, I want to be careful here in terms of how I framed this and I don't know butchered the theology of it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="192.60000000000002" data-end="199.0"> An evolution or completion or some symmetry with those 12 disciples with the 12 tribes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="199.0" data-end="211.0"> And maybe not that they necessarily like become Israel or speak for all of Israel, but that there's some kind of correlation there and that a bunch of the aspects of the relationship between God and his chosen people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="211.0" data-end="223.36"> So carry over somehow present in the relationship between God and his disciples and the people who they're going to talk to about the message of the kingdom and who will sign up because of what those disciples do and say.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="223.36" data-end="226.32"> I think that's present. It can't be overlooked.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="226.32" data-end="234.2"> Although I think if we're just looking at Matthew chapter 25 to try to make sense of what role do the disciples play and how does that relate to Israel?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="234.2" data-end="239.88"> I'm not sure we have quite enough here in this passage to nail that down in a satisfactory way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="239.88" data-end="249.4"> I think I warned you up front yesterday. There's going to have to be a double episode because there's a lot of Bible that we got to bounce around to here and making sense of the front end of this parable of the 10 versions or the 10 bridesmaids.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="249.4" data-end="257.84"> And this other stuff that I want to poke around at is stuff that's hinted at or alluded to also right here in the book of Matthew in the New Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="257.84" data-end="268.28"> And the first thing that I think bears mentioning is just one more reminder that chapter 25 is definitely a continuation of the thoughts in chapter 24 because you remember back in 24 when Jesus was like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="268.28" data-end="272.67999999999995"> all right, you got what you need to know about when the son of man is going to come back.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="272.67999999999995" data-end="275.67999999999995"> I might be like some little delays or wrinkles in there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="275.67999999999995" data-end="278.96"> But basically you can tell when it's getting close because of how fig trees are.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="278.96" data-end="284.23999999999995"> And then in verse 37 of Matthew 24, so about two paragraphs behind where we are right now,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="284.23999999999995" data-end="288.64"> you recall he says, as it was in the days of Noah, so it'll be at the coming of the son of man.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="288.64" data-end="291.03999999999996"> For in the days before the flood, remember this part?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="291.03999999999996" data-end="297.44"> People were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="297.44" data-end="301.71999999999997"> I think Jesus is introducing this imagery in 24 37 and 38.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="301.71999999999997" data-end="306.32"> And then he's coming right back to this imagery at the beginning of chapter 25 with this parable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="306.32" data-end="309.56"> We're looking at right now is pretty obviously about wedding stuff.</p>
