        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="7.36"> We're trying to make sense of the different historical reads among Christians on this pivotal passage in Matthew 26</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.08" data-end="15.52"> versus 26, 27, and 28. It's Jesus initiating the Lord's Supper like the thing that all Christians do.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="15.52" data-end="22.16"> And I think all Christians agree that it points to Jesus' saving work on the cross and what he did to defeat death</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="22.240000000000002" data-end="28.400000000000002"> and that it all points to the culminating moment in God's redemptive plan, but the exact specifics of that,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.4" data-end="35.6"> including whether or not to take Jesus' words about the bread becoming his body and the cup being his blood completely literally,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="36.48" data-end="40.16"> well, that just takes a little bit longer to sort through and that's what we're working on right now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="40.16" data-end="48.879999999999995"> As we take a quick flyover look at the Catholic Anglican Orthodox Eucharistic, I guess they call it transsubstantinist position.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="48.88" data-end="60.88"> I'm going to have Jeff play some music and we'll keep chipping away at it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="60.88" data-end="65.68"> The Catholic position as best as I understand it. I've never been Catholic. I'm not a Catholic now. I like Catholics.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="65.68" data-end="68.88"> I'm doing my best to speak for somebody else.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="68.88" data-end="77.44"> The Catholic position as best as I can tell is that once that priestly prayer with apostolic authority descended from Peter,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="77.44" data-end="85.75999999999999"> descended from Jesus is prayed over the elements that a transformation occurs at the level of the substance and the transformation is complete.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="86.72" data-end="99.75999999999999"> Now, this is where it's a little bit confusing for me. I've heard of what is called Eucharistic miracles where certain Catholics claim that even the outwardly perceptible elements of communion,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.76" data-end="108.80000000000001"> the bread and the wine under a microscope transformed or something into blood or like actual flesh.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.80000000000001" data-end="119.12"> I'm not persuaded by these. I've investigated these claims. I don't find them compelling. I understand that is very offensive to people who do find them compelling.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.12" data-end="128.72"> And on that, I would just ask for your grace and patience. One can only believe what they actually believe and can only be truthful with themselves as they read the evidence.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="128.72" data-end="132.16"> And we're just going to have to respect each other on that one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="132.16" data-end="142.32"> So acknowledging that there are these outlier claims that maybe every now and then the transformation is so complete that it becomes like actual scientifically investgatable blood,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="142.32" data-end="152.32"> like a plague of the river Nile turning into blood kind of transformation from one fluid to another or the bread turning into flesh, acknowledging that there are those outlier claims.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.32" data-end="162.32"> In a usual Catholic mass, the transformation that occurs would not be externally observable. And Catholics would not try to argue that it is externally observable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="162.32" data-end="175.68"> But rather at this philosophical or risk to teal in level of what they would call the substance, which is a whole bunch of defining characteristics all the way down to the essence of the thing, even though outwardly it might look like something else.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.68" data-end="188.56"> The transformation occurs and that after that prayer has happened, the people who take the Eucharist in that mass are actually consuming the actual blood and actual body of Christ.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="188.56" data-end="196.32"> And though a Catholic would be quick to say, we do not repeat the sacrifice of Christ. We're not crucifying him again and again and again with this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="196.32" data-end="213.32"> There is still some degree of language about, I don't want to just say again, a repetition of the sacrifice. I don't understand the exact nuance, but I know that most Catholics would bulk at the language of repeating the sacrifice of Christ again and again.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.32" data-end="234.32"> But rather, it's more like participating in it that happened once and for all and that echoes outside the normal linear idea of time as we think of it. So the person who is a Catholic and takes the Eucharist is participating outside of time in a thing that happened once at the cross.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="234.32" data-end="240.32"> If that's not the best way to put it, I'll just have to ask for your grace on that. That's my best run at it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="240.32" data-end="253.32"> A lot of this language about the Catholic understanding of the Eucharist is outlined at the Council of Trent. The Council of Trent was a gathering that Catholics had in response to the Reformation that got cooking in 1517.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="253.32" data-end="266.32"> Well, it got cooking before that, but most famously with the works of Martin Luther in 1517 and moving forward. So in the mid 1500s, the Council of Trent is sort of the counter Reformation move.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="266.32" data-end="276.32"> A bunch of reforms occur and a bunch of clarifications that are also issued in response to the pressure placed on Catholicism by the Protestant reformers.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="276.32" data-end="283.32"> Because of that, at Trent, the Catholic Church clarifies its position on communion on the Eucharist.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="283.32" data-end="295.32"> And I think the most useful basic summary of that position as articulated at the Council of Trent can be found in the Catholic Catechism, which is a series of teachings that churches use to explain the faith to new initiates or kids come to the church.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="295.32" data-end="309.32"> And that reads, the Council of Trent summarizes the Catholic faith by declaring, because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his body and that he was offering under the species of bread.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="309.32" data-end="323.32"> I'll have to talk about that word species another time. It has always been the conviction of the Church of God and this Holy Council now declares again that by the consecration of the bread and wine, that's that prayer I was talking about, there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="323.32" data-end="329.32"> and the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="329.32" data-end="335.32"> This change, the Holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called transubstantiation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="335.32" data-end="348.32"> That same Council of Trent makes it clear that this is the exclusive position of Catholicism, calling anybody who would refute or push back on that transubstantiation or describe what happens with the elements differently.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="348.32" data-end="358.32"> It says very specifically, let him be anathema or the words excommunicated, not a part of the church. That just doesn't work. It just doesn't fit with Catholic theology.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="358.32" data-end="367.32"> Again, Anglicanism and Orthodoxy are a little different animal, but all three would agree that there's a transformation that occurs.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="367.32" data-end="378.32"> All three would assert that this has been the exclusive position of the Church from the beginning of the establishment of Christianity with very few exceptions up until the Protestant Reformation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="378.32" data-end="387.32"> I think history tells a little different story, but that that would be the position and therefore the literalist position.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="387.32" data-end="395.32"> They look at this passage and just to sum it up and put a bow on it, they would say quite literally when Jesus says, take and eat, this is my body.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="395.32" data-end="404.32"> Quite literally when he says, drink this, all of you, this is my blood. He means this is my blood. How would everyone be able to participate in that?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="404.32" data-end="419.32"> Well, you would need some kind of spiritual metaphysical mechanism by which the gift of the literal body and literal blood of Christ could be transferred to people across the ages so they could participate in this supper.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="419.32" data-end="429.32"> And as we talked about, there are some structures that make that work. If you are Catholic, if I was even close to describing that right, you're probably like, yeah, that's it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="429.32" data-end="435.32"> I don't know why wouldn't everybody just see it that way. If you're not Catholic, you're probably like, that doesn't make any sense to me at all.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="435.32" data-end="446.32"> But my goal with this podcast is not to sort out who ultimately and finally does Christianity the right way because I know so very, very much the goal is just try to understand what the text says.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="446.32" data-end="460.32"> And this is one of those places where this particular question, literal or figurative cast such a long shadow that I think it affects our ability to read the text objectively and inhibits our ability to say, oh, well, the text is clearly literal here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="460.32" data-end="474.32"> Oh, the text is clearly figurative here. Oh, the text is clearly ambiguous here. And so sometimes, all the way back to that opening point, you got to speak to the elephant in the room to put ourselves in a good position to read it for what it is and to be in a place where we can move ahead</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="474.32" data-end="487.32"> with cohesiveness and peace. There's the quick overview version of the very literal read of this passage. We're going to look at the more figurative read on this passage next time around.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="487.32" data-end="496.32"> Thanks for being cool about this. It's not a conversation that most internet communities can have and yet we can. So you're awesome. Thanks for being that way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="496.32" data-end="513.3199999999999"> I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.</p>
