        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="44.8" data-end="51.28"> I don't know who these things are for, but they're like the kind of thing you would buy in a Christian bookstore in 1991.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="51.28" data-end="54.72"> It's supposed to be cherished or something. They're called snow babies.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.88" data-end="92.32"> Wait. I forgot about the snow baby. Likewise, it's really easy to forget that Habakkik is a real testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="92.32" data-end="94.88"> Why do you listen to this program? It's terrible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="94.88" data-end="103.44"> We're in the book of Galatians and we're in the part where Paul is rounding out of the super angry corrective tone that he's taking.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="103.44" data-end="106.96"> And into more of the lightly angry corrective tone.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="106.96" data-end="114.96"> But now he's into making his case. He's cleared up some mistruths, some gossip that has been spoken.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="114.96" data-end="123.96"> He's put the data, the timeline back in front of this church in Galatia to be like, Hey, guys, some people came into your church and tried to cause problems here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.96" data-end="136.35999999999999"> And you fell for it. But if you really actually think about the facts, both of our relationship and of what God has done in your life and of the Bible and of logic, you'll see these people are fully crap and they're just making stuff up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.36" data-end="143.08"> Then causing problems for no reason. And you will be able to figure out that you should ignore them and why you should ignore them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="143.08" data-end="149.76000000000002"> So we're past the part where Paul is hitting them with the shock and awe campaign of like, Yeah, you guys are. I can't believe how quickly you got this wrong.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="149.76000000000002" data-end="152.56"> What is the matter with you? You're wrong about all these things. We're past that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="153.20000000000002" data-end="166.32000000000002"> And now we're into the part where he in a fatherly way is giving them language that they can use internally in their own brains amongst themselves as a congregation and externally to defeat these.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="166.32" data-end="175.72"> Bad ideas and not just to move forward believing in the true gospel message because Paul said so, but believing in it because they actually believe it and they've actually thought it through.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.72" data-end="180.64"> And you and I are the beneficiaries of this process because this letter is timeless.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="180.64" data-end="193.0"> This speaks to questions that are going to come up in most churches eventually questions that are going to come up in most Christian traditions eventually questions that are going to come up over the course of a lifetime of faith eventually.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="193.24" data-end="199.28"> And so we're getting into some of the most deep water important theology of the New Testament here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="199.64" data-end="208.76"> But again, Paul isn't just making this up out of thin air and being like, believe me, because I'm very popular right now and believe me because I'm speaking the loudest and most recently right now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="209.24" data-end="222.96"> No, he's drawing on a ton of reason and particularly drawing on a ton of Bible to spell out what the true gospel is to remind the Galatians of what they believed in the first place and to remind them that the law.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="223.52" data-end="227.92"> The Old Testament was never a tool meant to save.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="228.16" data-end="247.68"> The thing wasn't built by God or designed by God to make a person have right standing before God or to resolve a person's sinful nature once and for all rather right standing before God only is achieved by receiving the gift of God by believing what you heard as the language Paul uses.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="248.20000000000002" data-end="256.08"> So he just got done quoting Deuteronomy 27 26, cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="256.48" data-end="263.28000000000003"> He's drawing from a text in the law to say that the law itself says this isn't going to work.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="264.08" data-end="271.88"> The very law the agitators have been appealing to destroys the case the agitators are making.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="272.08" data-end="278.96"> But now Paul is going to flip it around to something from the Old Testament that is proactive that is positive.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="278.96" data-end="281.36"> Here's the constructive counter proposal.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="281.68" data-end="285.44"> He says clearly no one is justified before God by the law.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="285.64" data-end="286.88"> You have to keep the whole thing.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="301.12" data-end="303.08"> So let's just get back to the Old Testament.</p>
