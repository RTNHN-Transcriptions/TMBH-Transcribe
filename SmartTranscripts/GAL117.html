        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="127.0" data-end="129.0"> Using it comes at a cost.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.0" data-end="134.0"> Somebody used it for great evil in one of the earlier Avengers movies.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="135.0" data-end="140.0"> Well, the Avengers, they get their mitts on this thing eventually and they got to try to undo it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.0" data-end="145.0"> They got to use the power of the glove and the magic rocks that are in there to undo this great evil.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.0" data-end="149.0"> But there's so much power involved that they're all looking around.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="149.0" data-end="153.0"> They're like, well, who's going to actually put the glove on and do the thing?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="153.0" data-end="155.0"> Because it's going to hurt a lot.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.0" data-end="158.0"> You're going to have to absorb all of this pain.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="158.0" data-end="161.0"> And it comes down to the Hulk because the Hulk is big and he's powerful.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.0" data-end="165.0"> And even if you don't know stuff about comic books, you've heard of the Hulk, giant green guy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.0" data-end="174.0"> And so he's the one who feels like he can take it and he pays a great price to do that thing to absorb that curse, if you will.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="174.0" data-end="186.0"> And the whole motif in storytelling, especially sci-fi and comic book storytelling, of absorbing a curse is something that we could probably think of 50 examples of, where there's a thing,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="186.0" data-end="189.0"> there's a great power, maybe a great evil.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="189.0" data-end="195.0"> There's some thing that just has to be purged, but it can't just go out into nowhere.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="195.0" data-end="197.0"> It's like electricity almost.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="197.0" data-end="199.0"> It's like it's got to be grounded.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="199.0" data-end="207.0"> It's got to go into something to be filtered, to be absorbed because it can't just linger.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="207.0" data-end="210.0"> It has to be consumed.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="210.0" data-end="218.0"> Well, in a sense, every time you see that motif play out in sci-fi or comic book storytelling, it's all a nod back to Jesus.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="218.0" data-end="220.0"> It's all a nod back to the big story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="220.0" data-end="224.0"> And this isn't me reading that in and being like, oh, because Jesus is like a comic book here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="224.0" data-end="226.0"> No, it's because it's right here in Galatians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="226.0" data-end="227.0"> It's all over the Bible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="227.0" data-end="237.0"> The idea that Christ absorbed, consumed, drank, took upon himself this curse that couldn't just linger out there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="237.0" data-end="239.0"> It had to go somewhere.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="239.0" data-end="242.0"> The curse had to do its curse thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="242.0" data-end="243.0"> That was inevitable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="243.0" data-end="250.0"> And if the curse thing had been allowed to play out naturally and affect everyone to whom it was directed,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="250.0" data-end="252.0"> it would have been catastrophic for everyone.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="252.0" data-end="257.0"> But instead enter Jesus, the one guy who stretching the metaphor here is the Hulk.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="257.0" data-end="260.0"> He has what it takes to endure that thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="260.0" data-end="266.0"> Well, ultimately Jesus dies a literal death on the cross in the process of absorbing that curse.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="266.0" data-end="269.0"> But he's raised back to life on the third day.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="269.0" data-end="271.0"> Curse is absorbed.</p>
