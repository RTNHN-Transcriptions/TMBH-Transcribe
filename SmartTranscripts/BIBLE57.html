        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="11.700000000000001"> We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Philemon.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="18.400000000000002" data-end="27.2"> The Book of Philemon is a letter written by the apostle Paul to a Christian leader in the Church of Colossae named Philemon.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="27.2" data-end="32.9"> And if you recall back to when we did our conversation about the Book of Colossians,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.9" data-end="37.5"> the Paul didn't really know anybody in that church or almost nobody in that church.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="37.5" data-end="41.0"> He didn't found the church, he hadn't been there yet,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="41.0" data-end="46.0"> and he wrote that letter to the Colossians from one of his many prisons days</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="46.0" data-end="50.0"> and was hoping to get to go and visit them sometime later when he got out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="50.0" data-end="53.9"> He was aware of some of the problems and the challenges in that church</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.9" data-end="60.8"> and he was particularly interested in having them reimagine how they do their households there</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="60.8" data-end="65.7"> in light of the truth of the new family of faith and the equalizing effect</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="65.7" data-end="69.3"> that the work of Christ has in making this new family of faith</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="69.3" data-end="75.3"> where everybody, regardless of your gender, your race, or your ethnicity,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="75.3" data-end="82.1"> or even your social status, even slave or free according to Paul in Colossians 3 verse 11,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="82.1" data-end="87.39999999999999"> reimagine all of that because you're all equal in Christ as members of this new family,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="87.39999999999999" data-end="91.3"> as sons, daughters, children, heirs, agents of the king</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="91.3" data-end="93.5"> because of the glorious work of Christ.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="93.5" data-end="97.3"> It's pretty awesome and it's wildly forward thinking.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="97.3" data-end="102.8"> It's also the kind of thing that just begs for a test case to figure out if anybody actually means it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="102.8" data-end="106.1"> Because if you take that to its logical conclusions,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="106.5" data-end="113.0"> it would require Christians to act in some ways that are very weird and very countercultural.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.0" data-end="119.6"> And that is exactly what we get in the scenario surrounding this book of Philemon</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.6" data-end="122.3"> and the content of the letter there in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="122.3" data-end="128.9"> Philemon, the recipient of this letter, is a wealthy leader in the church at Colossae</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="128.9" data-end="131.5"> and Paul seems to hold him in high regard.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="131.5" data-end="136.4"> My guess would be that Philemon became a Christian because of that Ephesus effect</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.4" data-end="137.6"> we've talked about before.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="137.6" data-end="143.1"> Remember Paul said that what happened in Ephesus among the Christians had a ripple effect.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="143.1" data-end="148.8"> It affected the whole greater Ephesus region and it looks like Colossae is a byproduct of that</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="148.8" data-end="153.2"> being founded by Apaphris, who we talked about before, and Philemon.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="153.2" data-end="158.7"> Well, everybody in the Roman world had servants and slaves in their household.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="158.7" data-end="165.39999999999998"> Now this is not the ethnic slavery of the British colonial world and the American south.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.39999999999998" data-end="171.1"> This is a social slavery and it's a different flavor, but it is still not good</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="171.1" data-end="175.7"> and it's not the status one would want to find themselves in at the same time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.7" data-end="182.2"> It was very baked into how society and the economy worked all throughout the Roman world.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="182.2" data-end="185.29999999999998"> So it would not be weird on its surface.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="185.29999999999998" data-end="191.29999999999998"> Pretty much nobody would look at anyone Christian or otherwise having slaves in their household</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="191.29999999999998" data-end="192.89999999999998"> and be like, what are you doing?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="192.89999999999998" data-end="194.89999999999998"> That is a moral abomination.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="194.89999999999998" data-end="201.0"> But weirdly, Paul taking the conclusions of the message of Christ out to their logical ends</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="201.0" data-end="202.89999999999998"> does raise an eyebrow at it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="202.89999999999998" data-end="209.0"> And it looks like the scenario that unfolded in Colossae is that Philemon had a slave named Onesimus</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="209.0" data-end="213.0"> and somehow Onesimus wrongs him and then runs away.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.0" data-end="216.5"> That's a pretty big deal and that's very punishable by Roman law.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="216.5" data-end="222.5"> I don't know how Onesimus ends up visiting Paul in prison, but he does.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="222.5" data-end="226.2"> And through the influence of Paul, he becomes a Christian.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="226.2" data-end="230.9"> Well, now we got ourselves a bona fide conundrum because Philemon is a Christian</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="230.9" data-end="234.9"> and Onesimus is a Christian and Paul's been going around saying that,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="234.9" data-end="237.5"> hey, if you really think about what Jesus is saying here,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="237.5" data-end="243.8"> like we're all sons and daughters of the king and that transcends and trumps the social order of things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="243.8" data-end="249.5"> Well, is Paul going to stick with that or is Paul going to back down because now it's very inconvenient</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="249.5" data-end="254.5"> and he might lose a church by irritating one of the prominent leaders of this church.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="254.5" data-end="261.0"> If Paul were to mishandle the situation and maybe advocate for Onesimus and not give Philemon,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="261.0" data-end="266.5"> the justice that he is owed for the bad behavior of his slave under Roman law,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="269.5" data-end="273.5"> And what's going to happen right now between you and I is a little bit different than anything we've done before.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="280.5" data-end="284.5"> and that is the Apostle Paul because it's a really short letter and I can just read you the whole thing</p>
