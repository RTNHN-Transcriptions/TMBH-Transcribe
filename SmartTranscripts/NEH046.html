        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="102.9" data-end="104.1"> I mean, the king said it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="104.1" data-end="105.8"> The queen would probably vouch for me.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="120.1" data-end="121.2"> You got to get the orders written.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="121.2" data-end="126.4"> You got to get the whole thing in writing so that it is real and so that the will of the king will extend.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="126.6" data-end="127.4"> How do you do that?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="127.4" data-end="129.0"> Well, work orders and receipts.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.3" data-end="136.0"> And last time around, I was telling you that receipts from the Persian world or something that you can still see, you can still hold that in your hand.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.0" data-end="150.6"> And as we look at the brass tax part of this conversation between Nehemiah and the king, I got to imagine that there's some of these little clay shard receipts rattling around in his pocket as he goes on his trip because he was going to need to show this stuff to a lot of people along the way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="150.6" data-end="152.0"> Here's a passage I'm talking about.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.3" data-end="155.2"> The brass tax portion starts in Nehemiah 2 7.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.2" data-end="160.5"> This is Nehemiah first person talking about what happened as he was talking with King Artaxerxes of Persia.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.1" data-end="165.8"> I also said to him, if it pleases the king may have letters to the governors of trans Euphrates</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.8" data-end="169.4"> so that they will provide me with safe conduct until I arrive in Judah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="169.8" data-end="180.60000000000002"> And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the Citadel by the temple and for the city wall for the residents.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="180.70000000000002" data-end="181.60000000000002"> I will occupy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.60000000000002" data-end="181.8"> Okay.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.8" data-end="188.4"> So three things here that Nehemiah wants to build, but he's not really asking permission to build these three things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="188.70000000000002" data-end="191.4"> He's asking permission for the work order.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="191.4" data-end="195.5"> He's asking permission to use the resources of the kingdom.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="195.8" data-end="206.8"> And there's no appearance that the king walks as Nehemiah is saying, okay, as discussed, we're going to need to make the timber for the beams for the gates of the Citadel.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="206.9" data-end="216.9"> And we're going to need to obviously take care of that wall we discussed, but implicitly here, this is going to be saying, obviously I'll be the temporary governor or the regional representative of the king.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="216.9" data-end="221.4"> Well, I'm there and I'm going to need some sort of residence to indicate that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="221.8" data-end="223.5"> Is he just being greedy?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="223.5" data-end="230.3"> Well, if culturally this was a greedy ask, then I think the king sours on the deal at this point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="230.8" data-end="238.4"> I think rather what we're seeing here is the theme of Nehemiah's request is I need these things to make it official.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="238.5" data-end="253.4"> And I suspect that having some sort of residence that is evocative of a representative of the king would be in keeping with the spirit of having these documents and these letters and these receipts and these work orders and traveling with a royal retinue.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="253.4" data-end="258.7"> Like you're not going to travel with a royal retinue and then go stay in a dumpy tent in the slums of Jerusalem.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="258.9" data-end="260.5"> That makes the king look bad.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="260.8" data-end="267.7"> And I also got to think that beyond the request to just rebuild the city as the king's representative, I mean, how is Nehemiah framed it?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="267.7" data-end="269.5"> It's the place where his fathers are buried.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="269.8" data-end="271.4"> This is my ancestral home.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="271.6" data-end="278.5"> Obviously, I mean, what kind of son would I be if I went back and I didn't rebuild our home in some way at the same time?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="278.8" data-end="288.2"> I suppose maybe he's pushing his luck here, but I think it makes sense given the context and it makes sense given the moment they are in in the conversation, which is the brass tax moment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="288.2" data-end="289.9"> Can we get this in writing?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="290.2" data-end="293.0"> Not just because I think you're going to violate my trust.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="293.0" data-end="293.6"> Oh, great, King.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="293.6" data-end="294.9"> The second I turn around.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="295.3" data-end="296.1"> That's not the case.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="296.4" data-end="298.9"> The king is Nehemiah's champion in this whole endeavor.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="298.9" data-end="306.0"> The whole endeavor is happening because Nehemiah is going to say here in a minute that God providentially prompted the heart of the king to do it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="306.0" data-end="308.4"> Now, the artaxerxes isn't the problem here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="308.8" data-end="316.4"> It's all the people who are far, far away from artaxerxes and artaxerxes tether, even though he has their earth and water and a little jar on his shelf.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="316.7" data-end="322.5"> The tether gets weaker the further from Sousa you're going to get and both of these men know that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="322.5" data-end="326.2"> And so having it in writing is going to be a very important thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="326.4" data-end="328.6"> What does that in writing look like?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="328.7" data-end="338.4"> Well, resource wise, one of the things that's going to convey the authority of the king is coinage, which interestingly enough wasn't really a Persian thing until they had contact.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="338.5" data-end="350.3"> With the Greeks in Asia Minor modern day Turkey, there was a guy named cresis who reigned during the age of Cyrus the Great going on about a hundred years before the events were looking at Nehemiah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="350.7" data-end="353.1"> And I mean, there's a saying, rich is cresis.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="353.2" data-end="360.6"> Sky was loaded when Cyrus saw the efficiency of the way he had coined precious metals.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="360.6" data-end="362.5"> That was something that set in motion.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="362.5" data-end="367.9"> The Persians beginning to adopt that Persian coinage is a thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="367.9" data-end="373.29999999999995"> But that was primarily used to conduct international business.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="373.29999999999995" data-end="375.29999999999995"> We learned that from Herodotus.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="381.29999999999995" data-end="382.9"> No, let's put a pin in it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="382.9" data-end="392.29999999999995"> There's something else that I found in Herodotus that totally relates to the relationship between Heyman and Mordecai that we talked about in the book of Esther.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="392.29999999999995" data-end="395.5"> I'm just I'm going to tease it, but we'll get to that next time around.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="395.5" data-end="397.29999999999995"> Let's finish the receipts thing for now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="397.3" data-end="405.1"> So coinage would have been part of the deal, but that was more for international relations primarily according to Herodotus.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="405.1" data-end="408.1"> Of course coinage is easier to move.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="408.1" data-end="420.1"> I mean, that's part of the advantage of money is you can have a handful of coins and it can represent a gigantic weight, a gigantic volume of practical goods and expensive to move the practical goods.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="420.1" data-end="426.7"> When you could just move the coinage and be like, all right, I got all this wheat right here, but I want to send this wheat.</p>
