        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="514.12" data-end="517.12"> I'm going to get it and we're going to high five and we're going to move on. It's going to be awesome.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="517.12" data-end="523.12"> And so it's fine. If you can't make sense of all of these names and you can't remember who connects with who, these are the big ones you need to remember.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="523.12" data-end="538.12"> Zerubable. He was the guy who should have been king and if there was still a kingdom, he would have been king, but instead he was the false king of a subject people to Cyrus the Great, but he was allowed to lead the Jews back to Israel to rebuild the temple.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="538.12" data-end="544.12"> It took a long time, but he succeeded. The high priest who was with him was Jeshua.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="544.12" data-end="549.12"> He's the guy who got the initial sacrifices up and running before there even was a temple.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="549.12" data-end="562.12"> Jeshua probably served for a very long time and then his son, Joy Kim, who must have been a legendary high priest, served over a robust temple environment for a very long time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="562.12" data-end="570.12"> Tons of names involved in that world and that era of society and Nehemiah and Ezra want you to know that was all legit.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="570.12" data-end="582.12"> It goes on, verse 22, the family heads of the Levites in the days of Elia Shib, Jodiah and Johanon and Jadua as well as those of the priests were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="582.12" data-end="591.12"> Now we don't know what Darius we're talking about here. We know it's not Darius I, the father of Xerxes because that's, I mean, it's just wrong.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="591.12" data-end="597.12"> A lot of these people weren't even born, probably when Darius was king. So it can't be Darius I, we're talking about here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="597.12" data-end="605.12"> But it could be Darius II who was king from 423 to 404. So about 20 years after the events we're looking at here in Nehemiah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="605.12" data-end="615.12"> Or maybe they're trying to track this list of people involved in the priestly duties all the way forward to the age of Darius III, the last king of Persia.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="615.12" data-end="620.12"> He was defeated by Alexander the Great in the 330s BC.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="620.12" data-end="626.12"> So there are some people who would make the argument that what we're getting here in Nehemiah chapter 12 is a look back all the way to the beginning of the period.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="626.12" data-end="644.12"> The beginning of the Persian Empire, a look here at the middle of the Persian Empire during the era of Nehemiah and Artaxerxes and a look forward all the way to the end of the Persian Empire with the final Persian king that being Darius III defeated by Alexander the Great, which ended the Persian Empire.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="644.12" data-end="656.12"> This could be interpreted as though we are to understand this as a full spectrum view of the continuity of the priestly families and the high priests all the way through the era of Persia.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="656.12" data-end="673.12"> I think that's a pretty valid read. Here's how it rounds out. The family heads among the descendants of Levi up to the time of Johan and Son of Elia Sheba recorded in the book of the annals and the leaders of the Levites were Hashemiah, Shrabbiah, Jeshua, Son of Chadmiel, and their associates who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="673.12" data-end="683.12"> As prescribed by David, the man of God, Matiniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Mesulam, Talman, and Akhub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="683.12" data-end="692.12"> They served in the days of Joya Kheem, Son of Jeshua. There we go again. Jeshua the high priest with Zerubable, Joya Kheem, his son who no doubt served for a very long time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="692.12" data-end="699.12"> The son of Josodak, so that's Jeshua's dad. And in the days of Nehemiah, the governor and of Ezra, the priest and scribe.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="699.12" data-end="709.12"> So two guys, Jeshua and Joya Kheem had served in this role since 538 BC all the way up till at least now in 444 BC.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="709.12" data-end="718.12"> That's a pretty impressive showing on their part and their role, just as those two guys have a steadying effect on the whole narrative.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="718.12" data-end="728.12"> And I think that the way the original audience was intended to read this was to say, dang, this line of priests, this religious thing that we have is bigger than Persia.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="728.12" data-end="739.12"> Empires will rise and fall. Persia even came and went during the era of these priests, this one looking back, this one right now, and these one or two looking forward.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="739.12" data-end="748.12"> That's all it took for Persia. I purchase a blink of an eye. What even is that? But no, Jerusalem and the temple and the sacrificial system and God's chosen people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="749.12" data-end="759.12"> And the high priesthood, that is what is steady moving forward. That is what you should anchor yourselves to everyone once again.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="759.12" data-end="765.12"> In Nehemiah's mind and in Ezra's mind, in stand and where they ought to be, stand and do in what they ought to be doing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="765.12" data-end="773.12"> There is absolute continuity here in their mind. Continuity that you as a reader can count on in their mind and they want you to see that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="773.12" data-end="780.12"> Because if indeed they have put everything back in place and there is continuity, then maybe the toothpaste can go back in the tube.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="780.12" data-end="788.12"> Maybe it's Persian, Babylon and Assyria that are flashes in the pan. Maybe this thing is the more real thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="788.12" data-end="795.12"> That's what they want you to think about. Legitimacy and historical continuity are the points of this passage.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="795.12" data-end="800.12"> Great job hanging in with me on this one and not being discouraged. This is a complex thing. It's easy to get overwhelmed by it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="800.12" data-end="803.12"> But I think we handled our business all right and we're moving forward tomorrow.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="803.12" data-end="808.12"> And Matt, this is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.</p>
