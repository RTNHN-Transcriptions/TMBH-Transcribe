        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="11.5"> We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Haggai.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="11.5" data-end="23.5"> When you turn the page, as you're reading straight through the Bible, from Zephaniah to Haggai,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="23.5" data-end="27.2"> there is a mountain of change that occurs.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="27.2" data-end="32.3"> And in order to understand where we are now and get oriented and wrap our heads around</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.3" data-end="37.1"> what Haggai is talking about, we're going to have to lay a little bit of groundwork here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="37.1" data-end="43.7"> All of these Old Testament prophets we've been reading up to this point are largely set in one of two eras.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="43.7" data-end="49.2"> That is the mid-700s BC, right at the end of the Northern Kingdom of Israel,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="49.2" data-end="56.1"> and all those prophets charge the Northern Kingdom with evil and corruption and wicked leadership</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="56.1" data-end="62.300000000000004"> and economic injustice, and they all anticipate Assyria coming along and conquering the Northern Kingdom,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="62.300000000000004" data-end="66.6"> which happened under Sargon II in 722 BC.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="66.6" data-end="70.5"> Then there's another flurry of Old Testament prophecy we've been looking at</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="70.5" data-end="74.1"> that is directed largely at the remaining southern kingdom of Judah</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="74.1" data-end="80.6"> that makes the same charges in the late 600s BC about corruption and evil and economic injustice.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="80.6" data-end="85.5"> But these prophets are pointing toward this dark gathering storm on the horizon</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="85.5" data-end="90.1"> that is Babylon and they correctly anticipate the destruction of the southern kingdom</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.1" data-end="96.6"> and the temple where God lives in 586 BC by Nebuchadnezzar of the Babylonians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="96.6" data-end="99.9"> But then we turn the page over to Haggai and everything looks different.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.9" data-end="103.3"> For starters, this layout of the text looks different.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="103.3" data-end="107.2"> It's going to look in your Bible more like the block formatting of Genesis or Exodus,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="107.2" data-end="109.1"> like narrative the way it's presented.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="109.1" data-end="111.7"> Whereas all of the prophets we've been looking at up till this point,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.7" data-end="114.1"> mostly it looks like the way Psalms is laid out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="114.1" data-end="119.69999999999999"> It's poetry or at least a poetic structure in the way these prophecies are given.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.69999999999999" data-end="125.0"> Further, we discover that we've fast forwarded almost a hundred years</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.0" data-end="130.5"> since what we were looking at with Zephaniah all the way past the era of the Babylonians</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="130.5" data-end="133.7"> and into the early era of the Persians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="133.7" data-end="136.1"> So a whole empire has fallen in between.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="136.1" data-end="140.6"> Babylon is gone, deposed by Cyrus the Great and Persia.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.6" data-end="144.4"> And if we go back and look at Ezra and Nehemiah,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="144.4" data-end="146.2"> we can piece things together.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="146.2" data-end="149.6"> Also, we can go back and just look at history books because now we're into the stuff</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="149.6" data-end="152.1"> that's really well documented extra biblically.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.1" data-end="156.6"> And we can see that Cyrus the Great conquered the Babylonians in 539.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="156.6" data-end="160.9"> And then in 538, he's like, we're not going to rule like the Assyrians and the Babylonians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="160.9" data-end="163.9"> We're going to let some of these conquered people groups go back,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.9" data-end="170.1"> rebuild their home countries and have a degree of self-governance still subject to Persia.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="170.1" data-end="178.29999999999998"> Of course, that mixed with violent expansion is how Cyrus built up the Persian Empire so quickly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="178.29999999999998" data-end="181.5"> Cyrus just couldn't get enough of conquering things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.5" data-end="184.6"> And he died at the hands of a warrior queen in the far north.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="184.6" data-end="189.1"> And that created a little bit of a succession crisis in early Persia.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="189.1" data-end="192.4"> His son, Cambyses, was given the kingdom.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="573.4" data-end="578.7"> Then finally on December 18th, 520, Haggai speaks again a couple of times.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="579.1" data-end="590.7"> And one of those, he reiterates the idea that you need to do this right and with purity and pure hearts so that what you are building will be built on a foundation of doing things right with purity and pure hearts.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="591.0" data-end="598.9000000000001"> And then he goes on to talk about that idea of the day of the Lord again, like what we saw in Joel, this concept that the nations are going to be judged.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="605.8" data-end="614.4"> And finally, he says to the rubable in so many words that there's going to be a restoration of David's royal line.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="614.4" data-end="620.1"> And of course he's saying that to the rubable because the rubable is a part of David's royal line.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="620.4" data-end="627.3"> I love the way extra biblical history and the stuff that we see Haggai saying overlap and intertwine so neatly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="627.3" data-end="630.0"> It just makes the book that much more understandable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="630.0" data-end="644.0"> But I also love the fact that Haggai is very optimistic about the role that people play in the unfolding of God's plan and the fact that God is ordained that people get to take part in this and that it actually matters.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="644.0" data-end="654.5"> When you visualize the book of Haggai, picture those paneled houses and everybody was building because they were so eager to have a fancy house and a gotten board of building a house for God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="654.5" data-end="662.0"> When you think about the theme, reflect on restoring God's dwelling place as a part of the grand story of redemption.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="662.0" data-end="674.0"> And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, which you probably do have time to read the whole thing, it goes pretty quick, at least make sure to check out chapter 1, verse 13 and chapter 2, verses 20 through the end of the chapter.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="674.0" data-end="675.5"> This was a tough one for me.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="675.5" data-end="680.5"> There was so much more stuff that I wanted to do and that I wanted to get into with the Persia business.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="680.5" data-end="695.5"> If that wedded your appetite and you find that stuff fascinating as well, please plan to stick with me when we get done with this series because we are going to deep dive into the book of Esther and all of this Persia, exile, historical stuff.</p>
