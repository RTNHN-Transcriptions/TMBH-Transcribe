        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="11.5"> We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Nehem.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="11.5" data-end="25.5"> If you just pick up a Bible and start reading straight through it, you will get a whole lot of Nineveh in the book of Jonah,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.5" data-end="32.5"> which describes events that happened in the mid-ish 700s BC.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.5" data-end="39.5"> Well, at least part of it happens in Assyria, this great evil nation to the north that oppresses people,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="39.5" data-end="45.5"> and everybody around Assyria hates Assyria and cannot wait for Assyria to go away.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="45.5" data-end="51.5"> And as you'll recall with Jonah, he doesn't even want to go preach there, because he's deep down,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="51.5" data-end="58.5"> suspicious that God is going to relent, and that he is going to forgive the people if they repent.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="58.5" data-end="64.5"> And so he's fussy, and he goes and he phones it in and does a terrible job, a tank job on his preaching,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="64.5" data-end="71.5"> but for some weird reason, the king of Nineveh relents, and everybody asks for God's forgiveness.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.5" data-end="74.5"> And sure enough, God's like, okay, I'm going to spare all those people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="74.5" data-end="76.5"> That's a lot of people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="76.5" data-end="83.5"> Even a few more prophetic books go by, and the next time we get a really good look at Nineveh</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.5" data-end="88.5"> is in the prophetic book that we're looking at today, which is Nahum.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="88.5" data-end="95.5"> This book is written about a hundred years later, and kind of a lot's happened since we last saw Nineveh.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="95.5" data-end="101.5"> For example, one of the two most notable things that has happened in Nineveh in the interim</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="101.5" data-end="105.5"> totally forgot all of that stuff about Jonah, and what they said they were going to do,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.5" data-end="109.5"> and the repentance thing and all of that business, it did not stick.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="109.5" data-end="110.5"> Maybe it did for a generation?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="110.5" data-end="111.5"> I don't know.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.5" data-end="120.5"> It looks like in the reign of Jeroboam II, who was the king in the early 700s BC, up to somewhere</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="120.5" data-end="124.5"> in the mid 700s BC in the northern kingdom of Israel.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="124.5" data-end="129.5"> It looks like during that time of Jeroboam II, Israel was really powerful and able to expand</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.5" data-end="133.5"> their borders as Jonah predicted they would be able to.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="133.5" data-end="135.5"> They were able to do that because Assyria was in a downswing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="135.5" data-end="140.5"> We don't know exactly what the problem was there, but there's plenty of evidence to suggest</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.5" data-end="146.5"> that Assyria was having a leadership crisis, and they were wobbling at that time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="146.5" data-end="151.5"> Maybe that's why the people of Nineveh were in a place where they were willing to respond</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="151.5" data-end="153.5"> before they weren't the big dogs anymore.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="153.5" data-end="158.5"> They were a little shaken, a little uncertain about their future, but we also know that</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="158.5" data-end="164.5"> after that time that Jonah was up there, things got back on track pretty quick for</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="164.5" data-end="168.5"> Assyria and Nineveh, which is a big Assyrian city.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="168.5" data-end="173.5"> And as soon as they pulled it back together, they got back to conquering and being very,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="173.5" data-end="178.5"> very violent and evil and oppressive as they had always been in the past.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="178.5" data-end="182.5"> So I'm guessing that the Ninevites were like, yeah, I don't know.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="182.5" data-end="183.5"> We're good now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="183.5" data-end="187.5"> We can trust in our swords and spears and chariots and our money, and we'll just</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="187.5" data-end="192.5"> move forward, kind of forgetting that embarrassing incident where we acted like we believed in</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="192.5" data-end="193.5"> a foreign deity.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="193.5" data-end="197.5"> Actually, speaking of that foreign deity, we should go conquer those people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="197.5" data-end="203.5"> And I guess that's the second big notable thing that happens between the scene and Nineveh</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="203.5" data-end="208.5"> in Jonah and the mentioning of Nineveh that we're getting here in the Book of Nahum is</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="219.5" data-end="223.5"> Well, a few years later, they decide to press their luck a little further and go and attack</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="254.5" data-end="257.5"> Well, whatever happened with the Assyrians, whatever happened with Nineveh up there,</p>
