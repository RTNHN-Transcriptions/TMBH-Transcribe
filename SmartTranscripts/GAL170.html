        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.98" data-end="85.98"> And understandably, it's a pretty touchy topic for the reason that you would expect because of what circumcision is.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="85.98" data-end="91.98"> I don't know if you had eighth grade health or if they cover this in there, but it's where they cut the skin right off the penis right there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="91.98" data-end="94.98"> And then usually they do it to little babies, right?</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="101.98" data-end="103.98"> You just get circumcised again.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.98" data-end="111.98"> But adult circumcision, that's a different deal.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.98" data-end="116.98"> I think the adults remember when they get circumcised.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="116.98" data-end="125.98"> Probably primarily because of the agonizing pain that I imagine comes from chopping on that part of their body.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.98" data-end="130.98000000000002"> So you got the obvious reason that circumcision is a touchy subject.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="134.98" data-end="144.98"> And that is what it had meant in recent decades and centuries to the people involved in this conversation here in the book of Galatians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="144.98" data-end="146.98"> So with all that said, there's my disclaimer.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="149.98" data-end="159.98"> It's kind of low hanging fruit here to just go in and cut it up with these hilarious little circumcision jokes, many of which I'm sure I could think of if I absolutely wanted to.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="160.98" data-end="163.98"> But we're adults and we're going to handle this with dignity and we're on a bit of a schedule here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.98" data-end="166.98"> And I don't even want to take one little slice out of the amount of time that we have.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="166.98" data-end="179.98"> So Jeff, if you catch anything that even sounds like some sort of cheap, lazy, uninspired circumcision joke while we're covering this stuff, that would be off brand and off color and out of place.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="179.98" data-end="182.98"> Just go ahead and slice that out in post.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="182.98" data-end="184.98"> Okay, Paul writes the following.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="196.98" data-end="200.98"> It's kind of the theme for the home stretch of the book of Galatians.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="228.98" data-end="233.98"> For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="378.98" data-end="383.98"> But the other reason is because this was a boundary marker of Judaism.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="383.98" data-end="395.98"> It was a boundary marker for the people who followed the one true God and it was part of this really unique identity of the Jewish people going back all the way forever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="395.98" data-end="397.98"> I mean, thousands of years at this point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="397.98" data-end="402.98"> The sign of God's relationship with his chosen people of all things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="402.98" data-end="403.98"> And I'm not God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="403.98" data-end="408.98"> I've heard real smart people work up theories about why it had to be circumcision.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="408.98" data-end="410.98"> I'm not sold on any of those theories.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="410.98" data-end="417.98"> Right now, my working theory for why God chose circumcision as the sign of his covenant is because that's what he picked.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="417.98" data-end="418.98"> I don't know.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="418.98" data-end="419.98"> I didn't write it out of that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="419.98" data-end="421.98"> That's just what he went with.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="421.98" data-end="423.98"> It's certainly very intimate.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="423.98" data-end="424.98"> You got to give it that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="424.98" data-end="428.98"> But whatever you make of that sign, that is what God commanded.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="428.98" data-end="433.98"> And that is what all Israelite men had done forever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="433.98" data-end="447.98"> It was expected it was a mark of you are a people set aside, a unique and holy people who are supposed to be dedicated to the Lord for the glory of the Lord in this world through the covenants that he's made with you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="447.98" data-end="454.98"> And stuff struck at that identity as the world changed coming out of the end of the Old Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="454.98" data-end="457.98"> Now, you'll recall the Old Testament ends with the Persian era.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="457.98" data-end="486.98"> And even during the era of captivity before that, when the Babylonians were in charge and then when the Persians were in charge and the 500s and 400s BC, you can tell it was pretty difficult for some of these young men like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, Ezekiel to participate in these foreign cultures, particularly Babylon, because they had different expectations about what's clean and not clean and what's pure and not pure and how to do dietary stuff.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="486.98" data-end="499.98"> And it's not too tough to read between the lines and know that the circumcision thing probably set those early exiles apart in perhaps a bit of an awkward way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="499.98" data-end="508.98"> Circumcision on the rare occasions where in polite society you would have observed that on a Jewish man.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="509.98" data-end="521.98"> I don't know. How do you know? Well, they did know from time to time. Apparently they knew and apparently it was very off putting and shocking to people who weren't Jewish that this was the sign of the covenant. What an odd thing. Why would your people do that to themselves? Okay, whatever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="521.98" data-end="530.98"> I'm tempted at this point to super rushy finish line this, but I want to flesh the whole thing out. I want to work through this idea completely and this story completely.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="530.98" data-end="543.98"> I think that what's at the end of this conversation is something that causes us to feel a little more empathy for the agitators here, but also causes us to feel even more certainly that Paul is right and they are wrong.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="543.98" data-end="548.98"> So I want to take our time on it. I'm going to pause right here and we'll just pick up where we left off next time around.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="548.98" data-end="554.98"> But first quickly on the way out the door, I noticed a handful you signed up to support the thing on Patreon this week.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="555.98" data-end="565.98"> That was wildly encouraging. Thank you for doing that. I have been so out of the loop on things. I'm barely keeping my head above water with this book project and other things that I've been doing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="565.98" data-end="578.98"> You probably have noticed I'm not posting YouTube videos hardly at all. And for the first time in a year and a half, just in the last couple of days, I can breathe and be a human again.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="578.98" data-end="585.98"> And so I've been going back through and seeing some of the lovely comments that you've written on Patreon and other places.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="585.98" data-end="591.98"> I've read a bunch of the reviews that you've written of late. And then I see a few of you signed up to support the thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="591.98" data-end="599.98"> I've been in a very good, but very challenging time in my life, like pretty much no other time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="600.98" data-end="609.98"> And sort of come out of this crazy season, catch my breath and see all of that, which is very encouraging. And I want to say thank you. So there's my thank you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="609.98" data-end="616.98"> That felt like a big time tonal mismatch with the episode that we just did, but we're going to live with it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="616.98" data-end="620.98"> All right, more in the circumcision stuff next time around. And thank you. Both can be true at once.</p>
