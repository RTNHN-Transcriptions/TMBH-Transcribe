        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="454.32" data-end="456.44"> Jesus goes and dies on a cross.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="456.44" data-end="466.36"> But then as he predicted three days later, he comes back to life and he does so in front of a whole bunch of witnesses and not just witnesses who like him, witnesses who aren't rooting for him.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="466.71999999999997" data-end="481.56"> And the religious leaders can't produce the body and Jesus empowers his disciples to take the message and run with it before he ascends into heaven and gives them the Holy Spirit with the bizarre imagery of tongues of fire over their heads.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="481.56" data-end="496.08"> This little group of Jesus followers starts speaking in Jerusalem and languages that theoretically don't speak, but everybody's understanding the message of Jesus in their own language and thousands of people start signing up to follow Jesus immediately.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="496.32" data-end="500.72"> And that does not seem to ever lose pace throughout the entire Bible story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="500.96000000000004" data-end="509.76000000000005"> Even when the religious leadership starts cracking down on Jesus disciples and the next generation of disciples after that, even killing them, it does nothing to dissuade them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="509.76000000000005" data-end="514.44"> They just communicate the message of Jesus harder and miraculous stuff keeps happening.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="514.8000000000001" data-end="526.1600000000001"> And indeed, one of the people who was initially killing the Jewish people ends up converting to faith in Christ after an encounter with the risen Jesus on his way up to hurt more Christians in Damascus.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="526.3199999999999" data-end="541.64"> And then this fellow, whose name was Saul and eventually comes to be known as Paul, starts making these missionary journeys all around the Mediterranean world, telling people in ways that they would understand in their given culture and community who Jesus is and how this supplies to them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="541.88" data-end="548.8399999999999"> And all of a sudden the Gentiles are in. This isn't even just a Jewish thing anymore. It goes global in a matter of a few years.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="549.08" data-end="560.0400000000001"> Now these churches aren't perfect. And so Paul and others are always writing back and forth, trying to help them navigate what it is to be a Christian in their community in the face of persecution.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="560.36" data-end="576.12"> And ultimately, even though the big names in terms of early Christian leaders like James, the brother of Jesus, who was the head of the church in Jerusalem and Peter, the most prominent of Jesus immediate circle of disciples.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="576.36" data-end="589.24"> And Paul, the disciple to the Gentiles, even though those guys and all the big name disciples who were with Jesus other than John meet fantastically gory ends as martyrs for the message of Christ.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="589.4" data-end="598.36"> It doesn't slow anything down. More people keep becoming Christians. They live with the values of the kingdom that Christ was talking about clear back in that sermon on the Mount.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="598.6800000000001" data-end="612.36"> And indeed, the church has never looked back since becoming the biggest global phenomenon in the history of anything ever. And it's not even close in the same way that the first book of the Old Testament looks back to the very dawn of time and even beyond.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="612.6" data-end="625.24"> So the final book in the New Testament looks forward beyond and all the way into the day of the Lord, the era, the time, the moment when everything gets set right. The evil is judged and corrected.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="625.4" data-end="633.08"> The evil nations are finally called to account and Christ's kingdom is established and realized in a visible obvious way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="633.48" data-end="639.64"> And there's a new Jerusalem and God's people are with him and God's spirit dwells with them into eternity.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="639.64" data-end="647.64"> On the whole, I think it's a really good story. If you haven't had a chance to read the whole thing, I encourage you to just pick it up and start chewing through it because it's great.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="647.64" data-end="652.84"> When you visualize a New Testament picture, Jesus Christ crucified and then risen.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="652.9200000000001" data-end="665.24"> When you think about the theme, reflect on Jesus, who is the Messiah and the King who was promised, who died and was resurrected for the sins of the world and will return in justice and power to reign forever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="665.5600000000001" data-end="672.0400000000001"> Also implied in that theme is that you fit in there somehow. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, try to get John and Romans.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="672.44" data-end="681.48"> Cue the New Testament level up sound. Hey, we got one more episode rounding out this series on this whole journey through the Bible. We've done together.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="681.64" data-end="688.44"> And then on Monday, we start the new one on the Book of Esther and I would be elated if you would consider being a part of that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="688.6800000000001" data-end="695.08"> I'm throwing a ton of work at it right now and I'm so excited for what we're going to get into. Finally, I have a request.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="695.72" data-end="706.52"> If you like this stuff and it's been fun, would you leave a review on any and all podcast apps? Obviously, it's always encouraging myself to read that and I do read all of those.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="706.52" data-end="712.04"> But also, podcast apps like to recommend podcasts that get reviews.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="712.04" data-end="721.0"> And so if you go and review this program on any and all podcast apps, it really helps to get new people involved in the conversation and I want that to happen.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="721.24" data-end="727.16"> All right, final big picture thoughts on this whole project tomorrow and then we're on to Esther after that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="727.16" data-end="730.52"> I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="730.52" data-end="739.56"> This podcast is supported by many of you at patreon.com slash the TMVH podcast. We're grateful because it supports our family.</p>
