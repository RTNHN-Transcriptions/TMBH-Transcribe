        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="26.44" data-end="29.28"> and I still don't know exactly how I feel about it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="29.28" data-end="30.68"> I think I like it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="30.68" data-end="33.68"> I mean, visually, I super like it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="33.68" data-end="38.64"> That's as cool of visual experiences I have ever had in a movie in my entire life.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="38.64" data-end="42.08"> I saw it opening night in 2009 in 3D.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="42.08" data-end="47.120000000000005"> I'd never enjoyed a 3D movie experience ever until that one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="47.120000000000005" data-end="50.16"> And I think I turned around the next day and watched it again in 3D.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="50.16" data-end="53.120000000000005"> But it wasn't because of the plot or the characters.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="56.84" data-end="59.56"> The plot's just basically space dances with wolves.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="59.56" data-end="62.96"> So I'd already seen that story played out several times.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="62.96" data-end="69.2"> But the environment, Pandora, the imaginary space Eden, where all of this plays out,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="69.2" data-end="71.96000000000001"> was so engrossing and beautiful.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.96000000000001" data-end="78.48"> I felt like an explorer every time we panned around that world with my 3D glasses on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.48" data-end="80.84"> And I just wanted to get back there.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.12" data-end="84.2"> I admit that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="84.28" data-end="88.0"> But something I learned after the fact that's really interesting to me about Avatar</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="88.0" data-end="90.36"> is that it was written way before it was made.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.36" data-end="96.72"> James Cameron wrote it in the early 90s around the same time that dances with wolves was being made, I guess.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="96.72" data-end="99.84"> And he didn't make it for another 15 plus years.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.84" data-end="105.04"> And his reason was that the technology wasn't there to realize his vision.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.04" data-end="108.64"> There's a very specific thing that he needed to accomplish visually,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.64" data-end="113.88"> one in the environment to make it so you would feel like I felt when you went to Pandora.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.88" data-end="115.32"> It needed to blow your mind.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.32" data-end="120.8"> It needed to be a place so beautiful that you as the viewer would want to see it saved.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="120.8" data-end="128.12"> The second thing is that you needed to believe the CGI characters who were going to carry most of the story,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="128.12" data-end="134.12"> especially because some of those CGI characters, the big blue creatures that maybe you've seen the Navi,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="134.12" data-end="141.76"> they were supposed to be representations of human characters with actors who were famous and who you know.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="141.76" data-end="143.51999999999998"> And so it had to be believable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="143.52" data-end="147.48000000000002"> It had to look good. And I think he pulled it off visually. I think it's just incredible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="147.48000000000002" data-end="151.88"> And if he had tried to make that movie now, would it be as good?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="151.88" data-end="154.20000000000002"> Was this equal as good that came out a few years ago?</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="155.52" data-end="159.08"> I think it's maybe the best CGI thing I've seen in a long time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="159.08" data-end="163.56"> But for the most part, I think everybody agrees that CGI is actually got worse.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="163.56" data-end="168.08"> It's less believable. It looks more like AI slop too often now.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.32000000000002" data-end="178.68"> So maybe James Cameron knew something the rest of us didn't know.</p>
