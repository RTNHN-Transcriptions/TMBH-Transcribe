        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.4"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.4" data-end="12.0"> We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Ecclesiastes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="18.0" data-end="19.0"> Hey, my friends, it's Matt.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="19.0" data-end="23.0"> Thanks for hanging out with me and talking about the book of Ecclesiastes,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="23.0" data-end="25.0"> which I've been sitting here thinking about it,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.0" data-end="28.0"> so I can already tell my tone is different than it normally is on these</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.0" data-end="34.0"> because it's so somber and reflective, and this book has resonated with me</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="34.0" data-end="40.0"> and touched my heart at every point of my story as a person,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="40.0" data-end="43.0"> because it deals with the question that everybody asks at some point,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="43.0" data-end="46.0"> not even at some point, at multiple points over the course of their life,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="46.0" data-end="49.0"> but we ask this question in different ways over the course of our lives,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="49.0" data-end="51.0"> and that question is, what's the point?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="51.0" data-end="53.0"> What am I doing here?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.0" data-end="56.0"> What is all of this activity I'm engaged in even mean?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="56.0" data-end="60.0"> Even the beautiful stuff about life even mean.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="60.0" data-end="65.0"> Ecclesiastes is part of the wisdom and writing literature of the Old Testament,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="65.0" data-end="69.0"> along with Job, Psalms and Proverbs, and then Ecclesiastes,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="69.0" data-end="71.0"> and then the Song of Songs or Song of Solomon.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.0" data-end="75.0"> Now, on the surface, it looks like Ecclesiastes is holding itself out</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="75.0" data-end="77.0"> as being written probably by Solomon.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="77.0" data-end="78.0"> This is the opening line.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.0" data-end="83.0"> The words of the preacher or the teacher, the son of David, King in Jerusalem.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.0" data-end="87.0"> They're on in the book, the first person author talks about how they were wiser</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="87.0" data-end="90.0"> than anybody else and all of their achievements and money and wealth,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.0" data-end="92.0"> and they talk about the holiness of that stuff.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="92.0" data-end="95.0"> So it really does seem to line up that this is Solomon,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="95.0" data-end="97.0"> which can then cause the reader to be like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="97.0" data-end="102.0"> well, probably the companion book in this wisdom literature to Ecclesiastes</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="102.0" data-end="107.0"> then would be Proverbs, because they both look like they have a whole lot of Solomon in them,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="107.0" data-end="109.0"> but I don't think that's the case.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="109.0" data-end="113.0"> I think the companion book of Ecclesiastes is Job,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.0" data-end="116.0"> but where Job tackles the suffering end of things,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="116.0" data-end="121.0"> Ecclesiastes is tackling another difficult emotion,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="121.0" data-end="124.0"> but it's one that can be born out of the exact opposite of suffering.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="124.0" data-end="127.0"> It's one that can be born out of everything going great.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="127.0" data-end="132.0"> Ecclesiastes is tackling that numb feeling, that melancholy</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="132.0" data-end="135.0"> that can set in even when we're getting the things we want,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="135.0" data-end="138.0"> but then quickly realize this isn't satisfying.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="138.0" data-end="142.0"> This is a very real part of the entire human experience,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="142.0" data-end="145.0"> at least after early childhood,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.0" data-end="147.0"> and it would be weird if the Bible never tackled that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="147.0" data-end="151.0"> So high five Bible, great job for dealing with the big questions</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="151.0" data-end="154.0"> that people deal with in a way that we can relate to,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="154.0" data-end="156.0"> and in a way that isn't weird and preachy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="156.0" data-end="160.0"> Ecclesiastes comes alongside you no matter where you're at in life,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="160.0" data-end="164.0"> no matter what is prompted you to ask the question, what's the point?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="164.0" data-end="166.0"> And it puts an arm around you and is like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="166.0" data-end="171.0"> hey, I get it. We all get to that question at some point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="171.0" data-end="176.0"> Welcome. Let's think about it together and I'll honestly share my experiences with you,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="176.0" data-end="178.0"> says the author of Ecclesiastes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="178.0" data-end="183.0"> But the bigger question on the front end for understanding Ecclesiastes</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="183.0" data-end="188.0"> is what do you do with this one word that is clearly the hinge word,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="188.0" data-end="190.0"> the theme word of the whole thing?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="190.0" data-end="193.0"> It's a word that the original audience would have understood,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="193.0" data-end="195.0"> or else this book wouldn't have stood the test of time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="195.0" data-end="197.0"> Nobody would have got it. Nobody would have resonated with it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="197.0" data-end="200.0"> But it is apparently pretty difficult to translate,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="200.0" data-end="202.0"> and this word is Hevel.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="202.0" data-end="204.0"> The English versions of the Bible I read when I was a kid</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="207.0" data-end="210.0"> So then Ecclesiastes would open saying meaningless, meaningless says the teacher.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="210.0" data-end="212.0"> Everything is meaningless.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="214.0" data-end="218.0"> And then in other translations that I read now, I see this word being rendered as vanity.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="218.0" data-end="221.0"> But then somewhere along the way in school somebody pointed out to me that this word Hevel</p>
