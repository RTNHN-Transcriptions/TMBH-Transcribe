        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="19.84" data-end="27.2"> Who's on the right side of The Search Protector is a question that would only make sense to you if you listened to yesterday's episode</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="27.2" data-end="31.439999999999998"> and is probably deeply confusing for those of you who were here for the first time ever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="31.439999999999998" data-end="39.2"> Hi, by the way, my name is Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. We're working on the book of Galatians, just chipping away at it a little bit every day.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="39.2" data-end="45.68"> You're good at math. You can see that this is like episode 100 and something, and we're only in Galatians chapter 3.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="45.68" data-end="50.56"> So it just takes a minute. I don't know. All the Bible is connected to a whole lot of the rest of the Bible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="50.56" data-end="58.480000000000004"> And so you start working on stuff, especially stuff that's dense, theology, like what you get in the little book of Galatians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="58.480000000000004" data-end="66.32000000000001"> And you're just gonna, you can't help it. You take this little rabbit trail, these little side jaunts all over the Bible, and so it makes it take a little longer.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="66.32000000000001" data-end="73.84"> That's why we're only through two and a half chapters. That's why we're only in the middle of chapter 3 here in episode 100 and whatever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="74.8" data-end="86.80000000000001"> Is that what this one is? It's something like that. It's a lot. So we're all here. Thanks for being here. Whether you're new to the program, whether you've been here for a long time, yesterday, we were using this example of a surge protector.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="86.80000000000001" data-end="90.56"> Right? What does a surge protector do? You plug it into your wall and you turn it on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.56" data-end="97.52000000000001"> And then if you have delicate electronic equipment that's expensive, you plug that into the surge protector.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="97.52000000000001" data-end="103.36"> And then if you get a lightning storm or something goes weird with the grid and you get a whole bunch of power that you're delicate,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="103.36" data-end="107.76"> valuable electronic items could not ever withstand. They get sizzled. They get fried.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="107.76" data-end="113.84"> Instead of them getting fried, that surge protector takes all of that power, takes all of that punishment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.84" data-end="126.08"> It might get wrecked in the process, but theoretically, your computer, whatever is plugged into that surge protector, is gonna make it because the surge protector absorbed the shock or to stretch the metaphor over to the Bible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="126.08" data-end="134.24"> It took the curse. It became the curse. It became the surge to protect the stuff that was on the other end of it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="134.24" data-end="142.72"> So the question we were talking about yesterday is who's on the good side of the surge protector that is Jesus?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="142.72" data-end="152.64"> Because Paul is making it really clear here in Galatians that Jesus became a curse. Paul says his Galatians 3-10, all who rely on observing the law are under a curse.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.64" data-end="158.0"> For it is written, cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="158.0" data-end="162.72"> Clearly no one is justified before God by the law because the righteous will live by faith.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="162.72" data-end="168.0"> The law isn't based on faith. On the contrary, the man who does these things will live by them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="168.0" data-end="175.04"> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.04" data-end="180.39999999999998"> cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree. He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="180.4" data-end="187.20000000000002"> might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="187.20000000000002" data-end="191.36"> That's a lot of words, but it's a really simple thing that he's communicating.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="191.36" data-end="201.12"> People, humans, we're the delicate, fragile computer, electronic device that cannot withstand the power surge that is coming at some point.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="201.12" data-end="209.68"> If we are to survive that, we have got to be on the right side of the surge protector so that the surge protector can take that one for us or else.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="209.68" data-end="222.24"> We're going to get sizzled. Paul is making the argument that everyone is inherently on the wrong side, the dangerous side of the surge protector by nature of being humans,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="222.24" data-end="229.20000000000002"> by nature of the fact that we live in a fallen world and we do dumb stuff and we do willfully bad stuff and bad things happen.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="229.20000000000002" data-end="235.28"> We try to get things right, but sometimes we get things wrong. All of it, whatever kind of sin, whatever kind of failure you're talking about, it's on all of us.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="235.28" data-end="246.56"> It's the human problem. We all start on the danger side of the surge protector, on the danger side of the curse, but Christ became a curse for us.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="246.56" data-end="252.24"> What he did on the cross, dying on the cross, being raised back to life, just like he said was going to happen.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="252.24" data-end="259.44"> He becomes the ultimate perfect sacrifice for the sins of humanity and absorbs the curse.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="259.44" data-end="269.44"> He becomes sin for us to quote the Apostle Paul from the Book of 2 Corinthians so that we might become the righteousness of God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="269.44" data-end="274.72"> All of that's amazing. Again, the verbiage might seem complicated, but when you really think about it, it's not that complicated at all.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="274.72" data-end="282.24"> What Paul is lying out here, but there's a question, and this is really kind of the question that all of Galatians is dealing with, and that is,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="282.24" data-end="291.28000000000003"> who is on the right side of the surge protector? Who all is over there? What do you have to do to be over there?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="291.28000000000003" data-end="296.56"> Who's on the wrong side of the surge protector and why are they over there?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="296.56" data-end="306.40000000000003"> Well, now in the 21st century, you and I don't think a whole lot about the ethnic division that was in place back then.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="306.4" data-end="309.28"> It's just not how the world is now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="309.28" data-end="319.28"> Well, in the first century AD, in the couple of decades after Jesus of Nazareth lived and taught and did miracles and died and was resurrected and ascended to the right hand of the Father,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="319.28" data-end="324.79999999999995"> in the few decades after that, it was kind of confusing for some people in terms of what they made of that question.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="329.84" data-end="338.08"> And Galatians is a book about that controversy. There were a whole bunch of people who were not ethnically Jewish.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="338.08" data-end="344.88"> They're not a part of God's chosen people. They're not descended from Abraham, and yet they became followers of Christ.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="344.88" data-end="352.08"> They received the Holy Spirit. There was miraculous confirmation that they were on the safe side of the surge protector.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="352.08" data-end="358.47999999999996"> That's very exciting. But then some people who were descended from Abraham, who were ethnically Jewish, came along.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="358.48" data-end="367.6"> They're probably saying we agree about the Jesus thing, him being the surge protector, the one who becomes a curse for us, the one who became sin so that we might become the righteousness of God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="367.6" data-end="376.08000000000004"> But we don't agree as to how one moves from the danger side of the surge protector to the protected side of the surge protector.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="382.8" data-end="389.6"> You have to do Jewish things. You have to augment your genitals if you were a man to get the sign of the covenant with Abraham.</p>
