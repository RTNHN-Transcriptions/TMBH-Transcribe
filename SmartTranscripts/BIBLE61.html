        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="12.0"> We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 2nd Peter.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="12.0" data-end="23.0"> Not too long ago we looked at 2nd Timothy, which was the end of the road for Paul.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="23.0" data-end="28.0"> Now we're in 2nd Peter, and this represents the end of the road for Peter.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.0" data-end="32.0"> This is another letter written by Peter to the same audience who is writing to.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.0" data-end="40.0"> And 1 Peter is a general, mostly Gentile Christian audience in Asia Minor in Turkey.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="40.0" data-end="44.0"> Again, it's in very pro-Roman territory.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="44.0" data-end="50.0"> These are people who have felt under duress and just like everywhere else.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="50.0" data-end="57.0"> False teachers who see an opportunity to exploit this upstart new idea and to glom onto it</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="57.0" data-end="61.0"> and get money and ladies out of the deal for themselves.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="61.0" data-end="66.0"> They've showed up from all different stripes and started to insert false teachings.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="66.0" data-end="71.0"> And now apparently they're even mischaracterizing the teachings of Paul</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.0" data-end="75.0"> to try to throw these people into confusion to separate them from their money</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="75.0" data-end="83.0"> and to gain prideful popularity and the following of their own all ostensibly in the name of Jesus.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.0" data-end="85.0"> But in reality it's all about these false teachers.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="85.0" data-end="89.0"> Well, just like at the end of 2nd Timothy, Paul knew, he'd been arrested a lot of times.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="89.0" data-end="92.0"> He could tell the difference in different flavors of rest.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="92.0" data-end="95.0"> He knew, oh, this is a big one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="95.0" data-end="96.0"> I'm not going to survive this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="96.0" data-end="99.0"> And the tone of the letter reflects it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="99.0" data-end="102.0"> Likewise, Peter had also taken a beating.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="102.0" data-end="104.0"> He knew when it was a big deal.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="104.0" data-end="105.0"> He knew when it was a little deal.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.0" data-end="108.0"> And he could tell that the circumstances surrounding what was going on here,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.0" data-end="113.0"> the heat that had been turned up in Rome, the fact that the Christians were a convenient</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="113.0" data-end="119.0"> scapegoat for some things that were going wrong in the current administration there in Rome.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="119.0" data-end="120.0"> He's just new.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="120.0" data-end="121.0"> I'm not going to survive this thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="121.0" data-end="126.0"> And so maybe this is the only letter that he wrote from that moment of knowledge</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="126.0" data-end="129.0"> right before his execution in the late 60s AD.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.0" data-end="131.0"> Maybe he wrote others as well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="131.0" data-end="134.0"> And this is just the one that we have preserved.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="134.0" data-end="140.0"> But either way, the message is very straightforward as he's writing to these Christians</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="140.0" data-end="146.0"> who are being prayed upon by false teachers who do not love them the way Peter loves them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="146.0" data-end="151.0"> False teachers who do not love Christ as they ought to be loving Christ.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="151.0" data-end="154.0"> And so he writes a letter that communicates this message.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="154.0" data-end="157.0"> Following Jesus is costing me dearly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="157.0" data-end="161.0"> It's going to cost you dearly, and it's totally worth it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.0" data-end="165.0"> So remain faithful in action and belief in your loyalty to Christ.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.0" data-end="169.0"> And so on some levels, what we're getting here is Peter's farewell tour.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="169.0" data-end="170.0"> These are the closing remarks.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="170.0" data-end="175.0"> If I could only say one more thing to you, and it had to fit on a little piece of parchment</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.0" data-end="180.0"> or a little scroll that could only be this big, I guess this is what I would want to say to you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="180.0" data-end="187.0"> But additionally to that, this is sort of Peter vying for the hearts and the loyalty of these</p>
