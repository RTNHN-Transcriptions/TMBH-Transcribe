        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="211.06" data-end="215.3"> And I just let him mostly just tell me things about Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="215.3" data-end="221.38"> And I asked more questions and got the whole story or a big chunk of the story from a totally different perspective.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="221.38" data-end="222.14"> It was just a blast.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="234.14" data-end="244.94"> And three, because that prayer that was in that book, that that girl in the jungle in Costa Rica was praying over the hood of her car facing toward Jerusalem.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="274.18" data-end="289.42"> And as we realize, as he's really got his work cut out for him, if he is to lead the people into a rejuvenated resuscitated relationship with God and he's even willing to hold out hope that maybe if they can stop doing the stupid dance.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="289.42" data-end="302.42"> Steps and maybe if they can remember which dance steps were the right dance steps, then maybe the presence of God in a physically obvious way would be among them again.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="302.5" data-end="315.38"> So in Ezra nine three, he's just got the news about all the stuff that's going wrong and the detestable practices of the neighboring people groups being reintegrated through marriage into the Jewish people, the returning exiles.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="324.42" data-end="335.18"> Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness to the exiles and I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.</p>
