        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.52" data-end="32.519999999999996"> a chapter of the Bible in which a whole bunch of ancient descendants of Abraham, living under Persian rule,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="49.52" data-end="56.52"> over the course of the better part of a hundred years, to put back together their way of life, their religious system,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="56.52" data-end="66.52000000000001"> they rebuilt a temple in there somewhere, they barely staved off eradication at the hands of the vile genocidal maniac named Haman,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="76.52" data-end="82.52"> it's not fashionable at this time, and also it's kind of a dump, and it doesn't have the reputation as being a place where you'd want to live,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="82.52" data-end="91.52"> and the economy is all religious there, and the real way to advance your family's holdings is to move back to the parcels of land</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.52" data-end="115.52"> and all of the other cool things that you and I associate with happening in cities happening there,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="115.52" data-end="123.52"> but it just wasn't fashionable at this point, it wasn't economically desirable, and it required some really forward thinking people,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.52" data-end="128.51999999999998"> like Ezra and particularly Nehemiah, the guy for whom the book is named, to say,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="179.52" data-end="185.52"> But as I said at the outset of our conversation, today we're going to talk about Nehemiah chapter 11,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="185.52" data-end="190.52"> which is a very important chapter in the unfolding of the Bible and in the unfolding of history in general,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="190.52" data-end="196.52"> but it's a chapter that as you read through it doesn't feel super compelling because it's got a lot of names in it,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="196.52" data-end="200.52"> and it's more or less just saying for at least the first two thirds of the chapter,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="200.52" data-end="210.52"> these are the people who agreed either voluntarily or by the drawing of lots to go and repopulate this newly completed city of Jerusalem</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="210.52" data-end="214.52"> for the purposes of long-term goals that we were just talking about a second ago.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="214.52" data-end="221.52"> So how do you handle a chapter in a podcast format like this that involves a whole bunch of names and where you might get bored?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="221.52" data-end="226.52"> Well, I have an idea for that that's so crazy, it just might work.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="226.52" data-end="233.52"> I thought that maybe instead of reading this chapter to you, I could sing this chapter to you to the tune of</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="242.52" data-end="248.52"> These are the provincial leaders who settled in Jerusalem. I'm just kidding. I don't have that kind of energy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="248.52" data-end="252.52"> There's a lot of words and the song goes very fast and we already did this the other day.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="252.52" data-end="254.52"> Nope, nope, I've reconsidered. I'm just going to read it to you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="254.52" data-end="257.52"> These are the provincial leaders who settled in Jerusalem.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="257.52" data-end="263.52"> Now, some Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants, and descendants of Solomon's servants lived in the towns of Judah,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="263.52" data-end="269.52"> each on his own property in the various towns, while other people from both Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="269.52" data-end="274.52"> That was Nehemiah 11, 3, and was that also 4? Yeah, it was also 4.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="274.52" data-end="277.52"> Now, you notice there were a few different groups of people there we were talking about.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="277.52" data-end="283.52"> Some of this is pretty straightforward. We've talked about a lot of priests, the Levites, the temple servants, the descendants of Solomon's servants.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="283.52" data-end="287.52"> These are all people who were a part of the religious rhythm. Of course, they're settled in Jerusalem.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="287.52" data-end="290.52"> That's where the temple is. That's where all the religious stuff happens.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="290.52" data-end="296.52"> We're trying to add other things to the equation. So naturally, those people are going to be there.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="296.52" data-end="301.52"> But there are three ethnic people groups being mentioned here as well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="301.52" data-end="305.52"> That is, descendants of Judah, descendants of Benjamin, and Israelites.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="305.52" data-end="314.52"> Now, the descendants of Judah and the descendants of Benjamin, we would expect, because those are the people who make up the historic southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="314.52" data-end="324.52"> You'll recall that the first king of the unified kingdom of the descendants of Abraham, that was Saul, way back in the day, pre-1000 BC.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="324.52" data-end="329.52"> You will recall that his successor was David, is a pretty rocky transition in power.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="329.52" data-end="339.52"> And then you will recall that after a long and up and down reign from David that is mostly positively characterized in the Bible, his son Solomon took over.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="339.52" data-end="343.52"> And Solomon was the final king of the unified monarchy, the unified kingdom.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="343.52" data-end="350.52"> After that, the 12 tribes of Israel, who had been one kingdom, split into two parts, and 10 of the tribes go with the north.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="350.52" data-end="355.52"> That becomes the kingdom of Israel. And two of the tribes, Judah and Benjamin, go with the south.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="355.52" data-end="361.52"> That becomes the southern kingdom of Judah. The northern kings are depicted in the Bible as being completely morally bankrupt.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="361.52" data-end="367.52"> They follow all of the customs and religious habits of their neighbors, their mess.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="367.52" data-end="372.52"> They get into trouble all the time. And their kingdom is relatively short-lived.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="372.52" data-end="376.52"> They lose to the Assyrians in 732 BC.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="376.52" data-end="381.52"> And are held out as being overwhelmingly lost to history. They get taken away into captivity.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="381.52" data-end="386.52"> And they don't really seem to be brought back, at least as the Bible describes it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="386.52" data-end="393.52"> We don't get any specific description of them being repatriated, of them returning from their exile.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="393.52" data-end="396.52"> They seem to disappear into the fog of history.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="396.52" data-end="402.52"> Judah and Benjamin, on the other hand, they last a little longer until the southern kingdom of Judah is, as we've discussed,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="402.52" data-end="405.52"> many times conquered by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="405.52" data-end="408.52"> Then the Babylonians lose to the Persians, and then the Persians very quickly are like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="408.52" data-end="412.52"> hey, people that got conquered by our predecessors can go back and rebuild things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="412.52" data-end="419.52"> And that's how we get into this whole post-exilic era that you and I have been looking at in Ezra and Nehemiah and Esther.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="419.52" data-end="425.52"> There is no surprise here that the people of Judah and Benjamin are coming back to rebuild what is effectively the southern kingdom,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="425.52" data-end="427.52"> the kingdom of Judah, around Jerusalem.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="427.52" data-end="432.52"> What is a bit of a surprise is that Israelites get mentioned here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="432.52" data-end="436.52"> Now, this point is not fleshed out very much in Nehemiah, but it is here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="436.52" data-end="445.52"> It's on the page. It looks like at least somebody, a few people from the now almost completely forgotten tribes of Israel</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="445.52" data-end="447.52"> who have been wiped off the map now for what we had.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="447.52" data-end="450.52"> I mean, going on 300 years, they've been gone.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="450.52" data-end="455.52"> So think about that. That'd be the equivalent, as I'm recording this, of like the 1720s.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="455.52" data-end="462.52"> So really a long time ago, these folks have been gone, but apparently a few of them could still produce the paperwork,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="462.52" data-end="464.52"> which remember was very important to Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="464.52" data-end="469.52"> They were very guarded. So it was a rubable who rebuilt the temple about anybody coming in here and being like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="469.52" data-end="475.52"> oh, we have a claim to this thing and not being able to prove that they were children of the promise God made to Abraham.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="475.52" data-end="483.52"> But apparently the leaders were satisfied with what could be presented by this handful of Israelites who were around.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="483.52" data-end="489.52"> And we don't get a list of who those Israelites were. I mean, we're going to get a list here of the descendants of Benjamin</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="489.52" data-end="495.52"> and the descendants of Judah and the priests and the Levites and even the gatekeepers.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="495.52" data-end="501.52"> But then there's one more verse as we scroll ahead here to verse 20 of Nehemiah 11 that says,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="501.52" data-end="508.52"> the rest of the Israelites with the priests and the Levites were in all the towns of Judah, each on his ancestral property.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="508.52" data-end="514.52"> It's interesting though, because the descendants of the Israelites, all of their ancestral property would have been in the north,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="514.52" data-end="527.52"> but if you go and you look at a map of the satrapi of beyond the river, that is the Persian province in which all of this is happening,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="527.52" data-end="534.52"> it isn't drawn neatly over the top of the ancient boundary markers of the divisions between Israel and Judah in the north and the south,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="534.52" data-end="542.52"> the Persians drew the lines very differently. So it's true, the ancestral homelands of the ancient northern kingdom of Israel,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="542.52" data-end="548.52"> anybody who was still somehow alive and had carved out some sort of continuous heritage from that time,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="548.52" data-end="553.52"> their homelands would still be there within the boundaries of this province.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="553.52" data-end="559.52"> But the author of Ezra and Nehemiah doesn't seem very interested in giving a whole bunch of details about that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="560.52" data-end="565.52"> And I think the reason would appear to be that the author of Ezra and Nehemiah, who looks to be Ezra,</p>
