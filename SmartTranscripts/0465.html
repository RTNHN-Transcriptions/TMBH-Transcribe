        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="29.5"> Question. Are you allowed to purge a temple? Jesus was allowed to do it. He went right into Jerusalem in Matthew 21 verses 12 through 13 and he just straight up purged a temple, dude. Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables and money changers and the benches of those who were selling dubs. And then he said, it's written my house will be called the house of prayer, but you're making it into a den of robbers.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="29.5" data-end="59.3"> And then everybody's really excited about it right after that. Nobody's like, jerk, where do you get off? And I'm like, no, that pretty much made sense. That seemed like probably what needed to be done. And like, you were probably the right guy to do it. But what about the actual moral example for you and me? That would seem to be the last outstanding question. Now, maybe you've heard people invoke this passage in conversations that you've observed about civil disobedience or how much protesting.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="59.3" data-end="89.1"> We ought to do or what protesting ought to look like or whether it's okay if somebody's really, really, really wrong to physically hurt them or to smash up their stuff. And if you have heard it invoked in those kind of conversations, maybe you've come away scratching your head like, pan, it's just weird though, because all the other things that Jesus did weren't like this. But then you get this one. And it's like, you can pretend that this wasn't in the Bible. I mean, it's own all four of the guys.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="89.1" data-end="94.89999999999999"> Or the gospels, maybe even happened twice depending on how you read John's rendering of it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="94.89999999999999" data-end="101.5"> How you read it? There's at least one cleansing of the temple, maybe two that Jesus engages in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="101.5" data-end="112.1"> And it's written about in every account of Jesus life. So man, it makes sense, I guess, that the people who are going to be like, man, some violence is a really good idea.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="112.1" data-end="118.89999999999999"> If you're a Christian, sometimes things are just so screwed up, bro, that you just got to smash some things and like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="118.9" data-end="132.1"> look, hey, sister, sometimes you're going to go into a situation that is so unjust and so wrong and you're just going to know that it's wrong that you might actually need to hurt some people or fashion a whip and hurt people because Jesus did it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="132.1" data-end="139.9"> Is that compelling though? Is that satisfying to you? For me, man, it doesn't go down quite right.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="139.9" data-end="145.9"> That rationale for using this passage to be like some violence in the name of God is probably a good idea.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="145.9" data-end="152.9"> You just, the needle scratches on the record a little bit. So I want to explore that for a second here before we move on to the next passage next time around.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.9" data-end="165.9"> Here's what I think the big difference is between Bobby and Kyle going out to destroy some stuff in the name of God or hurt some people in the name of God because they saw some things other people were doing that they thought were wrong or a bad idea.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.9" data-end="175.9"> The big difference between them and Jesus is that, well, it's them and Jesus. Like the Jesus who is described in the Bible is the infinite.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="175.9" data-end="191.9"> He fully participated in creation. I mean, just one chapter earlier in John, Jesus is described as the word of God, like the logos, the word incarnate knowledge and ordered thought incarnate.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="191.9" data-end="200.9"> Then nothing that's been made has been made apart from him and he is light and that's pretty transcendent. Nobody ever said that about Kyle. Nothing personal, Kyle.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="200.9" data-end="207.9"> I think you're great, but I don't know. I don't really view you as being transcendent over time and creation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="207.9" data-end="219.9"> I don't really view you as that one wise philosopher leader that stepped out of the darkened cave into the light and saw what truth was and then went back to recover everybody else from the darkness to bring them into the light.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="219.9" data-end="223.9"> But the darkness didn't understand you, Kyle. It's just not quite like that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="223.9" data-end="232.9"> And so right off the bat, I think contrast number one that we need to draw here is we need to acknowledge the possibility that Jesus does some stuff in the Bible, the WWJD.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="232.9" data-end="247.9"> What would Jesus do? 1997 yellow bracelet just cannot account for give your out on the sea and you see a bunch of your friends from shore who are being washed back and forth and it looks like they might die in the boat accident.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="247.9" data-end="261.9"> You might have lots of recourses at your disposal, but what would Jesus do? Well, we know that what Jesus would do is just defy the laws of time and space and walk out there on the water and like teach him a lesson real quick about like faith and God, now things are.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="261.9" data-end="267.9"> And then maybe calm the storm. Like that's what Jesus would do. But what would Kyle do? Nothing personal, Kyle. I think you're great. What would Kyle do?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="267.9" data-end="282.9"> Kyle would call the police or like the boat patrol. I don't know if there was a boat patrol. I'm not around lakes a lot. I don't know. You don't have the options. You don't have the same stuff at your disposal that Jesus had.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="282.9" data-end="291.9"> You don't have the same powers. You don't have the same knowledge. And in this case, especially, you just don't have the same capacity for judgment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="291.9" data-end="313.9"> You're not in a place of absolutely log free, spec free eyes. That's a reference back to Matthew, Chapter seven. You don't have the ability of having clear sight to see everything and take everything into account, almost an infinite number of factors to look at someone else's behavior and motives and soul and be like, I see with absolute certainty exactly what is going on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="313.9" data-end="331.9"> Jesus does have that capacity and it would seem in a justifiable righteous anger, justifiable, not because I also see how bad that coin changing was. I mean, it seems exploitative and bad, but I don't know for sure. Like, if you shouldn't do that or not, I'm just not positive. Seems dumb.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="331.9" data-end="342.9"> But Jesus looks at it. He's like, I know exactly what's going on here. I know why it's going on. I know why this is screwed up. I'm right in all of my judgments. This is my father's house and I'm purging this crap. And then he does it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="342.9" data-end="360.9"> That isn't the same if Rita or Kyle do it. And the reason is because they could be wrong. Now, look, in this particular example, you don't have an immediate impending physical victim. It's not like the money changers are looming over an orphan with a dagger</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="360.9" data-end="374.9"> raised on high with both hands. And then Jesus bullet right through the back and money changer stabbers slowly sloughs off to the side. And the orphan gets up and is like, gee, thanks, Mr. And Jesus is like, don't mention it. That's just what I do.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="374.9" data-end="386.9"> It's not like we're talking about an impending danger situation where Jesus intervened and stopped this violent crisis from occurring. This had been going on for a long time. This really was status quo.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="386.9" data-end="398.9"> So you get this weird mingling to of like, well, it's not that urgent. There's not like this impending thing that means you have to do this right this second or this horrible violent atrocity is going to occur.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="398.9" data-end="414.9"> This is more of an institutional evil that it evolved over time. You know what institutional evils are. Remember, because of how you live around them every single day because you just watch them unfold in front of your face on the news every single day.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="414.9" data-end="429.9"> Institutional evil just kind of happens. You don't even really have to help it. We all have culpability in it. It's just out there and it's going on. And one of the real defense mechanisms against institutional evil is just to be like, well, come on, we do this. Why wouldn't we also do that?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="429.9" data-end="443.9"> It's lazy awful morality, but that technique is effective because it delays a robust response. Well, for whatever reason, today was the day that Jesus walked in and he's here and he's making a messiness.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="443.9" data-end="454.9"> And he's making a messianic claim and he looks around and he's like the usual play here would be to say, why purge it today? Why confront this today? We've been doing this forever. Why is it so wrong today when it was apparently fine yesterday?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="454.9" data-end="464.9"> But Jesus and his infinite correct judgment that Kyle Rita and me, Matt, Matt Whitman completely lack. He looks at it and is like, today is the day of judgment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="464.9" data-end="478.9"> And this is really the only reckoning that occurs in his entire trip to Jerusalem. Everybody is looking forward to the reckoning. They wanted to see this thing get resolved. They're even looking forward to a reckoning after Jesus has been crucified and resurrected in Acts chapter 1.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="478.9" data-end="484.9"> And they're like, oh, now, now we're going to have the whole reckoning thing with Jerusalem. Are we going to restore it? And Jesus is like, no, we're going to do all that later on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="484.9" data-end="495.9"> This is really as close as we come at any point in the text of the gospels to a reckoning. And it's very, very short. And it's almost like, look, you can, you all can do whatever you want to me.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="495.9" data-end="502.9"> And I know you're an emergency. I know what it's going to feel like and everything. But you can't mess with my father. I'm just, I'm not going to put up with that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="502.9" data-end="510.9"> What you're doing without any doubt or question because I'm Jesus and all my judgments are right is utter blasphemy and evil and it won't be happening here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="510.9" data-end="519.9"> And further, it looks like Jesus is saying, well, you can do whatever you want to me. I mean, Son of Man didn't come to be served but to serve and give his life and ransom for many.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="519.9" data-end="528.9"> Like stuff's going to happen to me. I get it. That works. But I do have a problem with what you're doing to the little children because I tell you the truth that unless you change and become like these little children,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="528.9" data-end="532.9"> you never going to enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, wherever humbles himself like this child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="532.9" data-end="544.9"> And whoever welcomes a little child in my name welcomes me. But anyway, who causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin. It'd be better for him to have a large millstone on around his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="544.9" data-end="549.9"> Matthew 18, like two through six. It's small writing. It's hard for me to say from here. And so it looks like Jesus is like I'm prepared to take it on the chin, but I'm going to defend the pilgrim, the innocent, the little child in terms of faith from the monstrosities, the evil, the</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="549.9" data-end="573.9"> injustice that's occurring here. I'm going to break down this barrier that is occurring that you are putting up this impediment that you're making between those little children and God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="573.9" data-end="592.9"> No, respect my father. This is his house. What are you doing? I'm here and I'm going to address the thing. So I think there are a couple of layers to why Jesus is uniquely positioned to do this thing in terms of his skill set, his talent, his lack of limitations, his correctness and judgment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="592.9" data-end="612.9"> But I also think there are a couple of reasons that he's justified in doing these things in ways that we're not that are unique to the moment. What's being illustrated, what he's doing, this singular one time only deal that is God in the flesh on the planet resolving the human condition, rectifying</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="612.9" data-end="627.9"> these things. It's unique. And so what I see is just a matter of hours later, Peter tries to imitate Jesus and is like, Oh, are we wrecking stuff now? Like, are we hurting people and flipping over tables and breaking things because I crack circles.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="627.9" data-end="642.9"> That is kind of what I'm good at. So I have sword who wants to lose an ear and Peter in a minute, he's going to go swinging around swords and chopping off people's ears, trying to make point and be violent. And that'll end in his embarrassment and humiliation and we'll get to that later on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="642.9" data-end="658.9"> Jesus is quick to say, no, we're not doing that. What seems pretty evident is that while Jesus demonstrates unbelievable restraint and not lashing out the killing people, bringing in angels to inflict judgment, smiting people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="658.9" data-end="670.9"> He resists all of that. He's here because the kingdom is of a different world. He represents the long sufferingness of God. He represents God's investment in the redemption of people and that which is broken.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="670.9" data-end="679.9"> And what I don't think we're seeing here is an exception to that by which he's like, well, we're not going to use violence to advance the kingdom unless you're really mad.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="679.9" data-end="687.9"> And for that, I just go back to Micah 6.8. I mean, think about if you had a chance to talk to God, what would be the questions you'd ask about this life?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="687.9" data-end="694.9"> I guess one of the top two or three for me would be like, what's my quest? What do you actually want me to do? What's the really, really big stuff here?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="694.9" data-end="703.9"> And the answer is right here, Micah 6.8. He showed you, man, what's good? What does the Lord require of you to act justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="703.9" data-end="719.9"> Huh? Okay. Well, mercy and justice sometimes require action. And so I think that is more of a justification for sometimes stepping into the fray, even being prepared to be hurt or lay down your own life or at great expense to yourself.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="719.9" data-end="729.9"> Do what is right and just with kingdom values and in the defense of justice or in the act of mercy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="729.9" data-end="748.9"> What I think we're seeing here with Jesus in Matthew 21 is something that is more messianic, more prophetic, more of an in-house issue with people who, by their actions, Jesus judged to be effectively rejecting the God who they claim to be worshiping and putting up an almost</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="748.9" data-end="756.9"> impenetrable impediment, keeping people from encountering the God who lived right there in that house, waiting for them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="756.9" data-end="765.9"> This is a little longer conversation today, and I'm content to let it be like that because I didn't write anything down. You're probably like, yeah, we can tell. You didn't write anything down. That was very evident.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="765.9" data-end="776.9"> But mostly I just wanted to process this thing through, for myself and with you because I do think it's a valid question. I do think we live in a time where the tension feels like it's ratcheting up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="776.9" data-end="790.9"> And where if we can find any justification, regardless of what teams we align with to go and take bold moves and even occasionally violent moves, we seem to be having no trouble finding justifications for that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="790.9" data-end="807.9"> And so I guess I would urge us to proceed with caution in using the example of Christ in this passage to justify such a thing. So he's doing the big brave, big swing stuff to make this thing happen. But clearly, what kingdom citizens are called to are kingdom values.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="807.9" data-end="814.9"> Make of that what you will, my friends. Kyle, I'm sorry for all the things I said about you in this episode.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="814.9" data-end="821.9"> I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.</p>
