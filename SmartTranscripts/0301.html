        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="7.2" data-end="11.4"> The place where I record. So the audio is going to be a little bit screwy on this one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="11.4" data-end="14.88"> Thanks in advance for your patience and we should be back to normal tomorrow.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="21.84" data-end="27.560000000000002"> When I was a kid, I was not the biggest, the most athletic or the best at things, but I like to try everything.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="27.56" data-end="31.96"> Everything looked fun and amazing. When you watch other people doing stuff, you're like,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="31.96" data-end="35.16"> Oh, it looks so easy and smooth and you do it and fun. I want to jump in.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="35.16" data-end="39.16"> And so I would jump in with everything and then I would lose horribly at all the things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="39.16" data-end="42.36"> I was like, not a little bit the smallest kid in school.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="42.36" data-end="47.56"> I was always especially in elementary school. I really the smallest kid in school.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="47.56" data-end="54.16"> And so you can imagine what the sympathetic teachers would say to try to encourage me as I got destroyed at everything.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="54.16" data-end="59.559999999999995"> They'd be like, Hey, you know, you might not be the biggest kid, but dynamite comes in small packages.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="59.76" data-end="63.16"> Remember that one? I always took it to heart. I was like, you know what it does.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="63.559999999999995" data-end="70.36"> That's a great point teacher. And I'm going to put that deep down in my heart and just store that up and lean into that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="70.56" data-end="76.16"> And then at some point as an adult, I was like, you know what dynamite comes in small packages to make myself feel a better.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="76.36" data-end="83.56"> It's like I'm going to Google that safe search Google that by the way, so that nobody can trace the dynamite search for packages of dynamite back to me.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="83.56" data-end="89.56"> And I looked at it. I was like, dang, those packages of dynamite are actually huge.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="90.36" data-end="95.36"> I had these huge vintage boxes that hold tons and tons of dynamite.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="95.56" data-end="108.36"> I feel like people maybe had never actually looked at a package of dynamite when they invented that particular saying, but hey, it made me and countless other not the biggest people feel better about things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="108.36" data-end="123.26"> So I will take it. But before the saying about dynamite comes in small packages floating around, Jesus had come up with another saying that roughly communicates the same meaning that appears in one of the littlest parables in the whole Bible.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.26" data-end="125.25999999999999"> One of these would be easy to forget.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="125.25999999999999" data-end="129.16"> I suppose it's in Matthew chapter 13 starting in verse 31.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.16" data-end="130.86"> Here's the whole thing is going to take two verses.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="130.86" data-end="131.86"> So buckle up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="132.36" data-end="133.56"> He told them another parable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="133.56" data-end="138.06"> The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="138.06" data-end="149.56"> Though it's the smallest of all the seeds yet when it grows up, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds come and perch in its branches of the end full stop.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="149.56" data-end="152.06"> I really don't think this one is all that tough.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.06" data-end="156.56"> He said the seed starts really, really small and then it grows up into something huge.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="156.56" data-end="173.06"> There's a little bit of controversy on the littlest side of things when it comes to this passage or some people are like, I googled it and much like you googled the dynamite packages and figured out that those packages are actually a little bit larger than is advertised from the encouraging things your teachers told you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="173.06" data-end="178.46"> So we looked into the size of mustard seeds and it turns out that's not literally the smallest seed of all the seeds.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="178.46" data-end="193.46"> I've heard people receive that very literalist verbal interpretive tennis serve and try to hit it back with a literalist return and be like, well, I think Jesus is talking about the smallest of all the seeds of all the garden plants because he's talking about garden plants.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="193.46" data-end="195.46"> That could be that may be a valid read.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="195.46" data-end="196.46"> I don't know.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="196.46" data-end="199.46"> I didn't do a lot of agronomy research on this one.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="199.46" data-end="207.46"> That could be a satisfactory way to look at another satisfactory way to deal with that tension might be to just say, I don't know, it's a metaphor inside of a metaphor.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="207.46" data-end="214.46"> He's talking about a seed that would have conjured the meaning of a very small seed in the mind of his audience.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="214.46" data-end="221.46"> And he's talking to a specific audience and apparently at work, somebody wrote this down and it stood the test of time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="221.46" data-end="224.46"> I don't know, whatever the case, the metaphor is not that confusing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="224.46" data-end="230.46"> For the third parable in a row, you've got this little tiny seed, this packet of data that looks like nothing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="230.46" data-end="239.46"> In the first of the three parables that deal with scattering seeds, there's this indiscriminate scattering and as you would expect, it doesn't always take.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="239.46" data-end="243.46"> And in some places, it does take and it produces this great harvest.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="243.46" data-end="247.46"> Then we zoom in a little bit closer to the second parable of Matthew 13.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="247.46" data-end="251.46"> This is the one about the wheat and the tears that we spent all last week talking about.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.46" data-end="255.46"> And there we get a closer look at just the place where it took and it worked out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="255.46" data-end="271.46000000000004"> But then an enemy comes along and tries to wreck it and ultimately that parable turns out not to be so much about the good seed that was sown, but the similar seed that got sown alongside it and the chaos and the damage that come from that and the levelheadedness</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="271.46000000000004" data-end="275.46000000000004"> and cool long view perspective of the master in the story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="275.46000000000004" data-end="280.46000000000004"> Well, this time, the thing that we're zooming in on is just the smallness of the seed.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="280.46000000000004" data-end="283.46000000000004"> It's such a little thing with such great consequence.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="283.46" data-end="293.46"> So imagine what it felt like for the original audience, either the ones who are right here on the Sea of Galilee listening to these parables being taught.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="293.46" data-end="294.46"> I mean, it's the first century.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="294.46" data-end="296.46"> We've got Jesus on a boat.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="296.46" data-end="303.46"> You can maybe see the roof of the synagogue, the symbol of religious authority off in the distance.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="303.46" data-end="312.46"> You could look south across the water and see Tiberius, a significant city with a Roman occupational presence named for an emperor.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="312.46" data-end="314.46"> For an emperor of Rome.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="314.46" data-end="328.46"> And here's all these people from all these different backgrounds gathered around this guy who is teaching again now at the foot of the place where he did his big kingdom manifesto, which was literally just up the hill from where he's doing this speech now out in the water.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="328.46" data-end="330.46"> And up on the hill, he was really literal about it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="330.46" data-end="337.46"> And down here, he's being very figurative about it, but you add up the sum of it and you feel like this, the Jesus stuff, the kingdom stuff is compelling.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="337.46" data-end="338.46"> It's good.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="338.46" data-end="339.46"> It's interesting.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="339.46" data-end="355.46"> It seems like it's true and it's real and I just as much as I like you, Jesus, as much as your eyes are super dreamy and your beard is the best of all the beards and as much as me, just some random member in the crowd here watching you talk from the boat, as much as I might not even be able to explain away some of the miraculous stuff that you can do.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="355.46" data-end="359.46"> And I'm really compelled by that as much as all of that might be true.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="359.46" data-end="368.46"> I just don't see how this little tiny thing with this little very unofficial movement could grow into something of much significance.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="368.46" data-end="369.46"> I mean, it has a glass ceiling.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="369.46" data-end="379.46"> Look, there's the synagogue of religion that's pushing a couple thousand years old and there's a city that's reflective of the greatest, most powerful empire earth has ever seen.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="379.46" data-end="380.46"> This is quaint.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="380.46" data-end="381.46"> This is nice.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="381.46" data-end="384.46"> I like this talk about your kingdom, but I can't imagine how it's going to work out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="384.46" data-end="391.46"> Well, remember the kingdom parables of Matthew 13 are about characterizing how the kingdom is going to unfold.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="391.46" data-end="398.46"> So in the first one, yeah, a lot of people aren't going to sign up for this, but those who do and in whom this takes deep root.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="398.46" data-end="402.46"> Amazing things are going to come out of it. They're going to produce this incredible harvest.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="402.46" data-end="410.46"> And then the second one, yep, there's opposition there, enemies that are going to want to wreck this thing, but the king, the master has this long view over all of it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="410.46" data-end="412.46"> And in the end, it gets resolved. It gets worked out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="412.46" data-end="420.46"> Well, if you think about those two parables in light of this one little tiny short one, it could maybe give that honest skeptic in the audience who has the reservations.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="420.46" data-end="422.46"> I just described a little bit of pause.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="422.46" data-end="426.46"> Maybe that person goes home after hearing the shortest of all of these parables in here.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="426.46" data-end="430.46"> It's like, you know what, that one really stuck with me because of the first parable is true.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="430.46" data-end="440.46"> And it only takes a very tiny minority of the good soil producing a return of 30, 60, 100, whatever it is.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="440.46" data-end="455.46"> That would put it on an exponential growth curve pretty quickly. And further, even with these opponents to the values of the kingdom visibly with their symbols inside the religious establishment political establishment.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="455.46" data-end="465.46"> I mean, the parable of the wheat and the tears out for enemies and pushback and sabotage and destructiveness.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="465.46" data-end="468.46"> It looks like that is addressable as well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="468.46" data-end="485.46"> Maybe that earnest onlooker standing on the shore trying to figure out what to make of Jesus thinks about this a little longer and they're like, you know, I guess, if something like this were to start, there are only two ways for it to start with a gigantic bang where it gets huge immediately</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="485.46" data-end="492.46"> and everybody's blown away or like most things start really small and unassuming and seeming like it's not going to work out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="492.46" data-end="500.46"> And it's kind of interesting because whether you're talking about the original audience member or you and me if they thought further about this parable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="500.46" data-end="504.46"> This parable also kind of reflects back on the initiation of the kingdom.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="504.46" data-end="508.46"> I mean, how did it show up? Not with the heavens parting.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="508.46" data-end="523.46"> And Jesus wearing the full golden Wonder Woman 1984 style eagle armor comes flying out of the clouds on some celestial Pegasus war horse with his sword a blazing and fire in his eyes.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="523.46" data-end="528.46"> And he lands the super hero landing. He's like, weaklings of earth, bend the knee before your new master.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="530.46" data-end="532.46"> I think that would be the splashy way to do it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="532.46" data-end="534.46"> But instead he shows up as a little baby.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="534.46" data-end="540.46"> And instead of it being so obvious as I bang, you have to follow him or else you'll kill me with his eye lasers.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="540.46" data-end="556.46"> Instead, there's this slow patient values of the kingdom oriented opportunity to reflect on what God said in the past, what we've seen God do in the past, who this little baby is, how that lines up.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="556.46" data-end="568.46"> And this little baby's grown up. Now what this adult guy is doing and saying and how he teaches and what he's up to. So I suppose this simple little mustard seed parable on the one level just explains how the kingdom is going to work out.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="568.46" data-end="574.46"> This we're not going to do the splashy thing right now. We're going to do the really subtle thing and it grows up into something gigantic.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="574.46" data-end="578.46"> You guys can all picture things that start tiny and grow up into something gigantic.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="578.46" data-end="588.46"> And at the secondary level, it serves as a little bit of a breather in a series of very complex parables to give people something they can really sink their teeth into and consider all of this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="588.46" data-end="592.46"> It gives them an opportunity gives you and me an opportunity to do the math on the big picture.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="592.46" data-end="602.46"> If God showed up and intervened in the physical world and was bringing about some kind of redemption, what actually would that look like?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="602.46" data-end="606.46"> And how does that square with the stuff we've seen, the stuff that we've been reading about?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="606.46" data-end="609.46"> This parable were the only thing in the Bible. I would not be a Christian.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="609.46" data-end="617.46"> The idea that things start small and get bigger is not nearly compelling enough in and of itself that caused me to be like, yeah, that's the one true religion.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="617.46" data-end="619.46"> I am totally signing up. No.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="619.46" data-end="635.46"> But in the context of everything else that's going on here, it really does give us this interesting philosophical beat in the unfolding of this discourse where we have the opportunity to stop and think big picture about what we've seen and heard so far.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="635.46" data-end="644.46"> And where this thing is going and if that looks like the stuff that you would expect, if God were to do a big redemptive plan and initiate a kingdom.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="644.46" data-end="660.46"> And again, finally, from a narrative perspective, we see yet another parable in Matthew 13 that also serves the purpose of tempering and refining the expectations of the audience that they were thinking, well, God is going to show up with the sword and everything's going to become obvious.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="660.46" data-end="667.46"> Instead, they're seeing the blind received sight mute and speak. The deaf can hear the prisoners are set free.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="667.46" data-end="683.46"> There's two sets of expectations going on there. This kind of thing serves as a corrective away from the expectations people might intuitively have and points them back toward the expectations held out by the prophets and the text and the trajectory of the work of God in the past.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="683.46" data-end="691.46"> We get another teeny tiny little parable tomorrow that deals with a similar theme with the different twists and we'll have fun unpacking that one as well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="691.46" data-end="698.46"> Hey, I saw that a few of you jumped on and signed up at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast to support the program.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="698.46" data-end="704.46"> It doesn't matter at what level you signed up for. Like cheap is fine. It doesn't matter. I'm grateful for all of it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="704.46" data-end="718.46"> But I am making progress on this really cool little field notes journal thing with the TmbH logo and then it says Matthew on there. And I'm going to send that to literally every patron when I have the thing done and published and ready to go out here in a couple of weeks.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="718.46" data-end="727.46"> So I'm excited to share that with you and I'm busted my butt to make this thing look cool so it's something fun that you can drag around, use for whatever you would use it for or use it as a cool little.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="727.46" data-end="738.46"> There's like the one big thought for the day that I want to take with me kind of journal. You could put dates and episode numbers in and passages in and kind of keep track of the journey that we're going on together through this text.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="738.46" data-end="743.46"> So as my little idea and now the cats out of the bag. That's what I'm going to send y'all. I think it's pretty neat.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="743.46" data-end="749.46"> So if you want to jump in on the patreon thing, you can do that at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="749.46" data-end="755.46"> Literally everybody who signed up is going to get one of those things and we will start getting those out here in a couple of weeks.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="755.46" data-end="760.46"> Thanks so much for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.</p>
