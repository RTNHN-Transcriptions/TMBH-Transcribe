        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="0.0" data-end="4.0"> Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="12.0"> We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Second Timothy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="18.0" data-end="25.0"> Second Timothy is the last letter we're aware of that Paul ever wrote, and it reads like it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="25.0" data-end="31.0"> It's heavy, it's weighty, it's human, it's emotional, there's a passing of the baton,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="31.0" data-end="34.0"> and also there's a piece to it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="34.0" data-end="37.0"> Paul feels good about what he used his life on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="37.0" data-end="41.0"> He still doesn't think, even as he's sitting in this freezing cold Roman prison,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="41.0" data-end="44.0"> he still doesn't think that there's anything better he could have used his time on,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="44.0" data-end="49.0"> and he's exhorting the recipient of the letter, young Timothy, his protege,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="49.0" data-end="52.0"> to see it the same way and to follow suit.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="52.0" data-end="62.0"> The guy who taught me the Old Testament and first introduced me deeply to the idea that the Bible was rooted in history</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="62.0" data-end="65.0"> and said in history, real people, real places, real times.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="65.0" data-end="71.0"> The first time that history and academics really overlapped with the Bible for me was in this guy's classes</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.0" data-end="79.0"> in my undergraduate education. His name was Samir Masu, he was a Lebanese dude, he was phenomenal in terms of his abilities,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="79.0" data-end="86.0"> in terms of his talent for communication, and in terms of his personal conduct, how he treated people.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="86.0" data-end="98.0"> I deeply, profoundly respected this guy, and just a couple years back, I called him with some questions about the Bible for things you and I talk about here,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="98.0" data-end="101.0"> and I could sense in his voice that he was not doing well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="101.0" data-end="105.0"> I found out later that he was very, very sick when we had spoken.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="105.0" data-end="111.0"> We talked, he offered me some really helpful feedback that made its way again into the conversation you and I had,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.0" data-end="116.0"> and then as we're getting ready to jump off the phone, he totally switched gears, completely different tone.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="116.0" data-end="123.0"> I don't know if it was off the cuff or if he thought about it in advance or if maybe he had done this with some other people in his life,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="123.0" data-end="129.0"> but he gave me this incredibly meaningful blessing and commissioning.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="129.0" data-end="137.0"> I didn't see it coming. Fortunately, I had the good sense to just keep my mouth shut and listen very closely to try to receive it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="137.0" data-end="142.0"> And then we say goodbye, and that was the last time I ever talked to him. He passed away shortly thereafter.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="142.0" data-end="147.0"> It feels like what we're getting in 2 Timothy is that same kind of thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="147.0" data-end="154.0"> It's a closing blessing, it's a closing exhortation, it's a taking of the baton, and a handing off of that to say,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="154.0" data-end="158.0"> now you take it and you run with it with the fullness of my blessing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="158.0" data-end="161.0"> And so when we get to the end of this letter, I'm just going to tell you in advance,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="161.0" data-end="164.0"> I feel very strongly that if you're compelled by what you see in the Bible,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="164.0" data-end="172.0"> by what you see in the New Testament, that maybe you just kind of owe it to Paul to read this whole thing from beginning to end.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="172.0" data-end="177.0"> And maybe with your antenna out for what part of this blessing is maybe transferable to you,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="177.0" data-end="184.0"> what part of this might have been written with future audiences, with you in mind to receive what's in it as well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="184.0" data-end="189.0"> I like this one, and I got a soft spot for it. The structure of it is really simple.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="189.0" data-end="194.0"> Point number one is he's reflecting on his life, and he's saying this is the way I want to deliver it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="194.0" data-end="200.0"> I wouldn't do it any other way. Big time paraphrase his mind there, but it's faithful to what he's communicating.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="200.0" data-end="203.0"> And he's thankful to God for helping him to see it through.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="203.0" data-end="209.0"> He's thankful to God for his faithfulness, and he's exhorting Timothy not to be ashamed of Jesus</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="209.0" data-end="213.0"> and also not to be ashamed of his spiritual father, Paul.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="213.0" data-end="219.0"> Apparently a lot of people had been like, well, Paul, if you're right, how come God keeps letting you get in prison?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="219.0" data-end="225.0"> I'm not going to hang around with that and take the social punishment that comes from associating with you.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="225.0" data-end="229.0"> This is a human phenomenon we still see today when people get in trouble on the Internet,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="229.0" data-end="234.0"> and everybody goes underground real quick and gets real, real quiet because they don't want the bad vibes</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="234.0" data-end="239.0"> of however one individual ran afoul of everyone on the Internet to rub off on them.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="239.0" data-end="245.0"> The same thing was happening back then. Paul was lonely. He says at the end of his letter that only Luke has remained with them,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="245.0" data-end="251.0"> and he wants Timothy to get ahead of the weather because it's wintertime and get there to see him.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.0" data-end="256.0"> But in all of that, in the opening of this letter, Paul is saying Christ is faithful.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="256.0" data-end="262.0"> Timothy remained faithful to Christ. Make that the centerpiece of your life moving forward.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="262.0" data-end="268.0"> In the second part of the book, Paul deals with a few practical things still dealing with ongoing problems and Ephesus.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="268.0" data-end="274.0"> First Timothy was maybe written three, four, maybe as many as five years earlier.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="274.0" data-end="282.0"> And despite Timothy's efforts, it looks like there were still problems, particularly there were still problems with people denying the existence of resurrection,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="282.0" data-end="288.0"> denying the existence of this future hope of life in Christ, or maybe just suggesting that the resurrection already happened,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="288.0" data-end="292.0"> and it's already over with. Either way, the result is the same.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="292.0" data-end="299.0"> It's making for a weird, ineffective faith and a bad read on the Scriptures or even a disregard for the Scriptures.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="299.0" data-end="303.0"> As Paul is like, hey, Timothy, you've got to point people back to that stuff.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="303.0" data-end="308.0"> All Scripture is God breathed. It's wildly useful for a whole stack of things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="308.0" data-end="315.0"> And all of that stuff that Scripture does is meant to make the man of God, the woman of God, thoroughly equipped for every good work,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="315.0" data-end="318.0"> and Ephesus could use a dose of that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="318.0" data-end="323.0"> And then in the final chapter, Paul says, look, people are not going to like the things that you have to say.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="323.0" data-end="328.0"> You being a faithful representative of Jesus is going to be provocative and an irritant.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="328.0" data-end="332.0"> It's okay. Be steadfast. Stay in it. Nothing matters more.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="332.0" data-end="338.0"> And then he gets into those really personal greetings that I've talked about a bit throughout our conversation here,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="338.0" data-end="345.0"> including things as specific as like, hey, Timothy, it's very cold in this prison and we're headed into Roman winter.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="345.0" data-end="351.0"> Would you bring my coat? And also I have a stack of scrolls that I left in Troas.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="351.0" data-end="355.0"> Would you grab those as well? And again, please hurry. The weather's changing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="355.0" data-end="359.0"> I don't want you to get delayed by weather because I might not ever get to see you again.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="359.0" data-end="363.0"> If Paul has a feeling this is it. And indeed, this was it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="363.0" data-end="367.0"> He was executed in Rome shortly after writing this letter.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="367.0" data-end="371.0"> When you visualize the book of 2 Timothy, picture a cold prison.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="371.0" data-end="379.0"> When you think about the theme, reflect on the dangerous, meaningful life in service of Christ that Paul had lived</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="379.0" data-end="384.0"> and the invitation that he gives to Timothy, and I think by proxy us to follow suit.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="384.0" data-end="388.0"> Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, please make time to read the whole thing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="388.0" data-end="394.0"> I think Paul has earned the dignity of being thoroughly heard out in these final thoughts,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="394.0" data-end="397.0"> and I think you'll find it to be very meaningful as well.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="397.0" data-end="400.0"> All right, there we go. That's 2 Timothy Achievement Unlocked.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="400.0" data-end="403.0"> Next time around, we're on to the Book of Titus.</p>
