        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="35.879999999999995" data-end="37.28"> And that we're actually doing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="37.64" data-end="39.16"> So we're just going to need to get after it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="39.44" data-end="57.44"> We're in the Amiah chapter eight, but we're in one of those parts in the Amiah chapter eight and one of those parts of the seasons that we do where it takes us on this rabbit trail all through other parts of the Bible, which I think is super handy because then we learn together how the Bible all fits together, how it all works together, how it's all cohesive in Nehemiah chapter eight.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="57.68" data-end="62.16"> We are seeing an event that is occurring on September 27th, 444 BC.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="62.4" data-end="74.56"> And it is a great assembly of all of the people, all of the living descendants of Abraham, sometimes called the Jews, the Hebrews, the Israelites throughout the lengthy Old Testament story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="74.56" data-end="78.0"> And now here they are all gathered together back in Jerusalem.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="78.2" data-end="82.24"> The temple's been rebuilt after it was destroyed a century and a half earlier.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="88.8" data-end="94.52"> And it looks as though the way we're going to do it is we're going to call a great big assembly of everybody.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="94.75999999999999" data-end="100.47999999999999"> We're going to re-familiarize ourselves with the covenant, the deal with God, the law of God.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="100.8" data-end="109.67999999999999"> And then we're going to make a big, loud public proclamation in front of everybody that we are all going to honor the covenant and the commands of God moving forward.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="109.68" data-end="111.60000000000001"> It looks like that's how it's shaping up here in Nehemiah eight.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="111.60000000000001" data-end="112.48"> That's what we're going to find.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="112.88000000000001" data-end="130.96"> But before we get into all of the events of September 27th, 444 BC, you and I have been going back and looking over the last few days at the other great assemblies of Old Testament passages passed over the previous 1800 years of history of the descendants of Abraham.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="131.32" data-end="139.60000000000002"> And what we've seen so far is that before September 27th, 444 BC here in Nehemiah eight, there was another great assembly, a little less than a hundred years ago.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="139.68" data-end="151.84"> And a hundred years earlier in Ezra chapter three, that one was led by Zarubable and Jeshua son of Josodak after the sacrificial system was resumed.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="152.12" data-end="165.8"> Then we went back, not quite another hundred years to the very end of the southern kingdom of Judah in 2 Kings 22 and 23 into the era of the reign of good king Josiah and saw that he rediscovered the book of the law.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="165.8" data-end="166.68"> It broke his heart.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="166.84" data-end="171.32"> He called everybody together and there was a great big assembly to say, this is what the book of the law says.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="171.32" data-end="172.24"> We should be doing that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="172.24" data-end="173.16"> Why are we doing that?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="173.16" data-end="174.12"> Guys, you want to do that?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="174.12" data-end="176.24"> And everyone was like, yes, we should do that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="176.52" data-end="181.32"> But ultimately it proves to be too little too late and that becomes or comes and destroys everything anyway.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="181.56" data-end="196.32"> Then after that, we went back way, way further from the 600s ish BC, which is where we're at with the King Josiah assembly all the way back to the 1400 ish, maybe 1200 ish.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="196.32" data-end="202.28"> BC to the events at the end of the life of Joshua in Joshua 24.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="202.56" data-end="211.88"> And we see there that the occasion that has caused Joshua to call everybody together, all the living descendants of Abraham there is that they've just got done conquering the promised land.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="211.88" data-end="216.64"> They conquered Canaan and now the land is divided up and the tribes are going to go set up shop.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="216.64" data-end="221.35999999999999"> But Joshua's like, hey, real quick, like before we do that, you remember everything God did, right?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="221.35999999999999" data-end="223.84"> And how we got here and how he broke the laws of time and space.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="223.84" data-end="238.44"> And now this isn't just another one of these little regional squabbles between tribes, the actual God of actual everything showed up and did miraculous stuff to make it clear that he's the real one and that he should be followed by us and we should take this seriously.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="238.72" data-end="244.2"> And I don't know what y'all are going to do, but as for me in my house, we're going to serve the Lord and everybody's like, we're totally going to do that too.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="244.4" data-end="246.08"> And then Joshua was like, are you though?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="246.16" data-end="247.0"> But really?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="247.24" data-end="249.4"> And then they're like, no, we actually mean it this time.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="249.4" data-end="250.88"> And Joshua was like, okay, dokey.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="251.36" data-end="252.36"> Well, you probably should.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="252.36" data-end="253.84"> And everybody's like, we totally are.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="253.84" data-end="255.84"> And Josh was like, all right, I'm going to make a rock.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="256.12" data-end="257.24"> I'm going to carve that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="257.28000000000003" data-end="258.0"> Are you guys sure?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="258.0" data-end="262.12"> Because once I carve it on here, I'm carving it right now.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="262.16" data-end="263.0"> Are you sure?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="263.12" data-end="265.88"> And they're all like, we are sure paraphrases mine.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="266.2" data-end="268.0"> So that's how that assembly went.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="268.24" data-end="269.68"> So now we're going to jump back.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="270.48" data-end="278.68"> Oh, a generation or two before that great assembly at Shechem that we read about in Joshua 24.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="278.92" data-end="284.0"> And this is one, this next great assembly of the Old Testament, of all the descendants,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="284.0" data-end="289.0"> living descendants of Abraham, is one that is sort of spread out over the entire book of Deuteronomy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="289.0" data-end="293.84000000000003"> So in some ways, you could say, basically, the whole book of Deuteronomy is another one of these.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="293.84000000000003" data-end="300.96000000000004"> And indeed, the source language behind the term Deuteronomy, which is, of course, not a word you and I use outside of this context.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="301.48" data-end="303.56"> It just doesn't come up in real life conversation.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="303.96" data-end="309.48"> You don't just have deuteronomical things that occur when you go to get coffee with a friend or whatever.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="309.48" data-end="312.0"> I mean, it's strictly comes up in a Bible context.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="312.36" data-end="314.8"> It means the second law giving.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="314.8" data-end="329.68"> So Deuteronomy is all about an assembly of the people where Moses is pulling them together and he's realized that generation one of the people who came out of exile, out of slavery in Egypt, they don't get it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="330.2" data-end="331.52"> They're going to wander in the desert.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="331.52" data-end="333.32"> They're probably going to die in the desert.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="333.40000000000003" data-end="335.2"> They're not going to see the promised land.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="335.2" data-end="336.56"> They did weird stuff.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="336.92" data-end="338.44"> They didn't believe they weren't faithful.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="338.44" data-end="340.36"> They didn't keep their end of the covenant.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="340.84000000000003" data-end="346.96000000000004"> And this new generation is coming along with scrappy, new, young, brave leaders.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="347.28000000000003" data-end="354.44"> And it's clear that this is the generation who will go out of the desert, wandering and into the promised land of Canaan.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="354.44" data-end="359.64"> And so Moses deems it necessary or God deems it necessary through Moses to get everybody</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="359.76" data-end="364.08"> together from this new generation and remind them of what God has done for them in the past.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="364.59999999999997" data-end="366.44"> Same pattern that Joshua went with.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="366.91999999999996" data-end="376.12"> And to make sure they understand the law, the covenant, the deal and the character of God via what the law says.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="376.12" data-end="379.32"> Because remember, the law isn't just about rules.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="379.64" data-end="381.12"> The law is also a story.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="389.64" data-end="395.28"> So in Deuteronomy chapter five, it's been a little bit of wandering and hiking in the first four chapters.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="395.28" data-end="398.28"> But then finally, Moses pulling this whole thing together.</p>
