        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="84.0" data-end="92.0"> There are a jillion ways that it adjusts and moves and tightens and relaxes and rolls to absorb that hit</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="92.0" data-end="96.0"> and minimize the damage you take from that contact.</p>
