        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="4.0" data-end="8.5"> Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="8.5" data-end="11.700000000000001"> We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Song of Solomon.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="23.0" data-end="28.6"> What to do with Song of Songs, or Song of Solomon, as it's sometimes called?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="28.6" data-end="30.6"> That's the book we're looking at today.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="30.6" data-end="32.4"> This is an oddball.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="32.4" data-end="37.800000000000004"> Well, at least at first glance it's an oddball, because it just looks like it's a collection of poetry</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="37.800000000000004" data-end="46.400000000000006"> about romance and deep passionate love, including physical attraction and physical intimacy.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="50.400000000000006" data-end="53.2"> It is exactly all of those things.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="53.2" data-end="58.800000000000004"> So why would that be in the Bible, which is a story about God's redemptive plan?</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="71.2" data-end="74.4"> sometimes it's called Song of Solomon, sometimes it's called Song of Songs.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="74.4" data-end="80.0"> The reason it's called Song of Solomon is the opening line, which is the Song of Songs,</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="81.7" data-end="85.2"> And of course, understandably, the most natural assumption when you look at that,</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="85.2" data-end="90.0"> and indeed this has been my assumption my whole life until my last few readings of this book</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="603.6" data-end="611.6"> So in that regard, I have to think the original audience would have read this as, at least in part, a contrast between</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="611.6" data-end="617.6"> the kind of love that was probably often celebrated at this time and romanticized like, oh, it's the king and this harem.</p>

        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="625.6" data-end="628.6"> But the contrast then would be like, is it though?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="628.6" data-end="630.6"> Because look at what these two have.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="630.6" data-end="634.6"> They might not have riches, they might not have all of this other stuff, but they have each other and they mean it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="634.6" data-end="636.6"> And there's no compulsion.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="636.6" data-end="638.6"> Listen to the way they talk about this.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="638.6" data-end="642.6"> This is the ideal of what love is really about.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="642.6" data-end="645.6"> But that brings us back to that big glaring question I threw out a little bit earlier on.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="645.6" data-end="647.6"> Why is this in the Bible?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="647.6" data-end="659.6"> I think I'm content to say it's in the Bible because this is wisdom literature and wisdom literature deals with the reality of the lived experience of being a human in this world as God's redemptive plan is playing.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="659.6" data-end="661.6"> And this is a huge part of it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="661.6" data-end="663.6"> And this is a book that's dedicated to it.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="663.6" data-end="665.6"> Honestly, for me, that's enough.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="665.6" data-end="680.6"> But the idealization of love here does harken back to a time before everything got cheapened and wrecked by sin, a time that we looked at when we were going through the book of Genesis back at the very beginning.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="680.6" data-end="696.6"> Could this be intended as a nod, a yearning to when relationships could be even deeper and more profound and unbroken and even more naked and honest before each other, even more lasting?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="696.6" data-end="698.6"> Maybe that is present on these pages.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="698.6" data-end="703.6"> Is it some sort of metaphor for the love between God and his chosen people?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="703.6" data-end="710.6"> Or as Christians have often treated it as a metaphor for the love between Christ and his church?</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="710.6" data-end="711.6"> I don't think so.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="711.6" data-end="713.6"> It doesn't look like that overtly.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="713.6" data-end="729.6"> I suppose anytime though you see imagery depicting beautiful, profound, unflinching, deep love that withstands difficult tests that serves as a metaphor for the love between God and his people, the love of Christ for his church.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="729.6" data-end="733.6"> So I suppose it's there. I just don't see anything that overtly points to that.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="733.6" data-end="739.6"> Come on, if you've been going through the Bible with me, you know that I see things that are pointing to Jesus all over the place in the Old Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="739.6" data-end="742.6"> Here, I just don't think we have enough to say, oh, yeah, that's the purpose of the whole book.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="742.6" data-end="753.6"> And honestly, I think those interpretations over the centuries just came about because people were uncomfortable with the subject matter of the book and they wanted to do something to make it a little less giggly and uncomfortable.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="753.6" data-end="759.6"> We often lament the state of the world today and how bad things are, and I get it, I feel that sometimes too.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="759.6" data-end="775.6"> But maybe one of the benefits of this odd little moment we live in is that we're better positioned to appreciate this for what it looks like it was intended originally to be, which at its core is a celebration of God's generous gift of love and physical intimacy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="775.6" data-end="777.6"> I know I am grateful for those gifts.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="777.6" data-end="786.6"> When you visualize Song of Songs, picture a young, beautiful shepherdess and her young, handsome shepherd lover embracing near their flocks.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="786.6" data-end="791.6"> When you think about the point, think about a celebration of love, attraction, and physical intimacy.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="791.6" data-end="794.6"> And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, find a way.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="794.6" data-end="800.6"> Because this one really needs to be read, beginning to end to appreciate it, and it's a pretty quick read and a pretty profound read.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="800.6" data-end="809.6"> And with that, double achievement unlocked because we not only just finished Song of Solomon, but we also just completed the wisdom literature section of the Old Testament.</p>
        
        <p onclick="seekToTime(event)" class="transcript-section" data-start="809.6" data-end="813.6"> And next time around, we're on to the Prophets and the Book of Isaiah.</p>
