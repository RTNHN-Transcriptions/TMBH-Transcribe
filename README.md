# TMBH_Transcribe

To test out the SmartTranscripts, you can go to https://esther004.tiiny.site/

With the SmartTranscripts, the text color will follow along with the audio. Also, you can click on any of the blocks of text and the audio will automatically go to that part. It is super basic and minimalist, but it is more of a proof of concept.

You can also see all the transcriptions here: http://tmbh-transcribe.github.io/TMBH-Transcribe/
