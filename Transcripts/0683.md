 Oh, my name's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. And I believe on other occasions, I've talked to you about my family's morbid enjoyment of videos where things go horribly wrong on the internet. And I believe I've also told you before that we have a particular affinity for the instant karma genre of fail videos. That's the one where someone behaves in a way they probably shouldn't. And then just immediately it boomerangs on them. Like somebody goes to kick a dog on some wet pavement. I saw this one the other day because the pavement's wet and they have to go to the one leg. They kick it. The standing leg goes out from under them and boom, they fall down and the dog doesn't get kicked. And you're like, that's just, that's fantastic. Or the person who behaves like a jerk in their car, then is shaking their fist at people and being rude. I'm super sanitizing this for the youngsters. And then they zip ahead to make a point about how angry and inconvenienced they are. They immediately like drive into a pole or something. You get the idea. Well, this instant karma, instant regret genre is one that's built into the Bible. Whether you're new to the Bible and Christianity and all of these stories or whether you've been around them for a long time, you can still probably think of a few of these off the top of your head. Like the super famous one is what happens in the Exodus, right? Pharaoh's like, we got to get these Hebrew slaves under control. And so we're going to drown a bunch of their babies. And then after the Egyptians kill all of the Hebrew male babies, of course, the final plague is the death of all of the Egyptian firstborns. It boomerangs. It comes back around the story of Esther with Heyman who creates some gallows and he's going to do some kind of mass execution and elimination of the Jewish people. Well, he ends up swinging on his own gallows famously. That same principle of using violence and horrific behavior to try to get the things you want in a world kingdom sense. And then that coming back around on you is what Jesus is talking about here in Matthew chapter 26 when he gets arrested and Peter goes swinging around with a sword and cuts off the ear of the servant of the high priest. And then Jesus responds to that situation saying the following, put your sword back in its place. Jesus said to him, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I can't call on my father and he'll at once put at my disposal more than 12 legions of angels? But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way? And it's possible there that that last little line, the scriptures be fulfilled to say it must happen in this way is a nod to what Luke records Jesus saying overtly from Isaiah 53 that we looked at yesterday or the day before about the Messiah being numbered amongst the transgressors. But back to the original point, this is where we get another one of those super famous Bivalisms that everybody uses. And maybe we don't all remember exactly where they came from originally because we just hear them so much. But this is one of those live by the sword, die by the sword. And usually this is employed as a metaphor for doing something that's a little bit nefarious or sometimes even doing something just a little bit too repetitively that eventually comes back around on you. If it's nefarious, the idea is that you're introducing a behavior that can only result in that same behavior being reflected back at you. If it's, you know, overdoing things, it's like, ah, well, your football team's got a great running game. So we're just going to run the ball all the time, all the time, all the time. But eventually you're running backs, get worn down and injured. And now you can't do that thing anymore and you don't know how to do anything else other than that. So you lived by the sword and you died by the sword. I think it's fair to say that those are the two slightly different variants that you hear floating around for how this particular saying of Jesus is used. But what does Jesus mean by it? Well, I think it's pretty evident, right? He's clearly drawing on a whole bunch of biblical themes wherein people did nefarious, bad, awful things, maybe even in the service of good. And it came back around on them. Tolkien is playing on this theme as we see the interaction with the ring of power the way that certain members of the fellowship look at the ring and they're like, this is a weapon of the enemy to employ it is to affirm the behavior of the enemy. And in the same way, the enemy could not resist the corrupting allure of the power of this great ring. So we would not be able to resist it either. Whereas others like Sean Baines, Bormere, if you've seen the movies, is like, no, why shouldn't we use it as a weapon against our enemy? And so he's very optimistic that he could live by the sword, but not die by it. Whereas other older, wiser members of the fellowship of the ring and the council of the ring look at it and say, this is a sword metaphorically that if you wield it, you will die by it. You cannot keep from having this boomerang background on you. So in its immediate context, I think this is pretty simple, right? Jesus is going to the cross on purpose. That's been the plan all along. Jesus asked just a minute ago in Matthew 26 if there might be any other way if this cup could pass from me. And we learn from Luke that other than an angel showing up to be like, Hey, I'm going to take care of your needs and anticipation of this, that there, there is no affirmative answer from the father. The father does not show up to bail Jesus out or to prevent him from having to face this thing. So the answer is, no, the plan that we put together, we're going with it. Jesus never gives any indication that he's anything other than fully committed to the plan, though understandably it's one that's a lot for him to take in. Jesus does not resist arrest. He goes as we read in Isaiah 53, like he is like a sheep to before the shearers, like a lamb to the slaughter's walking right into it knows exactly what the deal is because as we read in Isaiah 53, the whole point is for the transgressions of everybody else to rest on his shoulders for him to take on the responsibility for that. In other words, what Jesus is walking into here is a situation where everybody else, all of humanity has metaphorically or literally lived by the sword, but Jesus is going to go and die by the sword on the behalf of humanity. He's going to go and take the punishment that boomerang effect is going to go back on him. But that means that the solution, the initiation of the kingdom, it's not going to come the same way that you initiate all the other kingdoms of the world. I mean, if you want to start a new thing, you throw a big riot and you hope people will rally to your side and then you go and you break into the Bastille and grab the weapons or whatever you do and you make some sort of big symbolic gesture and then you go to war and you kill the people who you needed to defeat and you bring them to their knees and maybe through the power of popular uprising and a little bit of intervention from outside sources to assist with the rebellion. You have a rebellion and you make a new government and you know, hey, when in the course of human events, right? Like maybe from time to time, that kind of thing is needed to happen throughout history. Maybe at other times it's the wrong thing. It's just there's too much stuff to even look at. It's too broad a brush to even speak in generalizations about. I don't know how often you should probably have rebellions. What I do know is that is how power changes hands. That's how you get a new government. That's how you overthrow corrupt rulers. Maybe that's even how you overthrow good rulers and other circumstances. But what we're getting here is a description of a kingdom that's initiated without any violence at all. That doesn't have to happen. You don't have to have a violent global conquest after first defeating your immediate rivals within just a few years of the advent of your religion. And then you go and violently subjugate half of the world to make your thing go. Nope. You don't have to win an arms race or win an economics race to defeat everyone and make the thing go. No. In fact, Jesus kingdom here, the beginning of Christianity, it's going to catch on. Because early Christians follow the example of Jesus, which is a great book by Rodney Stark. I think it's called like the rise of early Christianity or something. He's a well, I don't know where he is now. He's maybe Washington and Baylor. Those are the places I associate this guy with. But he's a historical sociologist who writes in a very accessible way for normal people. And he makes the argument in this work that I think is compelling and fully rooted in evidence that Christianity did catch on by people acting like Christ. Christianity didn't win because the Christians got swords and killed people or had rebellions. That wouldn't have worked. There was a lot more motivation and money and people behind the barcocca revolt in the first third of the second century, about a hundred years, well, real, like almost right at a hundred years after the death and resurrection of Christ. There was a revolt, like a second Jewish rebellion, not the one in 70 AD, a later one. And Rome annihilated the rebels. They won big and they won violent. Christianity would not have won in this way. There was no path to victory through violence. So even from a pragmatic point of view, even we only reduce it to that Jesus command here. They don't do that. All who draw the sword are going to die by it. It checks out that that wasn't going to work on a pragmatic level, but how much more so on duplicating the values of the kingdom level. Jesus defeated death by losing, or at least in world categories, it looks like losing. He lost his trial. He lost some sort of game of cunning to avoid being arrested or to get caught. He lost to death and was straight up killed. He lost in the court of public opinion in the short run. I mean, everybody's throwing dirt in the air and yelling crucify him here in just a couple of pages. I mean, by all world metrics, especially in the short term, he lost bad. And through that came victory. The seed it fell to the ground and it died and it grows up into something enormous. Little mustard seed grows up into something gigantic. This little bit of yeast, it affects all of the dough in the positive biblical sense of that expression. And so at the first and most basic level of understanding what's going on with this violent confrontation in the garden in Jesus immediate response to say, stay your sword, because all who draw the sword will die by the sword. At the most basic level, it would seem that he is looking backwards and saying like, just look at the history of all of the stories that I am the fulfillment of. This never works out. It always boomerangs. And then looking in the immediate moment, he's pointing to the values of the kingdom that he's lived out and articulated so completely. The values of this kingdom are different than the values of this world, how you conceive of your enemy and what you do in response to your enemy on an individual level is different than the values of the world. And then I think he's looking forward with this remark and anticipating how the church was going to flourish and grow and have the gigantic global effect that it would. It wasn't going to be through the sword. Now, look, eventually the persecuted church became the persecuting church somewhere into the Middle Ages. There are a couple of Roman emperors who flirted with this. This should just be another conversation. You know what? Yeah, it's going to be another conversation. I was going to do this in one, but I got a bunch more than I want to process through on this. So we're going to keep talking about violence and Christianity and live by the sword, die by the sword and Jesus kingdom values next time around. I'm just going to abruptly hit pause right there because I can. I like you. This is fun. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
