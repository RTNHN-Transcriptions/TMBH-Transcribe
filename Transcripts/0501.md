 I just watched a show on Netflix called Midnight Mass is by something Flanagan. John Flanagan, David Flanagan. Mr. Flanagan made a show called Midnight Mass. It's a really effective program. I don't like horror stuff, generally speaking, but man, this overlapped so much with Christianity and with what happens when Christianity goes sideways, it had more Bible in it than just about any show I've ever seen ever. And it was an interesting mix. A pretty significant percentage of that Bible was like, yeah, well, yeah, that's kind of what it means. That's right in context. Okay. Wow. That's deep dive Bible too. That's not like the obvious stuff that most shows would remember from 30 years ago. I mean, like, I wasn't there a verse about this or something. There's a significant amount of Bible that causes you to say, wow, whoever did this, they have thought about this document deeply. But then a bunch of the other stuff that you get that are Bible quotes and Bible references throughout the show are an absolute butchering of the text. Like, what? No, no, that doesn't mean that. What are you doing? That's not what I know where that's from. That's not with a content that doesn't make any sense. But before you're even done catching up in your brain and trying to reason through why that lady's way off on what she's saying about the Bible, she's already quoting another crazy passage way out of context. And that's crazy too. And the whole thing is absolutely dizzying. So I really liked the show, even though, as always, I don't recommend that you watch anything ever. All shows are bad and should be avoided at all costs. I just look, I just understand the word diverse room and probably I'm among the least defendable. And so my threshold for what I'm going to watch is way different than yours and look just where you're going to get along. It's going to be fine. That's the 10th time I've made that disclaimer. You're smart. Do with it. Whatever you want. I'm not recommending that you watch the show. I really appreciated it though. Because of that Bible theme and because of a second theme that it explored deeply and that was the theme of resurrection. They hold up a dark mirror with a little bit of a warp to it toward some pseudo Christian ish notions of resurrection. And that's where it gets creepy and weird. And I think this show was number one for a few weeks on Netflix here of late, not because of all of the Bible stuff. Though that was very interesting, not because of the performances. Though my goodness, they were excellent. The dude who plays the priest in this show, that's the best performance I've seen in anything in ages, just phenomenal work. It's not because of that. I think it's the theme of resurrection. I think it's because it got into that most notable of topics. It flirted with the topic, what happens when we die. And whenever you ask the question, what happens when we die, you're really dealing with the question of do we matter? What is the point? What is going on here? And some people are going to like to deal with that in ways that look more like hallmark movies that deal with grieving. Some of us are going to be more open to dealing with it, processing it with shows that look a little bit more like midnight mass. Again, you do you, but I think that's why people turned out for this thing because we've always wondered, we've always wanted to know all of our religious context, bring us back to this question. It's kind of like the bottom line. You're like, yeah, but what happens to me? Where do I fit? Like, great. So you got all these truths and all this stuff. But like, I only get the one consciousness. I only get the one body. Do I get to play any role other than the few years I have left to be alive in all of this thing? Or is that it? Because if I get to play a role longer term, then I'd really like to think about that and figure out what I need to do to prepare for this. But if you're telling me that that's just kind of it, well, I guess why would I even bother with your dumb thing? I guess I'm not very interested. And we see that same friction as we've been talking about for the last few days developing in the time of Christ. You've got groups of people, not even like each other very much, but groups of people who all agree that, yeah, there's life after death. There is something eternal to this whole proposition. And however that exactly works, it comes from the power of God. Then you got other people who would say, no, there's no life after death. Like you live for a while and then you die. And life is somehow better lived if you acknowledge that there's a deity who doesn't resurrect you. And so we help people acknowledge that. And the group I'm referring to the latter there is the Sadducees. The Sadducees did not believe in something happening after you die. They did not believe in the resurrection of the dead. And they would even argue that that wasn't really the Old Testament position, the biblical position that the they would say the scriptures, I suppose, don't really teach any kind of resurrection. So yesterday we looked at that and I think we saw that, yeah, pretty clearly there is an eternal life resurrection notion that seems to run through the Old Testament. It was all over the place. It was in Psalms. It was in prophecy. We didn't look at these passages back in first and second Kings, but like literal actual physical resurrections happened there with Elijah and Elisha. So what's going on? So at least for me, I'm content to say, I just don't think the Sadducees are reading their text, right? I think they're incorrect and that the religious assumption, the biblical assumption of the whole thing was that, oh, yeah, yeah, you're much bigger than this body. You last much longer than this body by the power of God. So acknowledging that, what do we do with the New Testament then? How has this been coming up here? And has Jesus even actually talked about it that much? Well, yeah, I think it does kind of slide by because we just anticipate that, well, of course Jesus is for resurrection. They haven't been to Sunday school. I've heard Christian songs and stuff. Christians believe in resurrections, but they say it funerals. Like, of course, but yeah, where did he actually say that though? And then you go back and look through it and you're like, oh, yeah, there, there, there, sure. Matthew chapter seven for starters back to the Sermon on the Mount. The cautionary tale after all of his teaching is the one that talks about this last day where everything gets judged and sorted out and not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven. Oh, well, yeah, that reminds me that pretty much all the language, even prior to Matthew seven about entering the kingdom of heaven, it sure sounds like that's referencing something longer lasting than like a religious conversion where you're a part of a political party or a tribe until you die. I mean, you're talking about an inheritance. So that little acknowledgement of Matthew seven then bumps me right back to the beatitudes in Matthew five, like a blessed are the porn spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. That sounds like they're going to stay poor in the spirit for a while, but like that blessing comes later. Blessed are mourned, they're going to be comforted. And then the last beatitude, a blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Persecuting often means you get killed. And so then how can you get the kingdom of heaven? If you're just dust after that, no, all of this language in the sermon on the mount points to the idea that there is something that happens afterwards. This notion of a reckoning reappears in Matthew chapter eight, when the centurion meets Jesus on the road to Capernaum. And Jesus was like, whoa, dang, that's a really good answer. Centurion about authority and about Jesus power and ability to heal the centurion's servant even from a distance. And then you remember Jesus says, I tell you the truth, I haven't found anyone in Israel with such great faith. He's talking about the centurion who's a Gentile Roman. I say to you that many are going to come from the east and the west and I'll take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Does that sound like an actual dinner like a cracker barrel to you? Because I don't think it sounds like that. I don't think it sounds like a thing that you send out imitations to and it just happens once. It's like he's talking about something celestial cosmic, something bigger than all of that. All of the language of Jesus that talks about some sort of reckoning seems to me to clearly indicate that there's an expectation of eternal life here. So it's not even subtle. I mean, we know Jesus believes in resurrection and eternal life. Because over in John, he says, I'm the resurrection and the life and he resurrects somebody right after that. He keeps saying that the son of man is going to be put to death by these religious leaders and then he's going to be raised back to life on the third day. So I'm shooting fish in a barrel here. I understand that. I just want to do our diligence. So instead of me being like, no, trust me, Jesus is definitely for resurrection. He said that a whole bunch. Just trust me. I want to like actually show you and remind each other of what we've looked at together. Matthew 1028 telling the disciples what it's going to be like to go out on their big open world quest. It's dangerous to go alone and take this. Don't be afraid of those who can kill the body, but cannot kill the soul. Rather be afraid of the one who can destroy both the soul and the body in hell. Yes, I understand that is a scary sounding passage, but we already broke that down and it's scariest back when we talked about that passage as we were getting there. Verse 39 of Matthew 10, whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Well, come on. Both of those twin verses that are right next door to each other in Matthew chapter 10 point the idea that you're going to do some things in this life and it might end up getting you killed in my name, but there's this much grander, greater thing on the other side of all of that. Then I think about Matthew chapter 17. And if there was any question about whether or not the earliest parts of the Old Testament that are the Sadducees favorite parts of the Old Testament included the idea of resurrection, well, this incident in and of itself is like perfectly crafted to push back on the Sadduce and assertion that, yeah, well, maybe you could find some references like you guys talked about yesterday in the podcast later in the Old Testament, but in nearly going, no, no, no, that's not what the assumption was. Well, Matthew 17, you literally got like Moses and Elijah showing up and they are indeed resurrected and interacting and hanging out with Jesus and the disciples. That anecdote demonstrates Jesus understanding of resurrection and pushes back on the Sadducean understanding of resurrection as well. Matthew 19, the question that the rich young ruler asks when he walks up to Jesus. You remember what it was? He said, I totally remember. I'm just quickly skimming for it to make sure I get it right. There is teacher. What good thing must I do to get eternal life? That's Matthew 19, 16. And Jesus does not shoot down the part of the question that's about eternal life. He shoots down the part of the question about good. And there's probably more places where he does. Yeah. Just a second. 18. The business, I can't find it, the business about your hand, your foot causing you to sin. Verse eight, here it is. If your hand or your foot cause you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It's better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. My point is this. I'm sure there are a ton more examples that you're thinking of in screaming right now as you are in your sweat drenched unitard at the workout club listening to this. All I want to do accomplish today is to remind ourselves of some of this and just be like, no, no, okay, we're not going to get rattled by the sad. Just, you know, definitely the assumption of everything we've seen in Matthew so far from Jesus is that there is eternal life that people go on after death and there is a bigger thing that is going to unfold by the power of God. And I think I hope it is time really well spent to make sure that we know and have in our brains in our hip pockets for us to be able to say this is exactly where the sadges these are coming from. And this is where everybody else and most notably Jesus is coming from. If we get that then the little parable slash question there about to hit Jesus with is going to make a lot more sense. And this whole anecdote is going to pop that much harder. Thanks everybody supports this thing at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. That is super cool of you.
