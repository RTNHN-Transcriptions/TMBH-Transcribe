 Now, while back my wife and I watched through the HBO mini series called share no goal, which is, you know, you can figure out what it's about. It's the nuclear power meltdown that happened in the 80s. And I was really well done. I had, uh, Stellen Scarsgard. I never know how to say his last name, something like that. The, uh, Richard Harris's kid, Jared Harris. I think it is Jared Harris. He was in Mad Men and the expanse and stuff like that as very well acted, very well put together. And you can tell a good show when it has motifs, when it has themes that are happening visually and in terms of the story beats that cause you to think about something deeper, like the insidiousness of evil and the contagiousness of evil and rot. And that theme is carried out in share noble masterfully by the way, this invisible radiation gets on all kinds of seemingly innocent things like clothes or babies rattle or even you. It's on a person. And then anything that, that baby rattle or that item or that person gets around is then infected with the rot with the radiation with the disease with the death. And it's, it's a very powerful profound theme that is dark, but it's good. It's excellent. You got to watch from time to time to balance out all of the superhero movies and the other fluffier stuff. And likewise, the Bible has a very similar theme on both a spiritual theological level and also occasionally manifesting on a physical level. There's this idea that rot, that death, that sin is very contagious. It gets on one thing. It goes to the next. It gets on one person at the beginning of human history and it gets handed off to all of the rest of people throughout human history. And it's undefeatable. You can't wash radiation out of your cells once you walked into the blown out reactor at share noble. And you also can't wash the death and stain of the human problem of brokenness of entropy out of the cells of the human. And this comes up all over the Bible thematically and overtly. But whereas in share noble, there's not a lot of hope for making this death. This contagious rot go away other than entombing things in concrete and never going back to that place ever, ever again. In the Bible, there's a little bit more of a remedy that is hold out to the contagious rot and death. And that is this equally contagious, redemptive work of God, work of Jesus, the contagious nature of the values of the kingdom. It's a little seed that grows into something bigger. All of the kingdom parables of Matthew 13 talk about the replicatability and contagiousness of the redemption of God in one type of imagery or another. And further, we get just a couple of examples of this leaking over into the physical. And I don't know what to do with these. I'm pretty clear on what's happening with the theological idea of the human problem and its contagiousness and the work of God to defeat that human problem and its contagiousness correspondingly. But when it comes up and manifests physically, it's a little bit odd. So you've got this example in the Old Testament. It's in the middle of second Kings. I don't remember exactly where Elijah's bones bring somebody back to life. And I don't even remember all the details off the top of my head. I should have looked that up and been more careful with it. But I don't know what you do with it, but it's recorded like it happened there. And then you get a couple of moments later in the New Testament, and I'm a little bit fresher on Acts. So I remember Acts chapter five, you get this passing account of Peter's shadow passing over some people and they have whatever affliction or ailment they have dealt with. And then you get another account of Paul having like some handkerchiefs or something that he had touched. And somehow that brings about healing. You get a few allusions to this after the Bible in church history, but I don't know. It doesn't feel like this is caught on as like a phenomenon. I mean, if it worked, I'm sure this would have caught on and people would have latched onto this idea that there's an efficacious physical, reliable, repeatable, transmissible healingness that can go on an item. And I know that there are surely some of you sitting here talking with me, who were like, yeah, our church has that and it works. I mean, cool. I haven't seen that. I am going to go ahead and be skeptical of such claims. But I don't know. You've seen different stuff than I do. We can agree to disagree on that. But no matter how skeptical I might be of such claims about items from time to time holding the power of God in modern times, I can't deny that we get at least those three examples off the top of my head in the Bible of that occurring. So why do these occurrences happen? Well, I think the reason is pretty simple, contextually, at least in Acts, it's to demonstrate in keeping with the commissioning of the missional discourse in chapter 10, where Jesus sends out his disciples on a big open world quest and he tells them like there's going to be miraculous stuff that you're going to be a part of and it's indicative of Jesus' authority. It's a way of saying the authority of the king is on my messengers and in both accounts in Acts in Acts chapter 5 and then again in Acts chapter 19, the validity of Peter and Paul are in question. They're powerful groups that are like, I don't think you're actually a representative of the true God. And so I think narratively the best case for why these two little accounts are thrown in there is to demonstrate that people figured out that Peter and Paul did have authority that was on loan from Jesus because they were claiming Jesus and there was so much miraculous stuff that even their shadow or their used hanker chief had miraculous stuff. And it's almost like an ancient Near Eastern way of expressing something like, you know, that guy, he's worked on this way longer than I have. He's got more knowledge about that subject and his pinky finger than I've got in my whole body. You know that expression. Maybe it's illustrating the same thing and it isn't entirely unprecedented from the life of Jesus either because we do have these handful of accounts where somebody just touches Jesus outfit and they get better. And that's what we run into in Matthew chapter 14 as we get to the end of that chapter. Why would I not have had my Bible open to that part when I knew that's the part we're going to talk about? The disciples have finally just said, all right, you're the son of God. Okay, we get it. We're tracking with who you are. There's no other way to explain it. And they're still coming off of this epiphany. They crossed the Sea of Galilee and they land over there. And then verse 35 of Matthew 14 says, and when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. Brought other sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak and all who touched him were healed. Okay, a couple of these things going on narratively here. One, it reemphasizes the reality that Jesus just isn't sick of people, that even though this is a normal Tuesday for him, he's going to keep on doing it. He looks at the crowds and he has compassion for them. He's always on mission, even though he needs a break. And two, he probably needs a break. Maybe not in the way you or I would need a break, but the text is trying to funnel us in our narrative thinking to a place where we realize, like, this is going to happen everywhere he goes. I mean, did you hear what I just read? They didn't even know him over there. But somehow they figured out what he looked like. They were like, that's a guy. That's a guy. Go get Aunt Gina with the gout. Let's have him spiritually lance that and get rid of all the uric acid. Just bring everybody in, get all the ulcers fixed and the weird disfigurations. See if he can do anything about male pattern baldness. This is going to be awesome. There's no record of him teaching or doing anything. It's like the crush of the crowd is so great that all he was able to do was heal. And even some people are maybe just taking cues from what we saw back in Matthew chapter 9 where the lady with the bleeding problem that made her unclean said to herself, Matthew 921, if I can only touch his cloak, I'll be healed. And she touches the hem of his garment and she is healed. That rumor clearly made its way to Genesis. And everybody's like, that'll work. It worked the one time. Let's keep doing it. And so is this really that productive? Well, I mean, kind of sure productive for those people. It's making their lives better. Is it productive in the grand spiritual narrative? Well, I mean, I guess it's pointing out that this is God in the flesh and that he has power to spare that you can get more healing power out of the members only tag sticking off the front of his jacket that you can get from the best physicians in the entire world. So that's all really compelling. But we see the crush of the crowds is getting this to a point where he's not really teaching. He's not really moving things forward in that regard. And as we're going to see in the next chapter, anytime he does open his mouth, he's immediately met with resistance from the religious leadership who have already committed in their minds and are already plotting for how they can get him executed. So narratively, this is going to move us into what happens in the second half of the book of Matthew. It's going to cause us to say like, if this guy wants a break or he wants to continue to even exist, he's going to have to leave town for a while. And indeed, that is what we're going to see happen. But back to the bigger theme that this passage has us talking about today, that theme that the disease of self runs through my soul, that it's contagious, that it's radioactive, that this rot can't help but spread and that counteractingly God's redemption can't help but spread. And this is also contagious in a manner of speaking. Getting back to that theme, we see that bridge over into the physical and people are touching the hem of Jesus garment. And so later after Jesus has been executed and resurrected and descended and now the baton is in the hand of Peter as was predicted in Matthew chapter 10 in the missional discourse. And later the baton is in the hand of Paul, it would make sense that this would be a familiar miracle that the Holy Spirit could imbue these two guys with in moments here and there that would cause people to be like, Oh, I remember that from people touching the hem of Jesus garment. And we know that that miracle spread by reputation because Jesus hadn't been to Genesis or at in Matthew chapter 14. And people there were like, we heard about the garment thing, we should do that. So by having Paul and Peter do that, it answers one of the questions people would have as they read through say, Luke and its sequel acts and are like, well, is this really a continuation of what Jesus was doing? Well, the answer is these two guys are apparently leaking power much like Jesus was as well. I think I could have picked better language for that. That sounded creepy and weird. You get the point. So even here in what looks like a narrative afterthought, I mean, it would be easy to forget even exists between the events of Matthew 14 and Matthew 15. You're still seeing really important clues for how the whole story unfolds, what questions the original audience would have been asking, what kind of stuff would have stood out to the original audience and we're seeing profound theology. I love the band Cake, one of my favorite bands of all time. And they have got some sneaky potent lyrics, particularly on the theme of human depravity. And they've got one song from their album, Pro Longing the Magic. And this song, Ham of your Garment, not one of their more famous songs. And it goes like this, except when they do it, it's good. I am intrinsically no good. I have a heart that's made of wood. I am only biting time, only reciting memorized lines. Let me keep going. And I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment. No, I'm like a bunch of, oh, yeah. Oh, right. And like, you know, whip sounds and stuff like that. If you haven't heard it, it works. It's better than what I just did. But the song is incredibly insightful. The lyrics are obviously drawing on exactly this passage and they get the theological take home here that whether these people understood what they were acting out or not, the truth of the matter is Jesus is being held out here as other, as different, as entirely better. And the reality that people are fawning at him, trying to just touch a part of his clothing, is even the hem, the corner stitch of his garment, holds more power, more promise, more ability to deal with that infectious radioactive rot of the human problem than even the most sophisticated or sage of other people that that fawning, desperate crowd could go and track down. So high five to you, John McCray for writing incredibly insightful, theologically astute song that takes what might be treated as a throwaway little passage in the narrative, but instead points out the standing of Jesus and the standing of humanity as we as humans are held out in the Bible as being utterly incapable of resolving the rot, the radiation, the crisis of sin, human failure and imperfection with Jesus being held out as the only solution to that problem for which we desperately need a solution. Good stuff. I've gone on and on again, but I've had fun. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. Hey guys, it's Jeff and I thought Matt's vocal take earlier in this episode needed some musical accompaniment. So here you go. I am intrinsic to no good. I have a heart that's made up wood. I am only biting time. I am only reciting the rise minds. And I'm not fit to cut the hem of your garment. No islands like a, oh yeah, all right. Whips sounds and stuff like that. If you haven't heard it, it works. It's better than what I just did.
