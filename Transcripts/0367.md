 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. We're doing something really fun right now. Yesterday, we started a conversation with Denver Seminary Professor Dr. Craig Blomberg. He's a part of the new international version translation committee and is phenomenal at this kind of stuff. He's one of the people who I really look up to in this world. And so I am privileged that he was up for extending our conversation and hanging around for an extra segment here. So I'm going to have Jeff play some music and we're going to jump back in with Dr. Craig Blomberg and keep talking about the manuscript evidence and the little bit of controversy behind these couple of verses in Matthew chapter 16 we've been looking at. Hey. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. What was the final bit of evidence that tilted you toward this should be included with the footnote? We haven't said anything about the internal evidence, the actual contents of the disputed verses. And it's absolutely fascinating because you can find in ancient Jewish and Greek sources earlier than the New Testament as well as modern European folklore, rhymes like red skies at morning, sailors take warning, red skies at night, sailors delight. And if all you're thinking of as we love to do in Colorado is some of our gorgeous sunrises and sunsets, this sounds completely backwards because if I see a red sky at night, I'm looking to the west, I'm looking to a place where there are at least enough clouds to scatter the sunlight as the sun is setting. And that's what makes the sky such beautiful red and orange. Well, if clouds are coming from the west and I'm, of course, if you're in Colorado, you can't be out on a body of water at night because we don't have anything big enough. That would say, oh, maybe there's a chance of rain. That's not something I take the lighting. And the same thing is in the morning, if I'm looking to the east and there are clouds to create a nice bright sunrise, then those clouds moving from west to eastern kind of scatter. So at first glance, I read this and I say, this is entirely backwards. Well, this is not the phenomenon that's being talked about. You can actually Google stuff, including red sky and see pictures from the viewpoint of people on large bodies of water when a large chunk of a sky has this reddish glow to it. And it has everything to do with whether there is a low pressure cloudy buildup that actually cleans out the atmosphere or a high pressure meteorologist call a dirty sky that therefore scatters the light. And so this was true in the ancient world. There were places and people, of course, couldn't have put it in scientific language, but there were places where this phenomenon was observed and it made sense. And the other places where it didn't, I discovered that where this works is largely between the 30th and 60th latitude north and Israel is at the 31st latitude, but Egypt is at the 26th. The two major early manuscripts don't have this, both came out of Alexandria and Egypt. It would have been completely natural for them to omit it because they would have said, this isn't true. This is backwards here. It makes Jesus look dumb and wrong and undermines his point. Exactly. How about that? That raises a question of inspiration then. So is that okay? What do you make of that as a theologian and as a Bible guy, if the cops in Egypt, if the Christians who were born out of the same tradition, as Apollos of Alexandria, look at that text a little bit later on and they're like, this one is really a sticking point for our people because it makes the Pharisees and Sadducees look right and Jesus looked dumb and out of touch. Are they messing with the Bible there? Are they under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit when they pull that out of the text as the Bible is still taking shape? What do you do with it? Yes, to the first question and no to the second. They are messing with the Bible, but no, the historic Christian doctrine and the Jewish doctrine of the inspiration of what we call the Old Testament before that was always, has always been based on an understanding of what the original texts most likely read. As you mentioned earlier, there are places where people added, not often, there are really two main places. You mentioned the long-grandy of Mark, there's also the story of the woman caught in adultery in John. Those are the only two places in the entire Bible for that matter and certainly in the entire New Testament where as many as 12 verses appear to have been added at a later date. Other than that, this is right here in Matthew 16, one of the next longest possible additions anywhere. So this is a stunningly small amount of controversy on stuff like this, given how old these documents are and what we're dealing with. That's right. Yeah, inspiration means once I have done my best to come up with what seems to have been the original text, Christians have said that's what we believe God inspired. God did not providentially preserve the text by supernaturally censoring or destroying every copy that had a slight difference in it, which is basically what the Muslims did with the variant additions that Quran after Muhammad died. They destroyed all the variants and now teach their people that they're never worrying. Christianity has always led everything out there for the world to see, but when you do see how little of the text is affected by anything of this size and then you still have similar teaching. It's not exactly the identical metaphor, but it's about understanding the weather from the skies in Luke 12, 54 to 56. So at some point Jesus taught something very much like this and then we say, well, what is the point in Matthew 16, one to four does the point require versus two to three? No, it just enhances it. The Pharisees and Sadducees are not genuinely seeking after truth, they, Matthew says, came and tested. They were trying to trap Jesus and Jesus consistently refuses to do something miraculous just to prove himself for the sake of skeptics because as we see after this comes after the feeding of the 4,000, it's like, seriously, after a miracle like that, you still wanna sign. What more would convince you? And my guess is that had he immediately worked some miracle on the spot, somebody else would have said, oh, do another one. Oh, well, or do this or so forth. When you're not genuinely seeking after truth, then nothing's gonna be effective. That's the main point of the passage. Yeah, when we were looking at this last week, we jumped over to Luke 16 and just looked at this structure that Jesus seems to use from time to time, which is the, if this makes sense or seems common sensically right to you, how much more so should you be able to this? And he does so with the parable of the shrewd manager over there. It seems like we're getting the same little twist, the little turn of a phrase, the same little formula over here. And I think the passage, I'm with you. I think the passage is not as effective without it. I think the passage feels like a repetition of chapter 12 when he got asked the same question and gave roughly the same answer, but went into more detail on what the sign of Jonah would actually be. Here, it feels like another conversation is happening with this detail in place, whereas I suppose the critic would have an easier time saying, well, Matthew has his timeline confused or there'd be no reason for these leaders to ask this question a second time. Somebody misremembered. Well, it's a pretty specific detail. If the first time he got asked, he didn't say these things. And here he does. But he recently clicked in. The really interesting line there is at the end of the parable of the rich man in Lazarus, where Jesus says, in the parable Abraham speaking on behalf of God, he tells the man who's asked for Lazarus to come and give him some cool water. And that didn't work. And then he says, well, at least go and tell my brothers who are still alive that they've got a chance to repent and they don't have to come. Come to Hades and reply is, they have Moses and the prophets. Let them read them just because somebody would return from the dead while necessarily convinced them. And my goodness, we see that being fulfilled every day of every year in church history ever since. People who don't want to believe won't be convinced by the resurrection. They'll always find a way to explain it away. However, silly it is. This thing holds together pretty well. And yeah, we spent the majority of our time on the internal evidence. I think that might come as a surprise to someone guessing what the conversation like this would go like because it feels like it would just be science. You go and you add up the total number of manuscripts that have it, the total number of manuscripts that don't, then you multiply that by the earlyness quotient of each of those and there you go. That's what is Bible and that's what is not. And what you are explaining is a decidedly more complex, more critical process than just that simple math equation. Is that a fair statement? Right. And there are places where there is some small addition or omission and it is almost that formulaic. You look and all this manuscripts that we know of have something or don't have something. And it's not until centuries later that a variant of some kind appears. And then you ask the question of internal evidence, what's more likely it describes who would add it or leave it out and there's something about the context that says, oh yeah, it's clear. This only works one way. And so the internal and the external evidence line up and we say, how, Leah, I wish you did this all the time. This was an easy decision. But it doesn't do it all the time. Well, thank you for lending your expertise to this and helping us understand a little bit better how all of this business works. Is there anything that you're working on or resources that I can point people toward that you have out there? Well, I am privileged at this stage of my career to be doing some revisions of books that have done well enough that people still want them around according to Amazon, which is not quite as an errant as scripture. And July one is to be the release date of second edition of my book from Pentecost to Patmos. This time I have a co-author, a former student to Darlene Seal. And then I am working currently on what will be a third edition of Judith's and the Gospels and Introduction Survey. So that is keeping me well occupied. I'm going to link Craig's work on Amazon down below. It's worth your time. If you are here and you enjoyed this kind of a conversation and this kind of a podcast, Dr. Blomberg is, he's a rock star at this stuff. There's a reason that I called him and asked for this favor. And it really is a generous favor. So if you enjoy a conversation like this, you will enjoy what he's written down. And so many of the questions are going to naturally come up as you take a deep dive, look at the New Testament. There's a pretty decent chance that he has taken a run at that as well and you'll appreciate what he's been up to. So thank you so, so much for hanging out with me. And what we'd never met before, this is our first time bumming around. You just jumped in and absolutely killed it. So thank you, thank you, thank you. You're very welcome. Hey everybody, thanks for hanging out with us. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
