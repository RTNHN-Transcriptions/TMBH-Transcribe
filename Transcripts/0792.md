 Hey, it's me, Matt Whitman again. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. And for the second straight day, I interrupted a conversation we were having because I thought it was just going all too long. But I still got more than I want to cover from what we were talking about last time around. So we're just going to pick it up right where we left off after Jeff plays some music. ["The End of Chapter 22"] Jesus final debate with the Pharisees at the end of chapter 22 as Jesus going back to them and asking them or trying to put in front of them a correct understanding of Psalm 110. Let's go back and look at this passage. The Lord said to my Lord, sit in my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. If David then calls him Lord, Jesus is saying, how can he be his son? It's a very intricate argument that we went over carefully as we were going through it. But the thrust of it is something that once again points to the authority of God and the authority of Jesus. When that final rejection of Jesus authority happens at the end of 22, now we get all of chapter 23, which is just an absolute verbal beatdown of the religious leaders who consistently miss on assuming a right posture before the king and before this authority. And then in chapter 24, Jesus demonstrates his authority over the future, over the seemingly unchangeable, immutable, untouchable, unbreakable temple system and spirit of the age that is present in this odd relationship between Rome and occupied Jerusalem and the temple and everything that goes on with that. But when everything is done and you go through these dark days where the sun is darkened and the moon doesn't give light and the stars fall from the sky and the heavenly body shake, Matthew 2430, then Jesus says at that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. And he will send his angels and allowed trumpet call and they will gather as elect from the four winds from one end of the heavens to the other. What's being described is a full or nearly full revelation of the massively restrained power and authority that Jesus is claiming to have and that his actions and words seem to back up. Still, even with all of this, it's a really big claim to be like, that person right there is the most authoritative human to ever walk the earth and he doesn't even have a crown. When he finally gets one, it's fitted terribly wrong and made of awful material and it just makes his head bleed in an embarrassing way in front of everyone. It doesn't ride on a big war stallion when he finally does get to ride on something. It's a dumpy, silly looking little donkey. He doesn't get a regal insignia and when he finally does get one, it's put up there sloppily and in jest and mockery toward him. Yet, this is the truest realist thing. This is the truest, realist being. This is what authority looks like. It's just not authority fully revealed at this point for everybody to see. We've seen glimpses and it's been awe inspiring, disorienting even, but at this point, Matthew chapter 24, 25, 26, and we still don't know if he can beat death. And if he can't beat death, then it means there's something that's more powerful than you, even if you are more impressive than most people. In chapter 26, Jesus demonstrates his authority when he gets arrested, Peter goes swinging swords around. I mean, we'd know it's Peter from other accounts, but it's Peter, even though Matthew doesn't out him here. Then Jesus comes back saying, put your sword back in its place. For all who draw the sword will die by the sword, but you think I can't call on my father and I'll at once put at my disposal more than 12 legions of angels, but then how would the scripture be fulfilled? And so he's making it clear, I'm voluntarily submitting to what is happening next. Nobody's taking my life from me. I'm laying it down voluntarily. It's me combining a couple of different things that Jesus said. He gets arrested. He doesn't say anything for the longest time. And then finally, the high priest demands. Speak to the authority question. That's the one we wanna know about. Where you at on that? Are you the Christ, the Son of God? Tell us plainly, and Jesus finally answers. And he says in chapter 26 verse 64, yeah, it's as you say, Jesus replied, but I say to all of you, in the future, you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds of heaven. Authority, authority, highest authority, in fact. In other gospel accounts, we see Jesus saying even further, he's just talking to Pilate and the religious leaders and all of this stuff is going on that he explicitly emphasizes that the authority to do these things to him is on loan from God. And in doing so indicates that he's playing a much bigger, much longer game than what is going on here. He goes to the cross, he dies on the cross. And as soon as he does in chapter 27, well, some of those things that sound like the foretaste, the beginning, the first fruits of the rumblings, of the sign of the Son of man, they start to happen. There's an earthquake, the temple curtain is torn into even some dead people come back to life and even critical outsiders, even the people who killed him are like, I think that guy actually is the son of God. Dang, but still the religious leaders can't see it. They hatch a plot to make sure that Jesus will stay dead and that the power, the authority, if you will, of this story will be something that just dies with him and goes away after a couple of new cycles and that can be it. But with great power and great authority, death is defeated on the third day. Jesus gives a command, picks up right where he left off. I mean, there's no apologizing for I'm in charge. Go and do this, tell the brothers to go and do this. And without any thought of disobedience, the women who just fell at his feet and worshiped him as one who has maximum authority, they go, they tell the brothers that. And then we get into this final bit that we've been looking at here for the last week plus. They show up surely because they miss Jesus, they miss their friend, they miss the way things were, they show up because where else do they have to go? They don't know what to do next, but they show up because the king said so. And even with doubt still lingering or rattling around in their heads and their heart, they're not prepared to defy the king because this order is even more powerful and compelling than the one that Jesus gave all the way back in chapter four the very first time. He told them to get up and move and come and do a thing with him. And so when we get here and Jesus says, all authority on heaven and on earth has been given to me, what I'm trying to say over these last three conversations we've had that have taken us all the way back through the book of Matthew again, what I'm trying to say is he's earned it. He's not just yelling idiotic things at the internet. He's not just tweeting crap toward people. He's earned it. He beat death multiple times in other people and then death was defeated in him. He stood face to face with the most powerful authority figure the world has ever seen that being the Roman Empire and he didn't blink. He endured a kangaroo court with no real authority in the true eternal lasting spiritual sense and just let them do what they were gonna do for the bigger purposes of the plan that he and his father had agreed upon and that he was here to carry out and at least carry out in his part. Lots of people throughout history have said lots of religious things. Some of them have been very grandiose but this claim to authority is special. It's unique. It's backed up, not by the power of the state, not by bullets, not by swords, not by hope or fantasy or dreaming or imagining. It's backed up by who this guy is, what he's done, what he said, what God has done through him and the fact that he has not just demonstrated authority over human machinations, he's demonstrated miraculous supernatural authority over every institution of the physical world, over everyone of the rules and regulations that guide the natural world as we understand it and now he's gonna take all of that credibility and he's gonna push his chips to the middle of the table. Functionally what he's saying is, you guys remember everything? Cool. In light of that, here's what you need to do next. Powerful stuff. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
