 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now, we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Titus. When you turn the page from 2 Timothy over to Titus, if you're reading straight through the New Testament, it can be a little bit disorienting because it feels like in 2 Timothy, that is the end of Paul, like he's going to die shortly after that letter was written. And indeed, he did die shortly after that letter was written. And so you turn it over to Titus and it's like, what? How is Paul still writing letters? Well, this is an important moment for us to remind ourselves that the arrangement of the letters in the New Testament are not chronological. Now, that said, still Titus, this letter we're looking at today, is one of the latest letters that Paul wrote before his death. The Book of Acts takes us up to Paul being in prison and preaching freely in prison in Rome, but then the book cuts off pretty abruptly right there. In order to cobble together what happened in the rest of Paul's life, we have to go and look at the little personal details we get in a bunch of these letters that make up the rest of the New Testament. And when we do that, it becomes pretty evident that Paul did not die in that first very blase fair imprisonment that he experienced in Rome. Probably his accusers didn't even show up for the trial and they were like, well, I mean, you're free to go then. I guess that's that. It looks like after that, Paul went right back to Ephesus. It makes sense. He loved this church and he leaves his protege, Timothy, there. Then Paul goes up to mainland Greece probably and very quickly gets word from Timothy. They're like, whoa, we got problems. Like as soon as you left, it became very evident people might have been on their best behavior while you were here, but they are not on their best behavior now. What should I do? And then Paul writes first, Timothy, back to him, empowering him, encouraging him, commissioning him and being like, go get him, pal. You can straighten out that Ephesian church, I believe in you. From there, it looks like Paul journeys down to Crete, more on Crete in just a second, and leaves his buddy Titus, for whom this book that we're about to look at is named, on Crete, in the same way he left Timothy in Ephesus. Titus' job is going to be to straighten things out and make things go with the little churches that are popping up in Crete. From there, it looks like Paul goes back to mainland Greece where he gets word from Titus. Like, hey, I'm running into some problems here. The reputation of the Creteans as being not necessarily the most honest. It is a problem for the church. Please advise. And it looks like from mainland Greece, Paul writes back to Titus, the letter that we're getting right here, and gives him some instructions on what to do. Obviously, we're going to look more at that here in just a second. And then finally, Paul makes his way to Troas where he gets a surprise visit from the authorities and is arrested quickly without even time to gather his things. He doesn't get to take his coat with him. He doesn't get to grab all of his scrolls, and he's taken back to Rome and probably put in a much harsher second imprisonment. And this is the imprisonment from which he writes 2 Timothy. And this also then would be the imprisonment that leads to Paul's execution, his beheading at the hands of the Roman officials. So Titus then comes really close to the end of Paul's life, of Paul's ministry. And at this point, as we'll see when we look closer at the details of the book, these churches, they all have the same kind of problems. There's just four or five that seem to crop up at every church all around the world, wherever Paul is. And by now, he's a cagey veteran. He knows how to tackle these things and how to equip other people to deal with these things. Crete is a very significant historical location in the Mediterranean world. Let's just picture the Mediterranean Sea, right? This is big. It's long. It kind of looks like a wide biscuit. And up in the north, you got the Italian boot sticking down, Greek peninsula sticking down. That's Europe. And then on the south side of the Mediterranean Sea, you got North Africa. And then out on the west side of the sea, you get that little tiny baby pinch point that is the straits of Gibraltar between Portugal, Spain, up there in the north, and then like Morocco down there on the south and then clear out east. Of course, you've got Jerusalem and Judea and Asia and all of that business. Okay. If you just think about the boot that is Italy in the middle of all of that, and then you just go slightly east from that, there's a great big, long, flat, horizontal island. That one, if you can picture it, is Crete. And it's a really big deal because there's this whole civilization called Minoan civilization that is one of the early, great, dominant cities. And dominant expressions of Greek civilization from way, way, way, way, way back in history. We're talking centuries and centuries before Jesus and before Persia, way back there. They had a dominant military. They had robust mythology, the story of the labyrinth and the monster that guarded the labyrinth, the minotaurs, the Minoan civilization, Minotar. That comes from the island of Crete. And apparently back in the day, in a bid to assert Crete and dominance over all the other Greeks, they claimed that Zeus was born there and had a special place in his heart for Crete, a special affection for it. That Zeus was the patron god, not of mainland Greece, but of the Minoans. Now, as we know from what we learned about Corinth and Ephesus, there was big money back then if you could lay claim to a very important patron Greek god. And it created apparently this gigantic stir and hubbub about you, Creteans being big time liars. You know, dang, well, Zeus wasn't born on your island. That's ridiculous. And so dating all the way back to the sixth or even seventh century BC, you've got references from writings that came out of Crete about this reputation of the Creteans being liars, including one dude who was a seer, philosopher, prophet, poet, orator. His name was Epimenides. He was self critical of the Cretans for lying about Zeus. And Paul is actually going to draw on this ancient Greek thinkers words to agree with him and double down and say, you know what, lying is a problem there, but we're going to confront it with the truth of Christ. And that's the plan of attack that he hands off to Titus in this short little letter that he gives him. So what we discover in chapter one is that we're running into the exact same problem we have everywhere. There are Jewish sort of Christians who are here. They resent the Gentile Christians and they try to inflict the Old Testament law on these Gentile Christians, most notably in the form of circumcision, the sign of the covenant with Abraham, given all the way back in Genesis. But these guys double down on it and they're like, well, not only are we going to help you out by telling you you need to be circumcised and we actually have the toolkit right here just to make that happen whenever you're ready. But also, since this is such important information, we're obviously also going to have to charge you a certain clerical fee for delivering that important message to you. And Paul's letter to Titus just opens with him being like, no, we're not doing any of that. It's lying. It's stupid. Don't play along with it in any way. Point them to the truth of Christ. Ignore the lie. And then he, as I promised, cites Epimenedes here in verse 12 of Titus 1 and it is harsh. Paul says, even one of their own prophets has said, Cretans are always liars, evil, brutes, and lazy gluttons. This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth. I would like to distance myself from this claim a little bit right now. I've never been to Crete. I've flown over it a couple times. It looked really pretty in the pictures I've seen there. It seemed great. History is really interesting. But I understand what Paul is taking a swipe at here. And I understand how sick and tired of this same manipulation and the same falsehood he was at this point in the game. And I love the way he seems to be throwing down the gauntlet and saying, let's get rid of things that we know are lies. We know that happens there. And let's instead counter that with things that we know to be truth. And then Paul goes on to confront the second big problem here, which is that the Christian lifestyle isn't honoring to God as it's being carried out in Crete. And the way people conduct themselves in public life and in their households, it looks just like how the Cretans do things. And we just heard what both Epimenedes and Paul think about how the Cretans do things. So Paul's like, you gotta do stuff different. One, because it's honoring to God and obedient to your God. But second, because this is a testimony, it's a witness to the people around you. You guys gotta change. And so for what are we on now? The third, fourth time in his letters, Paul goes into the household. He's like, Hey, you gotta run your households differently. You can't do the flandering and you can't do the sloppiness with the relationships. You should look to build strong, healthy families that influence the community well, that serve the community well, and that point to the glory and the truth of Christ. The big overarching point though that Paul seems to be making in regards to all of this is that society is a mess and the grace of God is going to make society better. Now I'm seeing that in the world right now today. We live in a moment in time where everyone is constantly made to feel guilty about things they've done, that maybe they should feel guilty about things they've done, that maybe they shouldn't actually feel guilty about and things they didn't even do or have anything to do with at all. Guilt is a weapon to advance policy and social preferences at this moment in life. And it's a disappointing habit that we've developed as a society. I look forward to us getting that more in balance. But everybody as a result of that guilt society we live in is desperate for atonement, some mechanism for forgiveness. But no, no, no, we are not going to give it to each other. We are in a societal moment where we're going to hold that guilt over people as long as we can as a point of leverage. But the gift of Christ and of the church and of individual Christians to a society is grace. There is atonement. There is forgiveness. There is some mechanism to restore things that are tense, that are broken, that are calamitous. And that is the release valve that Paul seems to believe, and I happen to agree with him, that Crete in society was begging for. It was the problem they dealt with. And the Christians had a lock-and-key solution that was a perfect fit for what was wrong with Crete. And I would argue that part of the beauty of the book of Titus is that Paul spends chapter two and into chapter three, making a case that totally applies to the world we've built now as well with the power and effectiveness of grace in society delivered from Christ by Christians and the effect that that has, not just on people who believe in God or in the church, but on everybody. And I love the vision for things that Paul is painting a picture of here in this letter he's writing to Titus. When you visualize the book of Titus, picture the island of Crete when you think about the theme of the book, reflect on the grace of Christ, a societal grace even made evident by the lives of Christians and the church. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least catch chapter two, verse 11, through chapter three, verse eight. And with that, I would like to congratulate the both of us on unlocking the Titus achievement onto the teeny tiny little baby book of Philemon next time around.
