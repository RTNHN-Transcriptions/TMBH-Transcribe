 I'm going to be a double episode. Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and I'm already mentally committed to this being a double episode because this is one of the ones where we run around all over the Bible and we go and find the other stuff that relates to the thing that we're looking at right now. So buckle up and if you have a Bible, great. But as you've probably figured out somewhere along the line, if you're doing it, I've got one, I brought one with me. I have one right here. I'm going to read all the things to you and myself so that you can just, yeah, you can just listen to me read it and it'll be absolutely fine. I'm playing this video game with my kid right now. It's called Elden Ring. It's pretty fun. People seem to like it. But the thing I've really discovered is super, super hard. And they got these bosses that are just gigantic. They're like 20 times bigger than you. And all you can do is run up and whack them on the shin with your little sword or poking stick or whatever you got. And then they flip around and jump on your head and stomp you and they wield these weapons that are like the size of a camel, but the camel has spikes all over it and the spikes have poison on them. And you're like, I got to drink a potion, but you only get so many of those potions to feel better and see you try and run away for a second to drink your potion. But it takes an eternity to drink a potion and these jerks, they don't even leave you alone to drink a potion just to be sporting for a minute. They're just always on top of you. And it's super, super hard. But what I'm finding is one of the tricks for beating these big, nearly impossible bosses. I got to allocate the potions real carefully. If I just run in there and every time I get even dinged, I just chug a potion. It's never going to work. I have to have an efficient plan for how to ration out the potion use over the duration of this big boss battle, or I'm going to get it handed to me every single time. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 24, you got a situation where the good strategy is you got to ration out this oil. You got to think about how you're going to utilize this oil if you're a bridesmaid waiting around for an indeterminate amount of time for the bridegroom and the bride to get done with all their wedding stuff and to come out so you can have a classic ancient Near Eastern wedding procession and so that you can proudly light your bridesmaid lamp and walk with it and have oil to light the path the whole way and to keep the wedding crashers out. Because that's something that people really like to do back then was crash your wedding in the middle of the night and join the processional and get in for free to somebody's house when they weren't invited. And we've already seen another Bible passage that talks about what happens when you crash a wedding and you don't come in the right way. It's not a very popular thing. So you got a job as a bridesmaid. But in this parable that we're looking at in Matthew chapter 25, five of the bridesmaids are like, I'm going to allocate my potions properly to get through the whole boss battle and win metaphorically speaking. And the other five are like, I'm just guzzling potions left and right because I'm going to live forever and tomorrow may never come and they just don't plan carefully at all. And then they're running out of oil because they didn't plan right for the long haul. They weren't eyes up. They weren't situationally aware about what was going on and they're unable to fulfill their duties or participate the way they're supposed to participate as bridesmaids in this wedding. But as we discovered yesterday, right off the bat in Matthew chapter 25, we're reminded that, dang, Jesus and Matthew are super, super, super good at words because everything is building on top of something else. None of this is happening in a vacuum and even the subtle little things, just like the way a sentence is constructed to introduce this parable is a reference back to a whole bunch of other stuff. So at that time, the kingdom of heaven will be like, all right, at that time is the return of the son of man described in chapter 24, just a couple paragraphs earlier. The kingdom of heaven is like is clearly a reference back to the introduction to parables that we've seen all over the book of Matthew. And then we get what we're talking about with the visual, the image, the metaphor is 10 versions. It took their lamps. We were just talking about that. They go out to meet the bridegroom. We talked about that ancient Near Eastern wedding practice a couple of days ago, but that word bridegroom is something that I think we need to pause on for a minute here because that is also loaded language being intentionally employed for the benefit of Jesus disciples, for the benefit of Jesus original audience and for the benefit of anybody who is looking at the teachings of Jesus in light of all of the existing scriptures at the time. That being what we would call the Old Testament because this is not the first time that the Bible holds out God is using this bridegroom imagery to describe himself, particularly in his relationship with Israel in the Old Testament and surprise, surprise, we're going to go look at some of that stuff. So Isaiah 54, I'm excited to announce as I flip over there that I'm using my childhood Bible today that has notes that my dad wrote in the 80s and notes that I wrote as a kid in the early 90s. And I have notes on Isaiah 54. How about that? Oh, apparently young me was seeing an illusion to the Trinity here in Isaiah 54. And God, the father is spoken of as redeemer and Jesus is spoken of the same way. I don't know what that note means, but I wrote that down when George Herbert Walker Bush was president of the United States of America. So that is a fine childhood, the logical comment there from me. We are looking at verses four through six in particular, and that goes like this, do not be afraid. You will not suffer shame. Do not fear disgrace. You will not be humiliated. You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood. For your maker is your husband, the Lord Almighty is his name. The holy one of Israel is your redeemer. He is called the God of all the earth. All right, you catch the bridegroom, the husband language in there. For your maker is your husband, the Lord Almighty is his name. So remember Isaiah is writing a book that involves judgment and restoration and hope for the future and clarification on how God's promises to redeem are going to endure. And there's been this very special relationship throughout the Old Testament between God and his chosen people. Remember, he picked Abram out of the clear blue sky and was like, mmm, you, that guy right there. Yeah, from where the Chaldeans, I pick you of all the people in the world. And this is going to involve some circumcision. So that is going to be weird. But also it's going to be a really awesome thing because you weren't a people and now I'm going to make you into a people and you're going to have kids and you're going to have descendants that are going to be more than stars in the sky, little bits of sand on the beach. And I'm going to make this great nation out of you and you are going to be blessed as a nation, you and all your descendants. But also all of the nations are going to be blessed through you. And that is kind of the deal, the covenant that is unconditional that God makes early on in the Old Testament that sets the trajectory for like everything that comes after that. So from there on out, Abram who gets his name changed to Abraham, his descendants are in this very unique relationship with God that could rightly be described or characterized as a husband and wife and certainly not equal partners in this illustration. Don't think how we do marriage now. Think how they did marriage in the ancient Near East. The husband is the master of the house, the father of all the things, the patriarch that makes it go, the provider, the protector. And again, setting aside modern notions of what is best practice and normative for marriage and equity within a marriage. That is a very, very recent innovation. And here this imagery would play on the absolutely typical across the world expectations for what roles a husband and wife would play. And if anything, it's even exaggerating those expectations because of how great the distance is in this biblical imagery of God as husband or bridegroom to Israel, how great the distance is between him and his ability and capacities and how flailing and incompetent the bride is in this analogy, that being Israel who is portrayed as being unfaithful, unreliable, is wandering off, but this husband, this God is always portrayed. It's very reliable. If you poke around the Old Testament a little bit or you've hung out with me while we've looked around at the Old Testament, you know, the where I'm going to go next is to Hosea. I don't know that I even necessarily really need to read you like a verse from Hosea because the whole book of Hosea really makes this point as an analogy where Hosea is this bridegroom character to an unfaithful bride. Can you tell the pages on this old Bible are thicker when I turn them? It sounds different than when I use my normal Bible. Hosea to I don't know. I'm skimming, skimming. I know it's explicitly stated. There we go. Yeah. End of Hosea chapter two. In that day declares the Lord, you will call me my husband. You will no longer call me my master. I will remove the names of the balls from her lips or bales. No longer will their names be invoked. In that day, I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and birds of the air and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land so that all may lie down in safety. I will betrothed you to me forever. I will betrothed you in righteousness and justice and love and compassion. There's a lot going on there. I'm really glad I read all of that. I didn't remember what was in all of that text, but wow, that they kind of sums up the whole promise of the prophets in the Old Testament that Jesus is referencing back to and that Jesus is describing himself as the fulfillment of. I mean, all of the promises of God, they still count all of the failures of humanity are redeemed and the stuff that's broken and screwed up about us is purified. The chasing after false gods, lesser kingdoms, that is made right by God and it's all done so very tenderly and lest one fixate on that as God is some kind of cruel dictator, the imagery that he uses, both in the larger story of Hosea and specifically in verse 19 is the image of a tender loving husband who's patiently going through all the steps of betrothal in the process of earning this marriage at great expense to himself. As I was suggesting on the front end, we've got a lot of zipping around the Bible we need to do in this particular conversation to really understand this parable of the 10 virgins or 10 bridesmaids. So we worked on some Old Testament stuff. We got to work on some Matthew stuff and some bigger picture over arcing themes in the Bible over the next couple of days. So we'll just hit pause there and we'll pick it up where we left off tomorrow. Real quickly, I wanted to say, I noticed that there were a few new reviews that some of you dropped over on whatever various podcasting app you use. That is like the most helpful thing you can do. Every time I see even a small surge in reviews, I see a matching surge in new people signing up. I mean, if you review on any podcast app, even multiple podcast apps, I mean, it just keeps firing those bullets that is so dang helpful. You all who are doing that, you know what you're doing. You know what that means. And I see you and I am very, very grateful for your shrewd strategic part in making this conversation inclusive of more people. I appreciate that a lot. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. See you soon.
