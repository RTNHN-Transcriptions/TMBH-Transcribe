 Well, I back out a friend who is in the podcast, we have known just like forever sees since we were kids. And he heard one of the little intro things that we do where we get into like the likewise and then we get into Matthew with some silly story about my childhood or life or culture or whatever. And he heard this story. And the next time we talked, he was like, you had it placed here in your memory with these friends in this place, but wasn't it actually at this event at this time when we were even younger than that? And we sat around and we debated it. And the reason I'm being vague is because I don't remember exactly which story it was, but I do remember it sparking a really interesting conversation about memory and how we recall those events and how easy it can be to even rearrange them a little bit in our heads. And it was just a fascinating and fun conversation. And no point was my friend like, Hey, Matt, or should I say dirty, filthy, skanky liar. You told a story that I don't think is actually where the thing happened. No, he was like, Oh, yeah, well, that was just like this other time that we did this thing. But I seem to remember it happening in this one. And you seem to remember it happening in this one. And in the end, I think we landed on, I guess neither of us remembers specifically, but wow, is that in keeping with what our childhood was like, ha ha, the high five and then we hung out and talked about other things after that. Likewise, we run into a situation a lot like that in Matthew chapter 23 and verse 14. If you have a Bible, like a physical Bible with you, would you please take that and turn to it? And I would like to read Matthew chapter 23 verse 14 together out loud, even if you want to, I don't think it'll interrupt anyone or embarrass you, even if you're in a very crowded place or a quiet library to read every single word of this verse out loud with me. Ready? Here we go. Verse 14. Oh, there is new, you're not going to interrupt anybody when we read verse 14 together out loud is because there isn't one in pretty much every English translation of the book of Matthew, just skips a floor kind of like turn of the century skyscrapers did when they were really superstitious about the number 13. There was a 13th floor. They just label it 14. I mean, there is a 14th verse in Matthew 23. It's just labeled 15. What do you teach is the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites and then it goes on into the statement of next. Whoa. So we're missing a whole verse of the Bible. Now there's a gigantic controversy about this thing that rages on between particularly people who are most fond of a 17th century translation of the Bible called the King James Version. It's a good translation, especially for the resources, the manuscript evidence that the translation team had at the time that this was made. However, over time, some folks have developed an affinity toward the King James Version that has almost become its own theological tenant. I would say, I dial that back a little bit and say that was a really good translation for its era. I have confidence in modern Christian biblical scholarship and the large amount of manuscripts that we have at our disposal now to compare notes on versus the relatively very small amount of manuscript evidence that we had in the 17th century to compare notes on. That said, we still have a bit of a conundrum here. That is because the verses and chapters as we think of verses and chapters in English translations is something that got effectively locked into place in more like the 16th century. So it predates even the King James Version and even the early Christian reformers during the Protestant Reformation used this list of chapters and verses. It looks pretty much like what you have in your Bible in front of you right now, which means that all that numbering gets built in and then you get used to that numbering and you memorize verses. What happens then if as time goes along, you realize, wow, it looks like this particular verse that when we did a translation in the 1600s or 1700s, I mean, it was in the manuscripts we were looking at, but now that we have all of these older manuscripts, it's kind of telling that that particular verse isn't in any of them and doesn't appear until centuries into the game, like many, many, many centuries into the game. What do you do? Do you renumber the Bible? Do you just leave it in there because people were pretty sure it was original at some point or do you just put it in the footnotes? Well, the people in charge of the King James Version would say, nope, it was in there once. It was accurate. It was right. It's the God uniquely preserved the text of the New Testament through the manuscripts that were received by the people who made the King James Version in the 1600s and it's supposed to be in there. And so modern translations wrongly take these verses out of the Bible and they're messing with the word of God. People who have more confidence in modern translation would look at that and say, no, nobody's taking it out of the Bible. They got accidentally inserted into the Bible with the best of intentions somewhere in the late classical or earlier, mid-middle ages where it looks like probably some sort of scribe was trying to create a unity. They were trying to harmonize the accounts of these seven woes between the passages in Mark and Luke and Matthew. Well, in Mark and Luke, we get this remark that is included in Matthew in the old translations that would be Matthew 2314. Let's pick it up in Mark 1238. As he taught, Jesus said, watch out for the teachers of the law. I'd like to walk around and flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. If you'll recall, that sounds a ton like Matthew 23. Mark and Matthew situate this in the same place in the narrative timeline wise. So it makes sense that that corresponds really closely to the previous passage you and I have been looking at. Mark is associated with Peter. Peter is generally regarded by the ancient sources as being the source Mark drew upon for his information about the life of Christ. Of course, the source in Matthew would be Matthew because, well, it's Matthew and he was there. So I don't know. Peter remembered this stuff and Matthew remembered this stuff and it was really shockingly close. Maybe Matthew went to Mark or went to Peter and was like, Hey, I'm working on this thing. Do you remember exactly what was said there? Maybe super and actually the Holy Spirit super intended the whole thing. I know some people would look at this and say maybe all of this is just pieced together from data like any history project and there's no God behind it at all. Ultimately, part of the fun of our conversation is that you can do with the evidence, whatever you want to do with it. And we can get along just fine and enjoy the time together anyway. All of that said, at the end of Mark chapter 12, we get a little bit more. So watch out for the teachers along. The most important seats in the synagogue, places of honor at the bank with the eel started a charger, they devour widows houses and for a show, make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely. Oh, well, if you go and look in any translation that has a Matthew 23 14, it's pretty much exactly that verse. So if this is a later insertion into the text that is the result of a well intention described being like, wait a minute. No, that little thing about the widows houses and people being punished, that was supposed to be in there. Wasn't that in Matthew guys? Did we screw something up here? I think it's supposed to be there. So again, if you go to pretty much any English translation that has a Matthew 23 14, that business about widows houses and all of that will go after Jesus pivots out of the stuff about liking to be called rabbi and the greatest among you will be the servant. And there's all this other stuff. Then Jesus says, what do you teach to the law fairies and you hypocrites, you shut the kingdom of heaven and men's faces for you yourselves do not enter. Nor will you let those enter who are trying to then would get Matthew 23 14 that has this stuff about devouring widows houses. But in a lot of the manuscripts that do have this from the Middle Ages, there's disagreement among them in terms of where that verse that looks like it's from Mark actually goes. Some of those manuscripts have it placed before verse 13. So before the first of the woes, others have it placed after verse 14 right before the second woe, woe to you teachers of the law. So there's not even agreement in terms of where it fits in the text and we really don't see that kind of disagreement on verses anywhere else in the book of Matthew between the manuscripts So regardless of where people land, I think anybody who's being fair to the manuscript evidence would have to look at Matthew 23 14 and say, yeah, it's an omeleic that's different than anything else we get in Matthew in terms of a verse that appears in different places depending on certain manuscripts that you look at. I mean, the agreement that we have on the gospels between manuscripts is unbelievably stout. So it's a pretty big outlier to have that kind of disagreement and where the majority of that disagreement seems to be later in the game and the early tradition seems to exclude verse 14 and just roll straight from what we call 13 into what we call 15. In light of all of that, it looks like the evidence supports what we would call verse 14 being relegated to the footnotes, which is the case in pretty much all modern translations. In the same way that my buddy could call me up and be like, when did that story happen, though? I thought it was here. No, no, no, I think it was here. And ultimately, we don't know. What we do know for sure is that it did happen. And whatever that joke was or that thing was, is perfectly in keeping with things we definitely remember from our childhood. It's perfectly in keeping with things we would say and joke about. So while there might be very minor disagreement between the two of us regarding the exact timeline or circumstances surrounding that little anecdote between the two of us in the history of our friendship, no one is disagreeing that that thing happened and that the things we said are actually what we said. Likewise here, Jesus said that stuff, market test to it. And by proxy, therefore, Peter attests to it, Luke attests to it. And whoever he went and interviewed for that stuff attests to it as well. Why are we talking about this stuff? Well, because we're doing this with eyes wide open and being truthful about it. And if there's a manuscript controversy and I know about it, I think we should talk about that so that you can have that as part of your data set for deciding what you do with this book that has monumental implications. And so at the risk of offending some or even causing a mild crisis of weight, how does the Bible actually work for others? I think it's right to just disclose the processes that people go through for making sense of the manuscript evidence that we have and to acknowledge things that any smart attentive reader is going to catch. Likewise, they're verse 14. Normally when we count with numbers, you just count with the numbers right in order. And this time we don't count with the numbers or in order what gives. Well, in this case, we know exactly what gives. And if you want to dig deeper into this, it is not tough at all to go down the rabbit hole and do homework for yourself on the interwebs. There's a ton of reliable sources there. Thank you for being people who are so consistently gracious, even when we talk about things that could be provocative or make it feel like I want to be your enemy or pick a fight. I don't want that. I want to get along with all kinds of people who don't see every single thing the same way. What I really want to do is be honest with ourselves about the big questions in life and the data that supports it. If we lie to ourselves to make other people happy or to feel better about the process somehow, because we just don't want to be uncomfortable, we'll always know we lied to ourselves. If we do eyes wide open faith or even eyes wide open, not faith, at least we can look back on that process and say that was my very best attempt to do that honestly and not second guess our own integrity or bravery as we wrestled with a very important thing. All right, I appreciate you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast back to the text Proper, my Nyana.
