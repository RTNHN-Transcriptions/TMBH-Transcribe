 the they were friends and that's the ten minute by the podcast and have you seen the unbearable weight of massive talent with nicholas cage and uh... the red prince prince over in over in martell at the mandalorian paid row pass gal paid up as gal i haven't either so i can't really tell you anything about it or whether or not you should watch it but you need this podcast you'll figure out really quickly that the official stance of the ten minute by our podcast is that you shouldn't watch anything because it's all bad and it's all offensive and i don't recommend anything but i'll go and watch it as an active service in humility to all of you so i can tell you about things that get made that are definitely bad that you definitely shouldn't watch well this is one i can't recommend or not recommend because i haven't seen it at all but i saw the title i was like dang that's real stinking clever right there in a little while i'm gonna be talking about the parable of the talents and i'm gonna remember that that's the title of that show because i think there's like some kind of like why is in there again acknowledging that i have no idea what this movie is actually about it would appear to me that it might have something to do with the perceived unbearable weight of massive talent and that maybe nicholas is actually playing a version of nich cage that is somehow hyperbolic extended expression of the reality of the situation kind of the same way john claud van dam did in that very meta movie they came out in the two thousands and it's just called jcvd that was a good show and i also don't recommend it and the idea is that now when there's expectations on you that can be a tremendous burden to bear and that it may be a could even be crushing if that weight of expectations is unfairly placed upon one there was a show that came out in ninety nine it was magnolia uh... tom crews in phillips emore hoffman and uh... william h macy the guy who played the shoveler from mystery men and i think william h macy's character in that was like the kid genius who was on some kind of quiz show when he won everything and he had all of this talent and potential and the character was interesting because gradually over the course of his life the crushing expectations of society in the world in general because of the mass of a mount of talent he had the cruel expectations of society became too much to bear and he became washed up in a sad sympathetic character and and biddered character again i get the impression the nicholas cage is the same thing in this kind of deal and there's a reason this though rarely explored archetype is still one that we can relate to and it's because don't we all to some degree feel like life comes with potential like there's something i ought to be doing here is something i ought to be contributing and isn't that to some extent part of why birthdays and new years tend to be a downtime for most people because it's the passing of another year of age or year on the calendar and so this is christmas and what have you done for me christmas like in birthdays the exact same time years as a lot to reflect on because i knew you're just right after christmas you know this all is it's a lot baked in there but why why do we feel that expectation well at the most basic level i think we feel this pressure in this expectation because we understand intuitively that humans are full of potential and we feel that potential and people told us that we had potential when i do something with it we want to give back there's meaning somehow in life when we do that and it feels like we're just messing around things didn't quite work or we took a couple swings in the investments didn't pay off that can be uh... source of supreme lifelong narrative crafting disappointment and because that is such a relatable ever present cruel pressure that we feel stories about people crumbling under pressure or having this existential weight upon the stories that most of us even if like me or middling talent you can still relate to that pressure and that occasional sense of disappointment in terms of delivering where i'm going with all of this stuff or i'm going is a matthew chapter twenty five to get us into what is probably my favorite if not my second favorite parable in the gospel of matthew my three favorite parables in the bible are this one the parable of the talent that we're going to be talking about for the next few days the parable of the wheat and the tears that we talked about back in chapter thirteen and then the parable of the shrewd manager that i'm always referencing from over in luke this parable of the talents is one that transcends the bible goes beyond the boundaries of christianity of the religion of christian thought even the use of the word talent ed in a sense is a reflection of this parable so i'm just gonna read it to you out of context of course we'll look at it in context in the coming days and all of that but i just want to start on the existential side here i want you to think as i read this thing about what the difference is between the pressure that the characters in this art feeling and the pressure that william h macy's failed boy genius character felt or that i imagine it cages character feels in the sun bearable weight of massive talent movie or that maybe you feel from time to time on birthdays and anniversaries what's the difference between the pressure that these characters feel in this story from matthew twenty five and the pressure that do we feel on planet earth right here here we go uh... matthew twenty five fourteen jesus talking here again it'll be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them to one he gave five talents of money to another two talents and to another one talent each according to his ability then he went on his journey quick historical side note that we will explore more deeply in episodes to come a talent is a unit of weight so this is uh... ludicrous amount of money if we're talking about silver i assume since the translation is money that we're talking about silver in not a raw form but in a uh... tradable carryable for mike coinage of some sort of a government authorized silver here so much of it that is best measured in a weight and this is a lot of weight we'll talk about exactly how much money we're talking about the thing like crazy money crazy opportunity here is pressure that comes to that right now keep reading verse sixteen the man who received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gain five more so also the one with the two talents gained two more but the man who received the one talent went off dug a hole in the ground and hit his master's money after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them the man received the five talents brought the other five master he said you entrust them with five talents see again five more as master applied well done good faithful servant you've been faithful with a few things i'll put you in charge of many things come and share your master's happiness which is i mean that's a paraphrase now or i guess commentary would be the better word for that's just awesome isn't that what everybody wants is just that word of affirmations like your life has been lived in some way right you were shown potential you were given opportunity you paid it off the way you ought to have well done there's joy and good things on the other side come and share in that celebrated our first twenty two the man with the two talents also came master said you entrust me with two talents see again two more and his master replied even though it's only two talents is not a big a turnaround the master replied the same way well done good faithful servant you've been faithful with the few things i'll put you in charge of many things come and share in your master's happiness then the man who received the one talent came master he said i know that you're a hard man harvesting where you haven't sown and gathering where you haven't scattered seed so i was afraid i went out and i hit your talent in the ground see though here is what belongs to you his master replied you wicked lazy servant so you knew then that i harvest where i have not so gather where i haven't scattered seed well then you should put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when i returned i would have received it back with interest take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents for everyone who has will be given more and he'll have an abundance whoever does not have even what he has will be taken away from him and throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where they'll be weeping and gnashing of teeth the way these parables toward the end of math you work you definitely noticing there's a severe warning at the back end of all of them we always get to the severe warning part and i understand that it kind of colors the way we read the rest of it so we have their put a pen and we're gonna talk about it but let's go back to the basic introductory question of the day and that is this question of pressure that everybody feels drift trip trip all the time it's right there it's the pressure of expectations we put ourselves it's a pressure of expectations that other people put on us that society has this is a pressure that compounds with the passage of time or with failed investments are failed attempts to do something with it or it compounds even the most we don't even try to do anything with it because we're just paralyzed we don't know what to do so we have that pressure all the time but there's a contrast here because these guys apparently felt a pressure as well and two of the three responded to that pressure in a way that the parable holds out as being desirable they hustled they went and figured something out it was a big investment but they seem to have felt empowered by what they knew about the character of the master who had these expectations for them and because they seem to have felt great confidence in the character of the master it would be they were liberated a little bit like free to take these resources just try something go do it what do you know it worked out in both of these cases on the third guy seems to have felt an added pressure because he did not understand the character of the master and attributed to the master ill intent it was not accurate and when the master's like oh really so i'm this kind of person in this kind of person toward the end i don't think he's saying oh yeah i definitely report on so i definitely steal from my neighbors and stuff i think the master there's clearly using a rhetorical device to be like well if i'm as big a monster as you say i am i would tread lightly and we'll dig into that element of the response more later on but the fundamental differences the two guys who got a return felt liberated by a healthy pressure because they believed in and had great confidence in the quality of the character of the master and so as a result the crippling pressure that the third guy felt and that so often i think you and i as human beings feel in the nucleus cage maybe feels in this movie and that the boy wonder will you make me see character felt in magnolia that pressure was crippling was paralyzing for that third dude and he lashed out with blame and anger at the master over things that he really was inflicting upon himself and weights he did not have to carry around and having fear and self doubt and even character flaws like blaminess cripple us and paralyze us so that we don't do anything effective there's the big picture view over the whole thing obviously what we want to do next is like the contextual view as opposed to the contextless view think about why is this parable happening right here in matthew twenty five we're still in the middle of one big flow of thought about the end of the age and how things are going to work out in a kingdom view of the unfolding of history would be very easy for you and i to strip this parable of its larger meaning and just boil it down to what i think would be a very helpful life lesson kind of what we looked at today and just leave it at that but i think there's a ton more here and we're going to try and get into the ton more stuff that is here and talk about how that reads back into the parable of the ten virgins which were also not totally done with they came right before this i never know if i tell you enough but here we are at the end of an hour one of these conversations and i'm just thinking to myself i really like you and i really appreciate you and if i say that i'm always worried that maybe you won't totally believe me or you think that's just a thing that you're supposed to say when people make podcasts you're supposed to do that that's not how i feel i get to every single day turn on a microphone in my silly self important basement room and talk about things in a book that thinks really important like a normal person i get to act like myself and it's because you will receive that it's because you're gracious with me and you keep me from feeling a gigantic weight of heaped upon expectations that could be crippling and paralyzing and so they look at this passage today i just want to pause and express again my great appreciation for you this is an odd relationship we have mediated by an odd technology but how you are and who you are on the other end of this thing is very gracious and it's very life-giving to me and you mean a lot to me thank you i'm matt this is the 10 minute bible hour podcast let's do this again soon
