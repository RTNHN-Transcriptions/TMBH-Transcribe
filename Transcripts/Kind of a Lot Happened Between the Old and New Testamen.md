 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And as you just heard by that song, this is another bonus episode, but it's a very important bonus episode because we just finished up the Old Testament. If you're listening to this in chronological order, we just got done with Malachi, the last of the minor prophets. And we are about to turn the page one page. Listen to it. That's it. Over to the beginning of the New Testament in the Book of Matthew. Well, in between there, gosh, kind of a lot happens. There's a very significant gap in the resume right there. And in this bonus episode, what I want to try to do is fill in a little bit of that gap so that we are oriented when we step into Matthew. Because otherwise it's going to be weird that Galat has gone on. Their new names and new situations and new pressures and people's heads are in a new place at this point. They're worried about new things. The religion that we've been tracking has evolved a little bit. So we just, we got to lay the groundwork for all of this. The big significant empire when we wrap up the Old Testament is, of course, Persia. And again, of course, because you've been listening to this whole series with me, Persia took their power from Babylon. They displaced Babylon in 539 BC. Cyrus the Great. These are all names. I'm sure are starting to really stick with you by now. Cyrus the Great defeated Nebuchadnezzar and his son, the last king of Babylon and dethroned the Babylonian Empire for the title of the big dog of the ancient world. Babylon before that had defeated the Assyrians in the late 600s BC and Assyria from before 600 BC gone back for a couple hundred years. They were the big intimidating empire that was constantly causing problems. And then along with all of this, you always have Egypt way, way out west. They're on a separate continent. They got their own river. Everything just kind of works out there. Culture unto themselves every now and then they come out of hiding to go and have wars with people or people go and attack them. But when you picture the Old Testament story and indeed the flow of the story of the ancient world, I think it's okay to put Egypt off a little bit by itself. And occasionally the Venn diagram of Egypt overlaps. There's a little shaded area with some of these other groups. But then your first mega empire in the ancient Near East, the spitting distance of Israel is Assyria and then Babylon and then Persia. Now, again, Cyrus the Great is the first king of Persia. We see his name all over the Bible. Cyrus has a couple of sons who factor prominently. He's got Cambyses and Bardia, Cambyses rules for a little while and then dies under curious circumstances. Then his kid brother gets killed by Darius I before he ever really has a chance to get his feet under him. And then Darius I is the guy who solidifies the Persian Empire. He's also the guy who doubles down on Cyrus's mandate that the Jews should be able to rebuild the temple and the walls and Jerusalem and all of that business. Darius is a master administrator. And also he's got an eye for expansion. So he mixes it up with the Greeks way out West. This initiates a whole series of very famous wars that we've talked about a little and that you've heard about. And you've probably seen movies about between the Persians and the Greeks. And because most of our movies are put together from the perspective of the West, Persia tends to look bad. Greece tends to look good. It isn't really that simple at all. But Darius doesn't have the best of time fighting against the Greeks and he dies without getting them under control. That is the Athenians and the Spartans, etc. And so his son Xerxes, I was like, you know what, I'm going to go finish that off. So in the 480s BC, now we're into about the time of Esther. Well, exactly the time of that book Xerxes goes and has another campaign against the Greeks and it doesn't go particularly well either. This is the one where the Spartans under King Leonidas buy a bunch of time and hold off the gigantic Persian horde to buy time for the Athenians to set up their defenses under the leadership of politician and naval leader named Themostocles and then Persia makes its way finally down to Athens and they lose badly. And Xerxes has to go home. And there are handful more battles, but ultimately Persia never is able to really get the Greeks under control. Greece isn't like Persia. It's not a kingdom or an empire. It's a whole bunch of little independent city states that come together to form these leagues that are bickery and uncooperative and they do not have their business together in Greece at all. And then the aristocracy is wildly inefficient. I mean, it's a new idea. They don't really know how to manage it yet. And so Greece is fun and Greece is a powder keg of potential to disrupt the world and the Persians saw that. That's why they wanted to nip it in the bud, but they couldn't. So this lingering question as Persia gets into its golden age after the Greek wars is well, Greece settle down or is that whole Greece thing going to come back to bite the rest of the world in the but I guess we're fixing to find out. Well, there are all these other great Persian kings who come along. Art as Xerxes factors into the Bible narrative as well. There's some more infighting in Persia over who gets to be king next a couple of times. It's a great story that we're going to cover in more detail when we get into the book of Esther. But for now, we're going to fast forward a little ways from the era of Cyrus than Darius than Xerxes than Art as Xerxes, which takes us up into the mid 400s, the era of Ezra and Nehemiah, the rebuilding of the temple in the walls, et cetera. And we're going to fast forward to the mid 300s BC. And at that time, a Greek like a culturally similar Greek people from just north of what is considered historical center cut Greece, that being Macedonia, a people group from up there, they start to flex their muscles and particularly under one great king, Philip II. There's this massive expansion and a lot of these Greek city states start falling under the sway of the Macedonians and Philip II, who again looks enormously Greek, sounds enormously Greek culturally. It's very Greek, but there's a little bit of wrinkle there. This is not exactly your classical Greek people. And that's why the Greek age is sometimes called the Hellenic age, the Hellenes or Hellenic being an adjective to describe that, which is Greek. This Macedonian age is sometimes called the Hellenistic age, that being Greek-ish very similar to that. Well, Philip II dies under some nefarious circumstances and his 18 year old son, Alexander, takes the throne. Alexander was personally tutored by Aristotle. He was personally trained in the art of war by all sorts of elite veteran generals and talented military minds. And he knew his dad had an eye for conquest and well, young Alexander has an even greater eye for conquest. So the first thing he does is he pacifies all these Greek city states and brings them under his control. They don't like it. They push back, but between the reign of Philip II and Alexander, these Greek city states become Macedonian for all intents and purposes, govern mentally. Well, now that that's done, Alexander's like, I'm not shutting this down. We got this ball rolling really well. Let's go see if we can settle that age old score that we've still got lingering out there with Persia, their dumber and weaker. Now we should be able to take them. And so he grabs a whole bunch of Greeks, a whole bunch of Macedonians and a whole bunch of mercenaries, which is an old Persian trick. And he starts marching east following the route more or less that Xerxes had followed the other way to come and pick a fight with the Greeks. The hundred years and change earlier. Well, Darius the third is the king of Persia at this point. And he is no strategic match for the military genius and courage of Alexander the Great, who whips him in combat repeatedly with the battles of Issus and Gagamella being two of the most famous in that campaign on this trip. Alexander as a whole bunch of people groups are like, yeah, we're kind of done with Persia. Anyway, we'll side with you now included on that list are the people of Jerusalem. They welcome Alexander. They don't put up a fight. I don't know. Apparently the people of Jerusalem could read the writing on the wall and understood this Alexander thing was happening. The age of Persia was passing. And so they fall under the sway of Alexander. Alexander takes Egypt and sets up a city there that, hey, surprise, it's called Alexandria. You probably saw that one coming. And then he turns his attention back toward the east and starts marching toward Babylon, Persepolis, Sousa, the old historic capitals of Persia. And long story short, Alexander wins at every turn is unsatisfied, just conquering Persia. So he goes and tries to conquer a bunch of the Eastern allies of Persia, all the way as far as India. Ultimately, it gets a little bit tiring. He comes back to Babylon. And as a young man of only 33 years of age, he has succeeded in his goals. He conquered the entire known world or pretty dang close to it. He spread Greek culture and language and intermarriage everywhere. He seeded the whole world with Greek culture. He Greekified everything and the world would never be the same. Right after that, he died and he didn't name any error anything. He just died. And so now he's got a bunch of these elite generals who've been traveling all these years with them. They're all graded administration. And they're like, I guess we should just carve it up. And so they do. And you end up with three or four, depending on what period of time you're looking at. Pretty significant many empires that come out of the great empire that Alexander only briefly held. Well, initially, the people of Jerusalem are governed by the general Ptolemy and his descendants, the Ptolemies or the Ptolemids. They are headquartered in Egypt. And as a result, you start to see Jewish culture and writing flourishing now in really three different big geographic centers. They're still back in Babylon and in Persia because not everybody left when Cyrus the great said they could. So you got a bunch of Jewish culture there. Then you obviously got a bunch of Jewish culture in Jerusalem because I mean, there's a temple there. They're conducting sacrifices, obviously. But also because of the boundaries of the Ptolemid Empire, there are increasingly more and more Jews and academic Jews in Egypt. Now there'd been a Jewish presence there for a really long time. And it gets super interesting. And I want to chase it down in upper Egypt there were a couple of little enclaves and maybe that'll be an episode that I do at some point on my YouTube channel. But we see this big influx of Jewish presence and Jewish thought and Jewish culture to Egypt after the age of Alexander. Things aren't perfect under the rule of the Ptolemids, but things are definitely not perfect when the Seleucids, which is another empire descended from Alexander's generals, the Seleucids from Syria rest control of Jerusalem and Israel away from the Ptolemids. And they are much more committed to the Greekification of everything like Alexander had been. And so they start inflicting culture heavily on the Jewish people. Think about it. The Jewish people are very distinctive. Think about their customs and cultures and laws and heck, the scriptures makes them a very unique people group amongst all the people groups of the whole world that we've been looking at for this whole story of history. Well, that's a threat to the Seleucid emperors. And so they start to crack down. They start to do these obnoxious cultural campaigns to stigmatize the old ways and get people to embrace the hip, stylish new Greek ways. And this culture is bonkers. It completely jumps the shark during this time. It is so unfashionable to be Jewish for a little period of time that people are getting some kind of ancient world reconstructive surgery to make it look like they had never been circumcised for when they were competing naked in games or, I don't know, going to the bathroom, some public bathroom. Somehow people knew who was circumcised and who wasn't. And it was falling very out of fashion to look Jewish in that regard and not to look Greek. Well, as you might remember from the Old Testament, that circumcision thing, weird, though it might be, is a very distinctive mark of the covenant with Abraham. And it's an important distinctive that means something to this people group, even if it might sound foreign to some modern audience members. And so the entire identity of this people is under attack and the cultural values of the Seleucids are just bizarre and upside down and not sustainable. And I think people felt great despair during that time that any kind of common sense or values that could ever work for sustaining a civilization were all just vanishing in less than a generation. Well, the pressure mounts and the pressure mounts and this one emperor in particular, Antiochus Epiphanes is very threatened by the temple practices and the purity laws of the Jewish people. So he starts to mandate the violation of these laws. And somewhere in there, a line is crossed and a rebellion movement breaks out. There's an old priest named Matthias, who has five sons, one of whom is the famous Judas Maccabees. And they famously will not bend the knee to one of these little, oh, just do this thing. I mean, it's just one small gesture to demonstrate loyalty to your emperor. Just just do the thing. No, no, no, it's not that big a deal. We're just going to go ahead and have you do this gesture of subservience to the emperor religiously. Just just go ahead and do it. Not that big a deal. Just do it. I'm like, well, paraphrase is my near. If it's not that big a deal, then why do you care so much that I do it? But Antiochus Epiphanes really does care that they do it because he's slowly inflicting asserting his authority as a living civic God, if you will, over the people of Judea. Well, along comes this old priest named Matthias and his five sons. And they finally had enough and they refused to do a thing and then violently rebel against this action that was being inflicted upon them. A revolution ensues eventually Judas, one of these five sons, Judas Maccabees, emerges as the leader of this thing. And then they went, they throw off the saluted overlords and they experience a period of independence. Sometimes it's called the Maccabean period. You'll hear referred to as the Hasmonean dynasty. That's the name of a family of priests out of whom a lot of the kings of maybe all the kings of this era came. And it's really interesting when you go and look at this hundred year kingdom from one 64 to 64, maybe 63 BC, what you see here is a microcosm of everything we've seen through the Old Testament. The government doesn't work. The kingdom doesn't work. It's corrupt. You could write a book called Third Kings and just make it about the Hasmonean dynasty. And it would read like all of the calamities of First and Second Kings that you're familiar with. And the exact same thing happens in terms of international politics that happened back in the Old Testament that caused the Northern Kingdom and Southern Kingdom to collapse. They can't keep their business together well enough. So they have to start depending on these foreign powers, these outside authorities to make it work. And Rome is the significant authority at that time. So finally, in the 60s BC, the prominent leaders, the nobility of the Hasmonean kingdom appeal to Rome and are like, Hey, could you just come straight and some things out here? We're having some internal management problems and it's unclear how much help they actually wanted. But if you invite somebody like Rome to come in and sort out your stuff, they're not going to give back power a minute or two later. That isn't how governments work. Once they have the power, they keep it until that government falls or collapses with very few historical exceptions. Well, who the heck is Rome? I mean, I'm just dropping this name like we should all know what we're talking about. So let's hit pause here in our story at 63 BC with the very end of the corrupt and failed Hasmonean dynasty and go back and figure out where Rome factors into all of this. OK, Alexander the Great is doing his thing in roughly the 340s BC. Rome predates that by a long ways, but Rome doesn't really come up in terms of the big picture of what's going on in the march of historic. The Italian Empire until pretty late in the game because they're so far west. The Italian peninsula is forever villes away from all of the stuff that we're looking at in the Old Testament. It's way beyond the influence of most of the Greeks. There are some Greek colonies on the Italian peninsula and on Sicily. There's a significant Greek colonies there. But this little town of Rome situated on seven hills is not that big a deal. But the story of Rome going back to the 700s BC is one of one little tribe beating the neighboring tribe and then beating another neighboring tribe and then beating another rival tribe and just gradually winning every single fight, including fights against itself. To grow to this station of massive importance. Eventually, they control the entire Italian peninsula and then they become rivals with the larger Mediterranean or Western Mediterranean world and they start fighting with North Africa. People group from modern day Tunisia called the Carthaginians. And so by the time Alexander the Great has conquered quote all of the known world, there's a subtle miniature world way out west that has been left unchecked to grow and to develop a complex set of laws, a complex government and to defeat its enemies. Gradually in the second century BC, the 100s BC that is during the age of the Haspmonian dynasty in Israel. These upstart Romans accomplished what the Persians could not. They conquered mainland Greece. There's still some resistance there from Greek and Greek ish types all the way into the first century, a few decades before the time of Jesus. But Rome is growing unchecked and these little leftover empires, Alexander's generals, they're all failing. They're all collapsing under the increased pressure of Rome with the exception of the Tolamids in Egypt. They piled up with Rome and that bought them a whole lot of time. And under that increasingly expansive might of Rome, all of these empires that were born out of Alexander's generals are starting to fade and go away with the exception of the Tolamids in Egypt. They buddy up with Rome. Egypt becomes the bread basket of the Roman Empire. And they become very, very linked historically for a big chunk of time here. So by the time the wheels are coming off of the Haspmonian dynasty in Israel, Rome has conquered stuff all the way up into Britain. It has control of France. It has control of the Iberian peninsula that's Spain and out toward Portugal. It's got North Africa. It's got pretty much all of Greece. It's got Egypt. It is a monster of an empire and it has its eyes pointed east. Well, there are a couple of great political leaders at this time who you've probably heard of. Pompeii is one and Julius Caesar is the other. Pompeii is the guy who shows up to go and quote unquote help out the Haspmonians who were having a tough time with some flailing leadership over there. And when Pompeii shows up, he's mystified by the way that you think about the sacrificial system. And so he just goes into the holy of holies while he's there and is like, what's going on here? And that is a big deal because he doesn't die. And in the Old Testament, if you went and messed with that kind of thing, you died. And remember, there's this question coming out of the Old Testament about the presence of God. Where is it? Is it with his people already? As we saw hinted at by some of the minor prophets we've looked at, is it lingering somewhere else in the presence of God is going to return and dwell in the temple? Is it dwelling in the temple right now? Well, if it was dwelling in the temple, then he didn't do anything to Pompeii. That's weird. And that causes, I think, an emotional generational reaction to say we might need to take matters into our own hands politically here. And we need to get back to having our own independent kingdom. Rome isn't going to work out. And indeed, Rome proves to be a pretty heavy boot on the throat pretty quickly. And it's shortly after the time of Pompeii that Rome establishes a half Jewish sort of Gentile foreign leadership family to rule on behalf of a proxy ruler on behalf of Rome. This is the Herod family and the Jewish people are not crazy about this arrangement at all. And the Herod family, especially Herod the Great is always trying to compensate. Like, I'm just going to build a whole bunch of things. I'm not even totally Jewish, but I'm going to be the best Jew ever. I'm going to make you the best temple ever, better than Solomon, bigger and better than all of that. I'll fulfill that Old Testament prophecy that this new temple is going to be great on my own, just using sweet, sweet, sweet Roman tax money. And it's just a weird convoluted mess, but it's also a weird convoluted mess back in Rome as we get into the middle of the first century BC that is 50 years before the time of Jesus and moving forward. So we got the Herod family making a mess of things during that stretch in Israel, but in Rome, you've got the very famous assassination of Julius Caesar. It gets too powerful. Then the Senate doesn't like it and they kill him. And then there's a big civil war and you've heard of Anthony and Cleopatra. She was descended from the Tolomids. Anthony was the right hand man of Julius Caesar. They partner up in more ways than one and they have a big fight with Caesar's godson Octavian. And ultimately Octavian is the winner and he is established, not as the new first citizen of Rome, but he's established with a new title. Emperor of the new Roman Empire. And that changes the game dramatically. So now we don't have a Roman Republic that's governed by a Senate anymore. We really do have one guy who's at the head of everything, though at times the Roman Emperor is going to play along with the Senate for the sake of placating the wealthy and the nobles. But really it's the Emperor from here on out. Well, fortunately Octavian or Caesar Augustus, as he comes to be known, is a pretty competent emperor. And he's probably right up there in terms of quality with some of the other greats we've encountered in our journey through ancient history and through the Old Testament. He's up there with Cyrus. He's up there with Darius. He's up there with Nebuchadnezzar and some of the Assyrian kings who though awful were very, very talented. And so this is the guy who is in charge at the time that Jesus of Nazareth is born and the census or maybe there were two censuses that he called happen under Caesar Augustus's watch to try to bring order and stability back to a Roman world that was wobbling a little bit. But at that time, Caesar Augustus is calling for this census and trying to stabilize things. It would have to be acknowledged that part of what he's trying to stabilize from is the increasingly laughable late reign of Herod the Great who's just losing it. He's become paranoid and murderous and narcissistic. He keeps killing all of his own family members. He's creating his own succession crisis there. Herod the Great casts a very long shadow. He's a legendary ruler, but he dies very shortly after Jesus is born and Rome steps in like, yeah, we need to have a say and how things get divided up. This was kind of a mess with Herod the Great and they divide his kingdom into four parts and two of his sons each get one quarter, get one part of that now four part empire and they are called Tetraarks. And they try putting one of Herod's sons in charge of half of it. He gets the title ethnic. Now, ultimately that ethnic disappoints and we end up in a situation where you've got one significant descendant of Herod who really factors heavily into the story of Jesus. That is Herod Antipas. He's the guy who Jesus was on trial before he's in charge all through the life of Jesus. But then you've also got now Rome saying we need to be more present. We're going to put a governor in place there. And of course, the most famous Roman governor of Judea is Pontius Pilate who Jesus also goes before on trial later on in his life. So by the time we turn the page to the book of Matthew, which recording the birth of Jesus means it's starting somewhere around four or five BC, probably. We're in a situation that looks nothing like where we left off with Malachi. The Persians have come and gone. Alexander the Great has come and gone. The generals of Alexander have come and gone. The Haspmonian dynasty, the revolution has come and gone. The Roman Republic has come and gone. And now this new Roman empire that everyone's intimidated by that seems willing to rule with an iron fist, especially in a testy, difficult, problematic Judea and its neighboring northern province, which is also full of Jewish people, which is Galilee. These two spots are tricky in the eyes of Rome. And so they're going to come in hot and heavy to make sure things are under control with these Jewish people. And as you can imagine, there are going to be a few different responses to that. Some of the Jewish people are like, we need to welcome our new overlords. And we need to enjoy the presence of their boot on our neck. We seem to find a way to make the best of it and appease. There are other people who seem to have the attitude of, well, let's put our head down and wait. Hopefully this will blow over like so many of these other imperial moments have blown over. And then there are other people who are like, now we need to take up arms and we need to kill them. Now, within each of these groups, there would be a different mentality as to what that whole Old Testament Messiah business is about. Because remember, that's still floating out there, that there's this suffering servant who is to come, this descendant of David, who's going to sit on this throne forever. Clearly that wasn't reestablished by the Hasmoneans. So that wasn't it. But what is it? How can that happen with Rome right there? And so people are starting to shift gears to say the Messiah, he's going to be a general. He's going to be somebody who's going to come along. He's going to be mightier than Alexander the Great. He's going to be mightier than the Great Hannibal of Carthage who almost defeated the Romans. He's going to be mightier than Julius Caesar, Pompey, Magnus or any of these other great characters. He's going to be the greatest military leader ever. And he will establish a kingdom even bigger than Persia, even bigger than Rome. And then everybody will come to the new capital, which will be Jerusalem. And in that we will see satisfaction of what the prophets predicted about everybody coming to the temple and learning from us. And in that we'll be satisfied what was promised to Abraham that all the nations will be blessed through us. They developed a militaristic understanding of how those prophecies were going to be satisfied. That is one read on prophecy that is not exclusive to Jewish people. Lots of different expressions of Christianity have flirted with that over the centuries as well. It's a very tempting way to view a solution to the problem to say like everybody's gone crazy. Everything's broken. Somebody's just got to come with a sword and solve all of this stuff. But as we see when we turn the page to Matthew, those expectations are not met. That isn't who Jesus is. When one of his followers picks up a sword to maybe even rightly defend Jesus, Jesus tells him to put it down. This is everybody who takes up the sword is going to die by the sword. You live by the sword. You die by the sword. Jesus is not playing this game. He's not going to ride into Jerusalem on a war horse like Alexander did, riding into Babylon in conquest. He's going to ride in on a donkey. He's not only not going to wield the sword, he's going to tell people to put it down, reminiscent of that stuff from Micah and Isaiah about beating the swords into plow shares. He's not going to out maneuver people politically. He's not going to engage in court intrigue and use reputation, assassination to destroy his enemies and advance his own position. He's not even going to go and make a great argument in the courts to prove his innocence. No, he's going to be the suffering servant who comes as the Lamb of God, completing the ideas set forth in the sacrificial system. He is going to lay down his life to make a new family of faith to set up a system, a relationship between God and man that could actually work because through the whole Old Testament, like we talked about, we tried a zillion different iterations of relationships between God and man and none of them got it done. This calls for a new deal, a new covenant, a new relationship, a new mediator, a new situation. And not very many people are immediately ready for it or anticipating it when Jesus shows up in the book of Matthew. And one other important note about stuff that changes from the Old Testament to the New Testament is the bad guys. It's not really the Romans. Kind of they pull the trigger on executing Jesus eventually, but the bad guys are the religious leaders, the priestly class. They don't think Jesus is the Messiah. They don't think that's what a Messiah is supposed to look like. They think that certain controlling regulations and even an expansion of the rules laid out in the Old Testament is the best way to please God, to earn his favor and to bring about the changes they hope to see. Things have deteriorated into a cold, weird, dead, stale religion that has all kinds of injustice, just like the injustices we saw so often throughout the whole Old Testament baked into it. And so when Jesus shows up, he's going to take serious exception to what the religious leaders are doing in Israel and they're going to take serious exception to him. And that's a little wrinkle that on your first straight through read of the Bible, if you're coming at this cold, you might not anticipate. There's a ton more that we could dive into. And I mean, it's 400 plus years of history. There's so much that we could flesh out. But hopefully that's enough to fill in the gaps in this one little turn of a page and get us ready for the world that we're about to walk into as we meet Jesus of Nazareth and see this culminating moment in God's redemptive plan. And even though I just got done doing 800 episodes on this book, I for one am very excited to turn the page. And even if it's just for one day, get back in touch with our old friend Matthew next time around. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. You
