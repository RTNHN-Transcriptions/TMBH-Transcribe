 As we have discussed previously, my grandpa, my mom's dad, was for all intents and purposes a drill sergeant. He was a marksmanship instructor primarily in the Air Force, but dude, dad took his work home with him. I think would be a polite way to say it. I love my grandpa. He was awesome. That's him terribly. But dude was pretty assertive in terms of how he gave instructions. He definitely had expectations for us grandkids as to how we would pull our weight. He had expressions, lots of expressions for what pain he was going to inflict on us, little pukes, if we didn't get things right. One of the ones that I would hear him say a lot is, you get over here and do this thing, I'm going to box your ears. I don't totally know what earboxing is, but I also definitely know that grandpa never actually did that. He was never physically hard on me at all, but man was he intimidating. He would get up in your grill like drill instructors that you've seen in movies and he would get after you. He'd pull his hat down real, real low so you could barely see his eyes and he'd walk real upright and he'd just stickulate with his hands and point and talk about crappy work when he saw crappy slip shot. That's lazy garbage right and I'm like six. Maybe not six, seven. He would do that, but it was hyperbole, right? Grandpa wasn't going to be mean to me. He wasn't going to physically hurt me. He didn't actually mean that I was made of puke. He was just giving me a hard time in his own way. And admittedly when I was a kid, I didn't really get it. I felt like he was maybe a little bit mean and a little bit scary as I got older. I realized that that means I love you and I'm investing in you and this is how guys relate sometimes and this is how I'm going to pass along the wisdom I've learned and the discipline that I've learned to you and I value those memories tremendously and I miss him terribly. But the hyperbole was present and it was inarguably hyperbole. So question my friends as we go through this community of faith discourse in Matthew chapter 18 and Jesus leads it off with some pretty scary language. Is it a portent of judgment to come that Jesus is describing here or is he using some sort of hyperbole that the original audience would have understood and recognized as that figure of speech and they would have taken his meaning properly without imagining that horrible dismemberment should happen for them? And with that question in mind, let's look at the text. Matthew 18, start with verse one, why not? At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? He called a little child and had him stand among them and he said, Jesus talking now, I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heavens. Is that upside down kingdom motif thing again? And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. Oh, okay. There's that theme that we got at the end of the sermon on the Mount about responding right and imitating the kingdom values and how you treat people and what you do for others and what you do for God and stuff like that. A camp tracking. Oh, but here's the negative corollary. Verse six, Jesus goes on, but if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it'd be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. Jesus goes on. Verse seven, woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin. Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come. Jesus goes on. Verse eight, if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It's better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to sin, Jesus goes on, gouge it out and throw it away. It's better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. It's such vigorous language. And if you are the type who comes at the faith thing a little more philosophically like, okay, who is Jesus? How does the universe work? How does the notion of an all knowing God and all powerful God and the incarnation of a God? How would all of that work together? What's the nature of humanity and humanity's frailty? What do we glean from the Bible about the state of humankind? What do we glean from our own experiences? Who would God have to be to resolve that human problem? Where does death fit into there? If you're wired like me and you're really intrigued by those big deep water questions, then it can be a little bit jarring when we get to the parts of the Bible where Jesus seems to be speaking directly at people. And here, look, there's no getting around it. He's slathering it on really thick. So is Jesus here reveling in his role as judge? Is he delighting in all of this rather morbid, violent language? Is he eager to see people suffer for the ways that they've offended or wronged his father? Or is he using hyperbole like my grandpa did toward me toward ones he loves, in this case, ones who are a part of this new family of faith that he is creating? And is he using this hyperbole in a fashion that they would have understood in order to impress upon them the significance of what he is saying? You're smart. You can tell from the way I just framed that up. That was not a completely unbiased question. It was very, very leading. I think it has to be the latter. And again, we have that interpretive principle that we're trying to employ, not just in the Bible, but in all of our observations and interpretations of life and in relationships. We use this interpretive principle intuitively all the time, and that is interpret the less clear in light of the more clear. So when Jesus says stuff like this, is he really saying that theologically, if you cut off your hand or gouge out your own eye, then someday an eternity, God's like, well, we're just going to keep it that way. Old Captain One Eye, you still have to wear that eye patch and sorry about the hand stump, but that's not the kind of thing that we fix in Christian heaven. So good luck tying your heaven shoes sucker. I don't think he's tipping his hand pun intended about how the afterlife is going to work and what your body is going to be like in the afterlife. I think he is using figures of speech to be like, dudes, just do the math on what matters and what doesn't. Maybe if you've never met Jesus before and you haven't heard the other 17 chapters that are in here, this would be a crazy place to start. And you'd be like, whoa, it's a chopping off the, what are we doing here? But in light of everything else you've seen, when Jesus is like, look, count the cost, do the math. If this kingdom is the truest, realist thing, if these people are all made in God's image, if these people are all also sons, daughters, agents, heirs, children of the king, if everybody in this community of faith is a part of this new family of faith and can call God father because of the work God is doing and the work I am pretending to be Jesus right now and the work that I am doing, then that has implications and the implications are that you just can't be trashing people. You can't be wrecking other people. You can't be ruining people spiritually. You can't be ruining people physically. You got to think about the body and you got to think about the soul and the tender hearts of other people in a different way than you would in the doggy dog world kingdom values space. So I don't think the point of the passage is exactly what cruel and unusual punishment will be inflicted on you or should be inflicted on oneself. If you get this wrong, I think the point is the same as grandpa saying, I'm going to box your ears. Well, okay, maybe he's not going to literally box my ears, but it's very, very, very, very, very important that I follow his instructions on this thing and that I do the work the way he is telling me to do the work for reasons I get and for reasons I don't get. And if I get grandpa's project wrong, I might not get my ears boxed, but there will be consequences for getting that wrong. Likewise, I think Jesus is saying there are consequences for getting these community kingdom values wrong. But like we were talking about yesterday, this passage is about so much more than just individual naughty and nice. Did you scandalously do something scandalous toward that other person? Well, then you're in trouble, but it's not just that the passage is clearly teaching that there is also opportunity in getting this right. To have the kind of life that everybody dreams of having in terms of relationships, the opportunity to know and be known deeply with trust, the opportunity to meet other people's needs as they help to meet yours all in the name of the values of this great king and this greater kingdom and this truer, realer thing that actually lasts. So sure, if you don't follow the instructions that Jesus is lining out here and you're a kingdom citizen, there's the opportunity for things to not go right. But also if you do follow the instructions that Jesus is laying out for his son's daughter's children's heirs agents in terms of these kingdom values, there's tremendous opportunity for what can go right and to round out the point, not just for the person who does that, not just for the other person who's already a kingdom citizen who shares in that, but for people outside who might otherwise never be able to contrast world kingdom values with kingdom kingdom values other than seeing the beauty of what this stuff looks like in action. Getting these relationships right is a gesture of love and grace and invitation to people who are currently on the outside looking in. There's somebody on the other end of this scary command for Jesus. There are victims on the other end. He's describing victimizers, victimizing other people. And I know that's kind of a trigger word that brings up a bajillion different images and I'm not trying to conjure necessarily one set of images or another, but we all know what it looks like for somebody to have power or be in a position of influence or the position to shape somebody else and they abuse it and they use it wrong and they mistreat people. That's gross. And a lot of that stuff is going to go unchecked and unresolved. And that's just a pain that people get to drag with them. And unfortunately, probably all of us at some point in a big way or small way are going to be on the giving and receiving end of that. But in the kingdom, you're supposed to square that account up and you're supposed to get past that stuff. You're supposed to get past thinking of other people as something to be exploited in order to get ahead. So on the one hand, yeah, oh man, that language of Jesus is really scary about his judgment and his justice and the severity of it. And if we do interpret it as being a little bit hyperbole in nature, but on the other hand, hey, how about the part of your soul that cares about people who've been wronged? How about the part of your little childlike heart that got hurt by somebody and there was no recourse for that and there was nothing you could do about it. And you just had to endure that indignity or that slight or that unkindness or whatever it might have been. You want for there to be some kind of justice for that. And God is the one who's positioned rightly to do it. So what this indicates is that God sees that stuff. God sees those injustices and those wrongs and those violations against people in weak and vulnerable positions. And he's going to do something about it. The field is not untended. And in the meantime, part of what he's going to do about it is write down words like this, say words like this, so that people will feel convicted and be like, I can't treat people like this anymore. That's a world way to think about treating people in light of the reality of who God is and what the kingdom of God is like. I can't use my hands. I can't use my eyes. I can't use my words in these ways anymore. I have to conceive of people differently. And there has to be a tenderness and a grace and a patience and a mercy that I show to the people in my life who, well, are my peers or am I not peers, my leaders or the people who are in a weaker position than me. I think this is actually a beautiful passage where Jesus opens this community discourse with a bang and is like, Hey, here's how seriously I take justice. And here's how seriously I take treating people the right way within and external to this new family of faith, kingdom values and an encounter with the king must change the way kingdom citizens think about other people in light of how God chose to think about us. Therefore my opinion of this passage is scary, but good, scary, but necessary. Thanks for thinking about it with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
