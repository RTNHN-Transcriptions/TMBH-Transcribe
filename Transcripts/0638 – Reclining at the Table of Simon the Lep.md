 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and it is very nice to be back with you and current on the Book of Matthew. As we're chipping away at that, we're in Matthew 26 and we are just coming off of the instigation, the initiation, rather, of this sneaky, sly plot that Kaiaphas and his other religious leader buddies are putting together to get Jesus arrested in a way that won't cause the city of Jerusalem to melt down on Passover Week and have a big giant riot. People in Jerusalem, like they're just, they're really into the riots and Rome was really leery about the riots and their partners, the religious leadership, they were really wary about riots as well. And so they're playing it safe, but they're definitely backed into a corner and they're going to have to make a move here. They can't let the Jesus thing just go unchecked. So the question that we are waiting to have answered is how exactly are they going to make their move and what is Jesus and Team Jesus going to do in response to that. But we're going to have to wait to find out how all of that plays out because the next thing we get in Matthew 26 is this beautiful little interlude outside of Jerusalem, this calm in the midst of the storm. And that picks up in verse six and it goes like this, while Jesus was in Bethany in the home of man known as Simon the leper, a woman came to him with an alabester jar of very expensive perfume, which he poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. Okay. Bethany is a couple miles, maybe outside of Jerusalem. I don't know. I've only been there once and I got a little disoriented that town, those streets of the old city is baffling. I am a go places and become oriented like a homing pigeon kind of guy, that sort of map orientation thing is super important to me for some reason. And Jerusalem is one of the most scrambling places I've ever been for that. I know that there are probably plenty of landmarks to operate off of and people who live there surely have it all nailed down. But I never felt like I totally had my bearings that said, I do have a sense of where the amount of olives is in relationship to the old city of Jerusalem. And Bethany is somehow out in that neck of the woods, it's out in that direction. Bethany is the town that Jesus went to on his first day in Jerusalem when he went into town, everybody's excited. He flips over the tables. The kids are like, whoa, who's handed to the son of David? And then the religious leaders are like, hey, Jesus, make him stop saying that. He's just like, I'm probably going to let him keep saying it because the Bible from the lips of children and infants, you've ordained praise. And then right after that, in Matthew 21, it says, and he left there and he went out to the city of Bethany and he spent the night out there. So presumably Jesus is going back and forth to Bethany all the time. It's just he had connections there that we've talked about and that we'll talk about more. And so at this point, we're at the home of somebody named Simon the leper. Now here's what we know about Simon the leper, nothing. That's it. That's all we got. There's lots of Simon's in the New Testament, but not this one. Incredibly, don't have anybody to connect him with here. I guess you could assume that Simon the leper is no longer a leper at this point. Maybe that's the bummer nickname he got probably because of his, you know, leprosy. And if you go back to Matthew chapter eight, like the very first thing that Jesus did coming off the sermon on the Mount to demonstrate who he is and what his values were. It's an unclean person, somebody with lepercy came up to him and you knelt before him and he said, Lord, if you're willing, you can make me clean. Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, I am willing, be clean. And then the lepercy leaves the guy and Jesus tells him to go and do the ceremonial cleansing as his command and what we would now call the Old Testament. Was that guy Simon the leper? I mean, I don't know. But maybe could be. There's no reason to actually think that. And if it was the same guy, you'd think Matthew would have drawn that connection himself. I mean, why not draw the connection? It's symmetrical. Matthew seems to like paying off plot points like that. So no, I think it's safer just to assume that the Simon the leper guy is one, somebody we don't meet anywhere else and two, no longer a leper. Now, maybe he is. I mean, I don't know. I guess Jesus in light of what he taught about clean and unclean and those regulations in the Old Testament. I don't see any reason why Jesus wouldn't hang out with a leper, but it would have been pretty unpopular with other people to knowingly and publicly lounge around with somebody who has lepercy and then imagine you're going to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. I mean, you would be unclean from having hung out with that leper and that would irritate people because of how lepercy is contagious and you kind of don't want to get it. But the fact that this guy has a house and he just lives in Bethany says that for whatever reason, he just kept the name the leper. I don't know what kind of points he thought he was scoring with that, but he's long since over the lepercy and maybe everybody knew it. So whatever the case. The lepercy thing, it just doesn't even come up anymore. It's a Simon the leper. Matter of fact, that's whose house it is. And then while we're there, a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. Now, alabaster is a thing that jars can be made out of and it's of such a consistency that it could hold expensive perfumes without the perfume I'm making crap up. I don't actually know what alabaster is and I'm embarrassed, but I have my phone right here. Like I've heard people say alabaster before and I have, I know that they make jars out of it, but I'm being exposed alabaster. All right, here we go. It's a compact, fine textured, usually white and translucent gypsum drywall, often carved into vases and ornaments or a second definition, a hard calcite or aragonite that is translucent and sometimes banded. So it's like a stone, I guess it's a stone that's like carvable. Huh, how about that? Well now I know I have absolutely nothing else to say about the fact that the jar was alabaster. If that symbolizes something or means something, I guess I just would have needed more time to have known what alabaster actually is to have brought you that super intelligent insight. So we got a jar. I don't know if that's an expensive one or a cheap one, but the perfume is expensive. And then she pours it out on Jesus head as he's reclining at the table. Now the reclining I can picture at least, even if you go and look at old Roman art or Eastern Mediterranean art, this whole Mediterranean world, the whole recline at the table thing was it was how people did stuff. And let me tell you, I kind of think that was better. I like the sort of puritanical country kitchens at the old oak table and eat and elbows off the table, please. That's cool. But I like the idea of everybody just lounging around and taking your time and working through that food reel, slow like and having to be like, this is where we hang out. This is what we're doing today. So get super, super comfy. We ate at a place in Palestine with my family that was kind of by the field where they traditionally say that the shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks at night. And it was this kind of thing. Like it was very clear from the moment we walked in, you're supposed to be here for a while. And I super enjoyed it. They just kept bringing all kinds of different food. That was one of the more expensive meals I've ever eaten in my entire life, but it was neat because it was more than a meal and we got a long ways into the night. And even just, I mean, I was there with my family. So like I know them really well, my kids. But as the night wore on, the conversation changed. We had to pivot to all kinds of new places and we couldn't just observe our surroundings and comment on the room or the food. We found ourselves reflecting on the whole event and everything we were doing and what we were going to do when we got home. And it gave me a bit more of an appreciation for what this ancient classical Mediterranean style of dining does to your brain and does socially. So I can imagine this scene a little bit as we are well into the meal and people are serving. And it looks at like at this point, if Jesus is reclining at the table, he is accepting being served by other people. I mean, we know that right here around this time, he is also serving other people. The Son of Man didn't come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. He's washing people's feet. So, you know, this isn't a picture of a Jesus who's just above it all and like a prideful diner, but this would be completely appropriate for what would be expected of such a high profile guest who has done so much to serve the people there. Like especially if he's at Simon the Leper's house because Simon the Leper is like, Hey, I used to have leprosy, but now I don't. So I get to have a house again and stuff like, you know, since you're in town, I'd be really honored if I could whip you up a meal and we could spend some time together. I mean, it's pretty crazy. If you think about it that way, Simon the Leper like a dude, his name comes up once. We know nothing else about him, but right here in the middle of the most pivotal, important moment in like all of human history, he gets to grab a sit down and a bite to eat with Jesus for an extended period of time. What a unique claim to fame he has. And so it seems like Simon the Leper gets it. He understands the moment. He understands a big deal. This is. And it seems like this quote woman who came to him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, it seems like she also gets it because she's pouring out the entire thing, which she poured out on his head as he was reclining at the table. And tomorrow we're going to picture a little bit more about what that scene might have looked like and the reaction that that draws from people who are watching this very expensive thing just get dumped out all at once in this seemingly spontaneous moment. I thought this was a good day and also as a nice bonus. Now at least me and maybe some of you also learned what alabaster is. See that's a W thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
