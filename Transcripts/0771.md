 the everybody it's not this the ten minute by the way our podcast i am thanksgiving traveling which is what maybe sounds a little bit different in here uh... my in-laws place and i know in-law jokes they you're supposed to say some stuff right there are all supposed to roll our eyes but mine are great this genuinely very likable people and i'm super thankful to them all the things that they did to nurture and develop my wife into the amazing lady that she is so that i can have an amazing family with her and so as i'm recording this it is thanksgiving time and i find myself being very very thankful for those blessings in my life and i'm very thankful that you and i get to hang out and talk about the bible and that i don't have to feel enormous pressure to know every single thing about all the things because it's just a lot of things to know and it's way more fun and satisfying to sort it through with you to work through it with you to learn on the fly with you and one of the places where i've had to do that is in a conversation we've had a couple of times here over the last few weeks which is figuring out who on earth all these women are at the crucifixion and hint hint what's about to happen the resurrection of jesus because they're held out by matthew is being the faithful witnesses remember the book and thing where on either side of the crucifixion you get two sets of witnesses to those witnesses are real crappy witnesses will just say whatever they're supposed to say to get the conviction that they want who cares about truth but then on the other end we get gentile witnesses that being the centurion and the other people who put jesus to death and we get these faithful women outsiders but that's what a good faithful loyal witness looks like and the more i have gone and dug into the different comparative accounts especially the last part of jesus ministry jesus life the more i realize just how many of these ladies there were now we've talked a whole bunch about the mary's and that's going to come up again here in just a minute mariam other jesus mary magdalene then a couple other mary's who might be the same mary or maybe are all different mary's but on top of that you also have james and john's mom hanging out there and apparently a bunch of other women as well her just in a position where they're like hey i'm throwing my reputation i'm throwing my money and my energy at this guy he is the champion of outsiders as moms we know what it looks like to make a family and this guy is building a new family of faith and so they're all in in ways that i don't think we totally understand because of the distance in historical context how do we get how much it meant for a woman to drop what they were doing and follow jesus we always fixate on the uh... some men they were fishing and they had nets and they drop the nets and they follow jesus that is awesome but i think these ladies are a little bit underappreciated that said the amount of references we're getting to women to a first century jewish roman eastern mediterranean audience is kind of bonkers because that wouldn't score you a ton of social points and yet mathy mark luke john all of them are keen to point out these faithful loyal women and at the beginning of matthew chapter twenty eight or final chapter in the book of matthew did we get another reference to these ladies matthew twenty eight one after the sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week mary magdalene and the other mary went to look at the tomb they are not backing down they are absolutely insistent that they are going to stay present through this thing the reality is that usually dying puts a damper on things is kind of a wet blanket to most movements short of slows down the momentum in terms of people's enthusiasm for a thing you kind of quit believing that somebody's going to be able to come through after they die because of how they're no longer participating in the game they have become inanimate where they were once animate but these ladies out of a few possible motivations that will consider here keep showing up they're not over it they're not done now what might those motivations be okay we get the impression that some of the ladies were concerned that somebody was going to come and steal the body of jesus maybe they were concerned that someone who misunderstood jesus was going to do that maybe they were concerned that a well-meaning follower of jesus was going to come and try to steal the body to make a point a similar concern in that case to what the Pharisees had maybe they were concerned that the Pharisees were going to try to steal the body so that they could false flag the situation and then once everybody got excited make a mockery of it all by presenting jesus body once again i know maybe that's pretty far-fetched but i had fun imagining it whatever the case they think apparently the circle of women the body and indeed the dignity of the burial of jesus is somehow in jeopardy but i don't think that's the only reason they're milling around here i think they're still putting their name in their reputation on the line because they still think he's coming back to life now i couldn't begrudge them they don't have like perfect one hundred percent certainty about this is kind of uncharted territory who knows exactly how this works it doesn't work and maybe they're in a place where they're like well i mean he raised other people back to life at that widows son in that little village called nane you had that little girl back in high always get these two confused chapter eight no that's the beginning of chapter nine right whatever chapter eight or chapter nine and then most recently in the town outside of jersalim that jesus would last visit that being bethony near there laserus had been raised back to life how many of these marries how many of these women who are following him around were people who whose lives had been touched by loss my guess first century uh... all of them most of them at least and come on if you've taken a loss in your life you know what that does to you you know where your head goes you know if you've lost somebody you really love somebody really close to you you know the things you sit around and think about not even improbable the absurd scenarios that you play out in your brain about somehow getting them back somehow seeing them again these ladies and allow their brains to go around i'm sure everybody's brain goes when they experience loss but they had seen that absent-minded a dream that grief processing thing at least in a few circumstances play out as reality people who were dead no longer dead as though jesus were trying to signal to them repeatedly that even death for the power of god for to the establishment of this kingdom but again it's a little different when jesus there he's raised somebody back to life once or twice he's broken the laws of time and space repeatedly and he's alive but surely they couldn't help but wonder what are the crown rules now that he's dead who does the resurrecting who does the healing so my guess would be that on the one hand these women are there because they're wary of other people trying to pull stunts and they just want to be right on top of the chain of custody of the body because they are presented by matthew as being faithful effective reliable witnesses that means they're going to keep eyes on the thing the whole time maybe there's been a rotation of eyes on this whole affair the entire time and these women just took it upon themselves to be like nobody else is here we're gonna do it we're gonna watch this whole thing like hawks and see what goes down but i think the bigger motivation is even if they don't know what the mechanics of it are gonna look like or how physically this thing is going to actually manifest the confront of your eyes they still think this isn't over they still think jesus is coming back to life and so you said three days how do you count three days well talk about that soon too but they're gonna be there for it so my guess would be these faithful reliable witness women either as a group or maybe in a rotation have had eyes on this they've been covering this the whole time my guess is also that this is a peak time dawn on the third day and maybe your brain goes to Gandalf showing up at helms deep or some other military exploit and the winged asars or whatever heroic delivering force arrives to deliver it dawn on the third day and so maybe mary magnetlin specifically called this time slot was like i'm getting this one in the rotation because i think this is when it's gonna happen and how did we get to this third day thing well you recall twice in the book of matthew jesus has referenced upon the Pharisees demanding of him a sign he's referenced that the only sign they're going to get is the sign of jona and then he goes on to say that in the same way that jona spent three days in the belly of that fish so the son of man will spend three days in the belly of the earth jesus has also alluded to his own death indicating that there would be a turnaround that would look like this you'll recall the accusation of the witnesses that jesus apparently had said that he would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days so everybody's looking at that number real curious holding their breath of course everyone is strategically out of no doubt self-preservation motives holding their breath and watching from a great distance except joseph verimathea and nikadimis who put their neck on the line for this and these women who are putting their necks on the line for this all the time and to just simply refuse to go away and quit watching now you and i have talked about the roman division of time how the different hours work dividing that into four-hour chunks and how there's a little bit of ambiguity in terms of how you would count time you recall the there's some debate about all the timelines of the crucifixion day to they all work between the different accounts and my feeling is well yeah they work and i suppose tomorrow will break down a little more carefully why i think mary magdalene and the other mary or so keen to be there right at this moment because i think they've done the math and i got a few said three days this would be how you would count three days but i don't want to attract from what the larger point is for today mary magdalene and the other mary and all these other women who are here right at this second but they've been keenly interested in what's going on their faithfulness is set to be rewarded their faith is about to become site the text here says they went to look at the tomb usually you go look at a tomb you muse at a gravestone of somebody lost there's not a lot of action there but you get the impression from the rest of the text that they anticipated something might yet be cooking here and indeed in the very next passage we're gonna see matthew pull the book and trick again this time with a violent earthquake that happens right at the crucifixion as jesus dies and now as jesus is resurrected to life we get that same thing happening again we're gonna break down all of this stuff way more tomorrow i can't wait to unpack what's next with you tomorrow and that is the ten minute by blower podcast this is the
