 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Nehem. If you just pick up a Bible and start reading straight through it, you will get a whole lot of Nineveh in the book of Jonah, which describes events that happened in the mid-ish 700s BC. Well, at least part of it happens in Assyria, this great evil nation to the north that oppresses people, and everybody around Assyria hates Assyria and cannot wait for Assyria to go away. And as you'll recall with Jonah, he doesn't even want to go preach there, because he's deep down, suspicious that God is going to relent, and that he is going to forgive the people if they repent. And so he's fussy, and he goes and he phones it in and does a terrible job, a tank job on his preaching, but for some weird reason, the king of Nineveh relents, and everybody asks for God's forgiveness. And sure enough, God's like, okay, I'm going to spare all those people. That's a lot of people. Even a few more prophetic books go by, and the next time we get a really good look at Nineveh is in the prophetic book that we're looking at today, which is Nahum. This book is written about a hundred years later, and kind of a lot's happened since we last saw Nineveh. For example, one of the two most notable things that has happened in Nineveh in the interim totally forgot all of that stuff about Jonah, and what they said they were going to do, and the repentance thing and all of that business, it did not stick. Maybe it did for a generation? I don't know. It looks like in the reign of Jeroboam II, who was the king in the early 700s BC, up to somewhere in the mid 700s BC in the northern kingdom of Israel. It looks like during that time of Jeroboam II, Israel was really powerful and able to expand their borders as Jonah predicted they would be able to. They were able to do that because Assyria was in a downswing. We don't know exactly what the problem was there, but there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Assyria was having a leadership crisis, and they were wobbling at that time. Maybe that's why the people of Nineveh were in a place where they were willing to respond before they weren't the big dogs anymore. They were a little shaken, a little uncertain about their future, but we also know that after that time that Jonah was up there, things got back on track pretty quick for Assyria and Nineveh, which is a big Assyrian city. And as soon as they pulled it back together, they got back to conquering and being very, very violent and evil and oppressive as they had always been in the past. So I'm guessing that the Ninevites were like, yeah, I don't know. We're good now. We can trust in our swords and spears and chariots and our money, and we'll just move forward, kind of forgetting that embarrassing incident where we acted like we believed in a foreign deity. Actually, speaking of that foreign deity, we should go conquer those people. And I guess that's the second big notable thing that happens between the scene and Nineveh in Jonah and the mentioning of Nineveh that we're getting here in the Book of Nahum is in 722, the regrouped retooled Assyrians comes out and they conquer and completely destroy and subjugate the northern kingdom of Israel. Boom, that's it. Gone to history. Well, a few years later, they decide to press their luck a little further and go and attack Jerusalem and only barely, perhaps because the good counsel of Isaiah and Micah were still floating around. Only barely does King Hezekiah depend on God enough to see God's miraculous deliverance and to sustain the southern kingdom of Judah for what would end up being about another 125 years. So in a way, Nahum is kind of the follow up to Jonah and get that loose end flapping around. Well, whatever happened with the Assyrians, whatever happened with Nineveh up there, Nahum gives us an answer. They reverted in a lot of ways they were even worse than they were before, and now they are the object of God's wrath. For a long time, everybody's been wanting to see Assyria go away. But now God has decided it's time for Assyria to go away. So in the most literal sense, then, Nahum's book is dedicated to predicting the complete ruinous destruction of Nineveh at the hands of the Babylonians and indeed that did happen in 612 BC. Now, you might be thinking, all right, we've looked at a lot of these Old Testament prophets and there's always some judgment stuff in there, but then there's also some stuff about the descendant of David raining on the throne and God straightening everything out. It's not quite as present in Nahum though. What we get here are a few verses at the beginning that draw on language from other parts of the Old Testament, particularly Exodus 34. And it's a statement of the glory of God and the character of God and also why you should be afraid of that if you're an evil oppressive empire. The Lord is a jealous and avenging God. The Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies. The Lord is slow to anger and great in power. The Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm and clouds are the dust of his feet and you, Nineveh are about to reap the whirlwind. This little opening bit that talks about these positive attributes of God who is a God of justice who will defend the oppressed, that section wraps up with this very well-known beautiful line. The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him. And then we get a hard pivot for the rest of the book of Nahum into Nineveh. Yeah, your time is up. You're going down. It's going to be at the hands of Babylon and it is going to be ugly. And the tone of the whole book is more or less, hey, when you're being towered over by your enemies and they're about to shame you and run you through and when nobody comes to help you and you are defeated and alone and everyone you've oppressed celebrates your defeat, just know that was me, God. Obviously, I'm paraphrasing a little bit there, but I do think that characterizes the tone of the book. We get here to the end and it says, Oh, King of Assyria, your shepherd slumber, your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them. Nothing can heal your wound. Your injury is fatal. Everyone who hears the news about you claps his hands at your fall for who has not felt your endless cruelty. The end. That's the end of the book. There's no little pick me up positive encouraging thing at the end. The intonation of the book is that unless you are an evil, oppressive, vile, violent, horrible, wicked empire, you're going to like this book and you're going to like what happens to Nineveh because they had it come in and it needed to happen. And back to the actual historical details of Nineveh's defeat. When they went down, they went down hard. Nineveh got consigned to the sands, forgotten to history so much so that critics of the Bible in the 1700s and 1800s, here's just a couple hundred years ago, looked at Nineveh and they were like that right there. It factors so prominently in the Bible, but if there was really a city that was that big a deal and that was that big, it would still be there. Maybe the Bible is fake, probably the Bible is fake, they would say. Well, then some people go and dig in the right place in the desert near modern day Mazel Iraq and sure enough, there's Nineveh right where it should be. And so much of what you see in the British Museum from the age of Assyrian art is all from Nineveh, which got utterly toppled and wrecked by Babylon, which would have been cathartic in ways I'm not sure you and I could understand to the original audience here. But there's a bigger point to Nahum and that is in keeping with the bigger point of the book of Joel. You remember that one? Joel doesn't really have a specific target. There's not like you, this country, you're in trouble. It's the nations. The God is going to judge the institutional evil and the specific evil and the evil leaders of the nations that don't think for a minute that this stuff is going to go unchecked and just be allowed to breathe. It might not happen on the timeline that you and I would like for our sense of justice, but God sees it. He will judge the nations. There will be this grand day of the Lord, as I suppose in a sense, there is a day of the Lord described in Nahum, a terrible day of the Lord for Nineveh. So there will be this grand day of the Lord where God corrects this injustice and straightens these things out, not just to the benefit of one singular little narrow group of people, but to the benefit of this grand new we discover family of faith that is going to be created in Jesus. Nahum's a banger. I like this book. Nahum is fast and hard hitting and intense and I like it. And when you visualize it, just picture Nineveh in ruins. When you think about the theme, reflect on God bringing judgment against all the evil and oppression of the world, the stuff that you know deep down at the level of the soul needs to be straightened out as well. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least read the first eight verses. You might be getting through these prophets with me and being like, wow, God's judgment against everybody and everything is going to correct all this evil. And you might be thinking like, what about my evil though? Cause I have some stuff that I've done, just thought and it hurt some people that probably wasn't the best thing ever. What about that? Well, that question is supposed to be one that we are grappling with and thinking about. And in that regard, the Old Testament prophets by just hammering this tone of God's justice and his judgment are meant to point us to what happens with Jesus as we get to the New Testament. That's sort of the big payoff. All right, my friends, achievement unlocked on Nehum. Next time around, we got Habakkuk. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
