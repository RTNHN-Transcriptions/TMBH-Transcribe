 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. And whether you've ever played tennis or not, I really think this next thing is going to make sense. But if you have played tennis, it's going to make bonus double sense. Tennis seems like a game where you wouldn't have a lot of offense and defense from the outside looking in. It seems like you just sort of hit the ball back and forth and whatever. But in reality, at times during the course of play, you are much more on the offensive. And at other times, whether you like it or not, you have to respond to what your opponent has done because they have the advantage for the moment or at least it seems that way. So if I hit a real soft ball just over the net and my opponent is able to move up real close to the net, they get to just mash away at that and hit it at me. And I'm probably not going to hit the game winning point off of that ball. I have to answer that shot. I must reply to it and I must reply to it defensively. But maybe my defensive shot is good and it pushes them back a little bit. Maybe they take another big swing and I still have to answer. I still have to respond to what they did. But now I'm in control of the point and I move up into the court and now they have to start responding to what I did. And hopefully I can finish things off taking advantage of that and win out that point now that I'm in the driver's seat. This is also very normal when you are having conflict oriented conversation with people who see it way differently than you. There's offense and there's defense in conversation. And you really can't afford to not address offensive attacks that get thrown your way or it looks like you're conceding those things. You're just saying, well, yeah, that's obviously true. But now here's a red herring of something else. No, you have to address it. It's not a sign of weakness and you kind of have to do it before you can go on the offensive. If you understand those rhythms to tennis or those rhythms to life and conversation, then you will have no trouble understanding what Jesus is doing here in Matthew chapter 12. Starting in Matthew 12, 22, there's this demon-possessed man that people presumably of good will bring to Jesus to have healed. And the demon possession is manifesting apparently with blindness and muteness, which Jesus heals upon casting out the demon. And people are like, whoa, that's really cool. This guy could be the son of David, the Messiah. But verse 24 says, but when the Pharisees heard this, they said, it is only by B.L.'s above the Prince of Demons that this fellow drives out demons. And then Jesus has to hit that offensive shot. He has to reply to that. So I wouldn't say defensively like, when he just back off, leave me alone. Now like, you know, petty defensively, but you have to honor the shot defensively. He hits two defensive replies back at them. Number one is it doesn't make a lot of sense of Satan as is dangerous as you say is that he would be driving out himself and fighting himself. That would be a really lame bad guy. And number two is, well, if I drive out demons by the Prince of Demons, then who do you guys drive out demons by? Because you guys do the exorcism thing, right? So are you channeling demons too? Oh, it's from God. And how come your stuff is from God? Massive paraphrases mine. So Jesus does these two defensive maneuvers, but now look out. You had a chance to put them away, but you didn't get it done. And now Jesus is on the offensive starting in verse 30. He says, whoever's not with me is against me and whoever doesn't gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or the age to come. Well, from a narrative perspective, this is just fun because Jesus is like, I'm at the front of the net now. Here come a couple bullets your way and I know you guys can't handle them. And so if you've ever played sports, you've heard that good defense translates into good offense. And so offensive maneuver number one from Jesus here rolls right out of those defensive shots that he just hit where he logically worked to the conclusion that the spirit of God is who is making it possible for Jesus to cast out demons. Since that's the case, the kingdom of God is here, but Jesus says as he mashes their lazy tennis shot violently back down their throats, if you're not with me, you're against me. Therefore, if you're not with me, you are against the spirit of God. You are against the kingdom of God. You are against the very thing that you're the keepers of the supposed flame for and telling everybody to look out for. So then he takes it even further as they limply kind of deflect that shot and give him one more opportunity to mash away. He comes back with this. And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven. Jesus just showed that his critics can't deny that what Jesus is doing is from God, is of the spirit, is representative of the kingdom of God. Jesus reminded everybody of what has already been made abundantly clear. That is that they are not with him. They are opposed to him. And therefore his conclusion is you guys are opposed to the spirit. You're opposed to God and your attribution of the miracles of God to be yells above. The prince of demons is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. You just saw that miracle happen right in front of your face with no other plausible explanation and you're still not going to acknowledge the work of God. That is blasphemy against the spirit. Now I think it would be fair of Jesus to just say this because his judgments are right and he knows what they're thinking, but he isn't drawing this out of thin air. There's some stuff from the Old Testament and even from some Jewish apocryphal non-canonical in any version of Christianity books that hint that this blasphemy against God was the height of evil, the thing that was unforgiven. So it's possible that when Jesus is saying this, he's drawing on some written traditions, parallel to the scriptures and some oral traditions that these guys would have been familiar with to hit them with their own belief that profound blasphemy and rejection of God is the one thing that is unforgivable. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. That's very generous considering that there was an audience there. There's a bunch of people following him around. And remember, Matthew presents three types of audience members throughout his gospel. You get the people who are really in, like the disciples. You get the people who are really out, like the Pharisees and teachers of the law, who we're talking with here, who are grouchy. And then you get the squishy middle crowds who just aren't sure what to make of it. So Jesus is using some pretty thoughtful and pretty nimble rhetoric here to make sure that he's continuing to articulate patience with those crowds saying like, surely there were people there who had said some nasty stuff about Jesus, but now they just saw this miracle and like, well, maybe that's the son of David. So there's some patience there if you want to rip on Jesus, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit, he goes on to say, will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come. And that sounds quite a bit more definitive and final. And in making that remark, Jesus is differentiating the earnest, questioning doubt, still trying to figure things outedness of the squishy middle crowds from the angry, hostile, murderous, prideful, blasphemous thoughts and actions of the Pharisees. And like I said a minute ago, I think that's all pretty evident from a narrative perspective. I doubt you and I are probably having any kind of vigorous over the podcast airwaves disagreement about how to read that. But where there might be room for friction or disagreement or confusion about how to interpret things is what this means for you and me. Does this mean that if you say words that are critical of the Holy Spirit, like I don't know who does that just over the coffee or just you wake up one day and you're like, I'm going to say some mean things about the Holy Spirit. I don't even know who does that. But does this mean that if for whatever reason you did say that combination of words, that is unforgivable and you are anathema and cast out from the kingdom with no hope of redemption. Well, some people would say, yeah, that's the best read on the passage. Other people would look at the passage and say, no, Jesus is talking about miracles that were happening and people should have believed in the miracles and believed in Jesus as a result and to be critical of miraculous claims and not believe even modern claims of miraculous work. That would be blaspheming the Holy Spirit. So you better tread very carefully there with your skepticism. Maybe, but that interpretation doesn't seem to square with reason or scripture because you have examples of other miraculous looking stuff happening. I mean, the wizards in the court of Pharaoh back in Exodus seem to be able to at least somewhat duplicate the miracles of God. You've got Simon the Sorcerer coming up and what is that? Acts chapter eight around Acts chapter eight. And it looks like he can do some stuff that's kind of impressive. We've got all of these extra biblical references to magical papayra and people performing things that looked like exorcisms using jewelry and incantations and all kinds of bizarre stuff. That's well documented, but the biblical text doesn't seem to indicate that that's from God. And further, John writing after the gospels were written in, what is it, first John? His first epistle is pushing back on people being rubes when it comes to prophetic claims and miraculous claims. He's like, Hey, you guys got to test the spirits. There's a separation that you are equipped to do from the good stuff and the bad stuff. False prophecy and real prophecy. And he points toward orthodoxy regarding the nature of Christ as being one of the most basic tests. So as is the question of how this passage applies to you and me now, I guess some people would say, well, just the combination of words that are blaspheming of the Holy Spirit. It's unforgivable. Yeah, I'm skeptical of that. Some would say if you think or speak critically of any claim of the miraculous in the name of Jesus, that would constitute blaspheming the Holy Spirit. I'm skeptical of that. I think an interpretation I hear often that has more credence, maybe isn't fully complete, but makes more sense to me is the idea that ultimately rejecting the Holy Spirit, rejecting the redemptive work of God, the culminating kingdom work of Jesus is to cut yourself off from being a part of that kingdom. Therefore, just rationally, I guess that would be the unforgivable sin because there's an overt and final rejection of the Son of man and of the Spirit and of the work of Jesus on the cross and of the kingdom and of all of that. So in that sense, yeah, I suppose Jesus is just saying something that's logical and self-evident for us today. If you reject the Holy Spirit and all of this other Jesus God stuff, then that naturally would have a separating effect from the Holy Spirit and all of this other God stuff. A fourth and final read that I hear on this passage from time to time is the read that says that this is an unrepeatable sin, that there is something unique about the moment here where the Pharisees were uniquely equipped, uniquely positioned, had uniquely seen the miraculous work of God and immediately on the spot attributed that to demons. This is all the things that were prophesied in the servant songs of Isaiah, prophesied with all the stuff that points to Jesus was being fulfilled right in front of their faces. They are actively rejecting it with empirical data of their own as it is unfolding. And so some folks look at that and say, that means that this really isn't a repeatable sin because no one in the audience reading it now is positioned with the same degree of accountability that the Pharisees would have been at this point. Ultimately, the cool thing about the nature of our relationship is that you can just make it out whatever you need to. I don't know, it's a hard passage. I can't hide my biases here. I think some combination of option three and option four probably make the most sense. But rather than feeling some kind of pressure to solve this right this second because it just happens to be the passage we dealt with today, I think the beauty of the exercise you and I are going through is you can just take your time. Now you can just have your antenna out for this question as we bounce back to earlier passages as we inch our way forward into new passages and interpret this thing in light of the whole instead of feeling like I have to answer this right now and the world needs to know my stance on Matthew chapter 12 and stuff about blaspheming the Holy Spirit. Like we can just take our time and we can think about that. Whatever the case, Jesus is still on the offensive. He's not nearly done. He's taken over the point and we are going to look at more of what he does now that he's taken over the point tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
