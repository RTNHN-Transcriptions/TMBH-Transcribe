 My dad retired from decades of doing church ministry this week. He's a pastor forever. He's really good at it. It's kind of my hero. He and my mom who are absolutely wonderful, great parents, great role models and teachers and shepherds for so many people. They finally had their last Sunday of church was this week. Mom's the consummate pastor's wife is dedicated, committed, humble, helpful at every turn, encouraging and dad is a great pastor. Excellent scholar, wonderful at honestly approaching the text. He's great at knowing how to talk to the people in the room. He's excellent at the in person thing. He's got very broad shoulders and can absorb all of the stuff from people's lives year in and year out. And there's a lot of stuff being born, dying, sickness, health, it sounds like wedding vows, but all the stuff in between the great stuff, the tragedies. He's just done a wonderful job. And as I was talking with him on the phone, as he's driving away from church, because he's done his stuff's packed up. He's headed to his new place. He's a pretty weepy conversation and not because he has regrets and he's doing the Oscar Schindler thing. He's like, Oh, this ring. I could have done one more Christian thing if I'd sold that. He pretty much has already done that. The dude has not made any effort to accumulate. He just gives and gives and gives. I think partially that emotion I was hearing is the identity thing. You do anything for a really long time and it becomes a little bit of who you are and how you know where you fit in society and what gives you meaning and purpose. And now he's moving on to another thing. I'm sure that's intimidating, but most of the emotion I heard was this big exhale from trying really hard to do really good things to make a difference. Dad became a Christian in the driveway of his house in Torrington, Wyoming. He was going to a youth group with a very fundamentalist, I think African inland missionary guy who was home on furlough and you know, fundamentalist, I sound like I'm being hard on him and I'm eternally grateful to this missionary because he presented the gospel to my dad. My dad responded to that and as a result it has had this huge ripple effect on tons of people. I think the ripple effect is what dad was interested in as we were talking about this idea that somehow this little thing, this little seed of the truth, who God is and who Jesus is and what the kingdom is and what the kingdom values are and what the point of life is. That's something that took root in him when he was a 15 year old kid in the driveway at my grandparents house and it's something that I think he was evaluating as he was driving away with his stuff loaded up yesterday trying to think through did I give all of that stuff away and did I do that sufficiently or what more could I have done and his church had a great job of propping him up and pointing out all the ways that he did get that stuff right. So I'm listening to him emotionally processes through with all the road noise in the background from the Bluetooth and all of this and I think and what are we talking about you and I here on the podcast right now is Matthew 13. It's the parable of the sewer. These four types of soil and what is the ideal type of soil do? Well, the seed lands on it. The seed that contains the message and the values of the king and the kingdom and all of that and then it takes root and it grows up into something that is incredibly productive and to quote Jesus Christ the guy for whom Christianity is named. Still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop 160 or 30 times what was sewn. Nice job, dad. I think you got that done and I don't think you're done accomplishing that kind of stuff and I don't even know dad if you even listen to the podcast, but I'm really proud of you and I love you and thank you for what you've built into my lives and the lives of so many people and thank you also for being a helpful illustration that will help us to better understand Matthew 13. So Matthew 13 verse 18, Jesus jumps back to the parable that he explained at the beginning, the parable of the sewer and he gives his blow for blow explanation of what it's about to the disciples who clearly are a little bit confused about how parables work. So this is Jesus talking. And then to what the parable of the sewer means, when anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sewn in his heart. This is the seed sewn along the path. You remember this is the one where the birds came. They picked at it and they took the seed away and it never had any chance and it was on a path that just didn't work out. Still pretty cool that the sewer was like, I'm going to give you a chance, even though you're obviously a path and there are birds all around here, but you know, we'll see. So the idea with this first kind of soil is the message is D.O.A. The evil one, I assume we're talking about Satan, Lucifer. I guess I didn't dig deep into what the evil one looks like in the original language, but I think we're all tracking with what's going on here. There's some kind of spiritual element here and that type of soil falls prey to an entity that desires its destruction. It does not want to see that seed take root there. How does that work in the spiritual realm? I don't know. It comes up from time to time in the Bible. Some people are very sure that they've got all of the riddles and ground rules solved in terms of spiritual warfare and good versus evil in the unseen realms and they point to something in Daniel where there's like some kind of spiritual wrestling match and I don't know. I'm just not convinced by any of their cases. So specifically, I'm happy to declare ignorance on how the spiritual tension works between good and evil in the general sense, though. I'm pretty comfortable saying that the Bible indicates that it exists and somehow there will be a resolution to it when God ultimately defeats evil. So we got that first type of soil where things just don't work out at all. And then verse 20, Jesus says, the one who received the seed that fell in the rocky places is the man who hears the word and it once receives it with joy. So kind of like my dad, he's 15. Nobody had ever been a Christian in his family before. And well, when he was done, like everybody was his siblings, his parents, aunts, uncles, everybody. But at that point, he's the only one. So there's a seed that falls there and the person hears it receives it with joy. But as the story unfolds, we see, no, this isn't like my dad. But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the word. He quickly falls away. Now dad had persecution and difficulty and pretty serious questions from his family about what he was getting into and what this was. My mom had the exact same experience in being the first person in her family to ever be a Christian at about the same age that dad was becoming a Christian. But no, I didn't break him. So the evil one didn't pick off my parents and persecution and hardship and difficulty didn't pick off my parents either. So no, the second type of soil looks like it's going to be a go, but it's abortive because of these pressures and the persecution. So ultimately, this one just doesn't take the path of least resistance is apparently what gets chosen. Verse 22, Jesus continues. The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of his life and the deceitfulness of wealth, choke it, making it unfruitful. So again, it looks like this one is going to be a go, but the problem with this type of soil is that it's indiscriminate. Everything grows there. Have some thorns, have some milkweed, have some dandelions. So have the seed that represents the data packet of the kingdom. Just everything works. So in this case, there's no singleness of heart. There's no love for just the one thing. Wealth riches peripheral stuff choke out that one little plant that's growing among many plants that is focused on kingdom stuff. And ultimately, it's unfruitful. It might be there in the middle of other plants and you might still be able to pick it out if you looked closely, but it's not going to outgrow all of the other things that are growing in this mishmash of uncommitted soil. And as a result, there's no harvest to be drawn from it. It's not going to produce anything. But verse 23, the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop yielding 160 or 30 times what was sown. Dad. So we get this explanation from Jesus and we realize really quickly just thinking about the rest of the book of Matthew that this parable is not happening in a vacuum. We're seeing Jesus talk about these different types of soils in other places. We're seeing examples of people responding like these other types of soil. I think of Matthew 11, 18 through 19 in correspondence with the first type of soil where it's just it's D.O.A. No, it's starting 16. To what can I compare this generation? They're like children sitting in the marketplaces calling out to others. We played a flue for you and you didn't dance. We sang a dirge and you didn't mourn. For John came, neither beating nor drinking. And they say he's a demon. The son of man comes eating and drinking. They say he's a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. But wisdom is proved right by her actions. And then I think of chapter 12 and verse 30 something it's right here. So the Pharisees, they want to sign. The seed is clearly dead on arrival with them. And they're like, oh, we'll do another miraculous sign. And the answer to wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign. But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah, which we broke down in an earlier episode. In addition, you've got the angry rejection of Jesus' forgiveness when he forgives and heals the paralytic. The guy with the withered arm gets healed on the Sabbath. That's the wrong day of the week for healing. They get mad and want to murder him over that stuff. So we've got a huge sample size already through 12 and a half chapters of people being the path type of soil where the seed falls and it's just, I mean, it's over before it starts nothing cooking. And then we get a couple of references to stuff that looks like the shallow soil where the seed seems like it's going to work out, but it just doesn't have any chance against the sun because the shallow isn't soiled, roots can't go deep, it can't produce a harvest or reproduce itself. Again jumping back to Matthew 11 verse 6, blessed is the man who doesn't fall away on account of me. So there's this idea of the one who flirts with it from the squishy middle crowd, but ultimately it doesn't take. And I think of Jesus coming off the sermon on the Mount, hand flipped right to it in Matthew chapter 8. And the crowds are all around and people are all excited about this. And a couple people run up to him and they're like, hey, I'll follow you wherever you go. And Jesus is like, cool, just the heads up. I'm homeless. We get the impression that the guy's like, okay, we certainly don't get an account of him being like, oh, I'm totally in on that. And then another aspiring disciple comes up to Jesus and says, hey, let me go bury my dead father. And as you know, I'm very sympathetic to people liking their fathers given our conversation today, but Jesus tells them, follow me and let the dead bury their own dead. So in both of those examples from that iconic passage, we get a look at what the shallow soil might look like. How in on this are we really how deep are the roots into this? And the third type of soil is the one who does not have singleness of heart. There's a billion things growing up all around him and money and wealth and riches and the allure of all the different things in the world. On this type of soil, the Jesus thing is just one contender among many for the heart of the individual. And obviously, Matthew chapter 19 with the rich young ruler comes to Jesus and is like, I kept the commandments. I'm in. And Jesus is like, cool. You're stuff. Because I know that's the thing that you love most. That's the thorn that's choking you out and it paraphrases mine. And he walks away sad because he's super rich. And then the fourth type of soil, look, I know I'm bragging about my dad, but the fourth type of soil is mom and dad. And with this type of soil, there is a singleness, a focus, a marshaling of all of the resources of life, time, money, relationships, credibility, the mind, all of that in the service of this one objective, this one thing, because in this very unique kind of soil, the roots went deep. And the result of that is that a whole bunch more seeds are produced and those seeds end up in all kinds of places. And probably at about the same ratio, three out of four types of soil are not productive. And one out of four is in the next conversation, I want to talk about what we do with this passage. I think it's a bit of a tricky one in terms of how we internalize it and act it out. So we'll gain that stuff out next time around.
