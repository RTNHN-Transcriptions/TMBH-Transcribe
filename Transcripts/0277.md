 Last time on the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. So it's like tennis. Sometimes you play offensive tennis and sometimes you play defensive tennis and it's like the Pharisees were playing offensive tennis and then Jesus defended it. But then after that, then Jesus is on the offensive and it's a tennis ball real hard at him. And that's how the Bible is. So in the middle of Matthew chapter 12, the tension is ratcheting way up between Jesus and the religious leaders. They just had a couple of Sabbath controversies where they were fighting about whether you can rub grain together in your hands on the Sabbath and whether or not you can heal somebody on the Sabbath. Finally, the religious leaders were like, we're just kept a murdered Jesus. And Jesus was like, oh, I know everybody's thoughts and it's not time for me to get murdered right now. So I'm going to go to a place where you don't get murdered as much. So he strategically withdraws. Matthew then goes on to explain how this is in fulfillment. This and Jesus behavior in general is in fulfillment of the first of the prophetic Isaiah servant songs. And then while Jesus is in this strategic withdrawal place, people are still tracking him down. They bring somebody to Jesus who is demon possessed and that demonic possession manifests in the form of being mute and blind. And then Jesus heals him and everybody's like, whoa, dang, maybe we're wrong about this guy. He's in the Messiah, the son of David. That's a pretty big deal. But then the Pharisees who are still looming around like there's no fully strategically withdrawing from these guys because they have nothing better to do than follow Jesus around the countryside, figuring out what might be another good reason to murder him. And they are like, this is stupid miracle anyway, making somebody who can't talk, talk maybe is a reason he couldn't talk. Guys, a total hack is probably actually casting out demons using the power of demons to do it lame. And then Jesus was like, hey, surprise. I know what you're thinking. If I can make people's arms grow back out of the clear blue sky, I can probably read your dumb thoughts. And I know what your dumb thoughts are. And I'm going to respond to that offensive shot that you just hit thusly. And Jesus points out that it would be absurd for Satan to drive out his own minions. And further, Jesus points out that the Pharisees do exorcisms supposedly. So is it from Satan? Well, you guys do it or is it from God when you guys do it demonstrating that they don't make any sense at all. Jesus transitions to offense. And more or less says, you guys have seen enough stuff both in the ministry of John the Baptist and in what I'm doing here that you know, dang well who this is coming from. You know it's from God. You know it's from the spirit. And just in case we as the reader forget what's going on, remember, Matthew just gave us that little aside from Isaiah 42, that servant song where it says, here's my servant whom I've chosen the one I love and whom I delight. I will put my spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nation. So like Matthew is saying this, Jesus is saying this common sense is saying this even the crowds are starting to say this. And Jesus is like, look, it all lines up for everybody, but you guys and Jesus who the text holds out is knowing the thoughts of everybody is like, yeah, you guys know exactly what you're doing and you are blaspheming the Holy Spirit. You know, you want to say bad stuff about me? Okay. You know, we can work on that. That could be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come. And that's where we left off yesterday. And the Pharisees now verbally are all balled up in the fetal position covering their crotches and they're like, okay, yeah, we get it. That was good. We were just mumbling amongst ourselves. Like you definitely won the point. Okay, I get it. And Jesus is like, yeah, no, I'm not quite done yet. And he keeps going. Verse 33, make a tree good and its fruit will be good or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad for tree is recognized by its fruit. You brood of vipers. How can you who are evil say anything good for out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. But I tell you, the men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they've spoken for by your words, you will be acquitted and by your words, you will be condemned or after breakdown, those last two sentences probably tomorrow because there's just a little bit much to get to. But narratively, it's not tough to see what's going on here. Jesus is going to finish off this point. He's playing all the way through the whistle and it's not hard to understand what he's driving at. Good stuff comes out of good stuff. Bad stuff comes out of bad stuff. So maybe he's anticipating a counter argument here in defense of the Pharisees is like, you know what, these guys say a lot of words. You put a microphone in front of anybody for that long. You catch somebody on a hot mic. Yeah, they're going to say stuff. They're just going to throw things out like maybe you're in league with Satan or stuff, you know, casual stuff like that. So come on, let's be fair. Let's think about all the other good things that they said and not get after them too much for a word or to hear that probably isn't representative of the whole. No, no, no, Jesus, who knows all things and knows of the thoughts of all men and women and knows of the thoughts of these people is coming right back and he's like, when it comes to you guys with your murderous religious attitude, you're like the mud pots in Yellowstone where the stench of the sulfur and the death that is way down below in the bowels of the earth gets belched and farted up to the surface of those disgusting gurgling mud pots and there's just no keeping it down. There's this giant reservoir of basically earth fart that lives in the middle of the planet and it can't help but belch to the surface. For tourists to smell and you know when you look at that, you're never like, oh, I bet there's a bunch of really good smelling stuff down at the bottom of that pot too. We just happened to catch one of those real eggy farty sulfur type burps. No, you just know there's a big reservoir of gross down there and a little bit of it occasionally boils to the surface. You get the principle. Jesus gets the principle. Everybody who is being criticized by Jesus gets the principle. You are a bad tree. You are producing murderous, ugly, self-righteous, prideful, bad fruit. And then Jesus goes on to borrow language from John the Baptist that was spoken of with that chapter three. I don't remember which verse. I'm going to find it as we go. But Jesus quote, flipping back over here is, you brood of vipers. How can you who are evil say anything good? Matthew three, John uses that exact phrase, right? Here it is. Matthew three, but when he John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming wrath, produce fruit in keeping with repentance. Dang. Jesus is deeply identifying with John the Baptist with that language. He knows what he's doing. That tell off that happened in Matthew chapter three from John the Baptist to the Pharisees and Sadducees. Everybody heard about that. It's like the thing that happened in the lunchroom that one time when you were in school, like by the next period, everybody knew about the thing that happened in the lunchroom. That kind of word spreads quickly. This was a very dramatic thing. We read it all casually. Like, Oh, John told them off. Those guys must have been feeling really stupid. No, this was a critique that was a threat that was a tremor that shook the entire order of how everybody thought about what was right and wrong and who's in charge around here and what is true religion look like. We knew John the Baptist called these guys Brute of Vipers by the time we get to Matthew chapter 12. And John was probably pretty famous for it. And there were probably a few bugs placed in the ear of Herod to do something about this John who would say such a brash thing by the Pharisees and the Sadducees. But look what John goes on to say. Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. Jesus not only draws on John's language about the Brute of Vipers is disgusting, slimy, musky ball of snakes that make that gloppy mouth sound as they roll around in a giant snake clawed in some den under your porch. You can picture it. That's what they sound like. If you want to, you can also imagine that sound when you picture the mud pots from Yellowstone. I won't make the sound twice, but it applies in both places. That's just good writing and efficient use of time on my part as a host. You're welcome. So Jesus not only references back to John the Baptist, disgusting Brute of Vipers illustration, but he also references back to this produced fruit that is in keeping with repentance. Good tree, good fruit, bad tree, bad fruit. For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks from the reservoir in the gas pocket in the bowels of the earth, belches forth the same scent from the Yellowstone mud pot. And you know what? I'm going to break that down more on the what do we do with that personally thing tomorrow. But let's just round out Jesus flow of thought for now. The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. When Jesus illustrates the same point with two or three different analogies in a row, you get the impression he might really, really mean it. And you might be looking at this passage with me here today and be like, yeah, dang, he used two different illustrations right there. But really he already used a third illustration there as well all the way back in Matthew 622 in the Sermon on the Mount when he's talking about not storing up for yourself treasures on earth where moth and rust destroyed, but store up treasures in heaven. Remember how that goes next verse 22 then says, the eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness? And if you'll recall, lamp there is being used more like sunroof or skylight, not so much like a little lamp or lantern that you carry around. It's like what is being passed through this window in and to the soul. If there's a yuck in the one place, there's going to be yuck in the other place. So it's linguistically pretty fascinating that we've got two arcs from earlier in the gospel of Matthew that have been lobbed forward here and are both converging on this particular passage, that being John the Baptist language about the brood of vipers and fruit keeping with repentance and Jesus language about what is going on in the soul and what is allowed into it and what therefore comes out of it. In other words, this document is not haphazard slop. This is very carefully thought through edited, organized, efficient material. And there's a reason that whether you think there's a God or not, Matthew has stood the test of time. This is absolutely brilliant, efficacious, forceful writing that merits multiple passes to understand all of the levels that are here, really for any type of audience member, the theist, the atheist, anything in between. So in summary, Jesus is looking at these guys and he's like, no, it's not just a passing word. No, it's not just an off day. Nope, it's not just a thanks. We caught you on a hot mic. This is who you are. These things you are saying, this rejection of the work of God while simultaneously proclaiming how dedicated to God you are, this is the reality of you. And here we are in the middle of a response to Jesus being accused of being in league with Beelzebub, the Lord of flies. And Jesus is using imagery that talks about what is deep down within you, good or bad, can't help it come out. That also probably would have rung a bell with the original audience who had this notion of Beelzebub being one who could dispatch the flies of pestilence and death from deep within his belly out his mouth and into the world to do damage. This is brilliant. Writing on the part of Matthew, this is brilliant rhetoric on the part of Jesus. This is brilliant audience awareness on the part of both. And it's utterly publicly humiliating for the Pharisees and Sadducees who all the more now really only have one play left. And that's we got to kill this guy. I love that we hang out together every day and we get to do this stuff. I cannot thank you enough in your very full, very rich, very robust lives that you choose to take a few minutes to do this with me. That is humbling, that is cool. Thank you for gaming it out. Even at the times where you look at it and you're like, nah, he's reading the whole thing wrong where you see it different. That is awesome of you that you're the kind of person who doesn't need me or anybody else to think all the exact same things to the finest detail about everything in order to call each other friends. I just like the way you come at it. I appreciate that you're here. Thanks for doing this with me. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do it again soon.
