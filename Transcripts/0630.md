 to to remember like the last couple days and I was sick and sound terrible me too. That was a hard time for us. But we got through it and I feel a lot better and my voice is better. And we could have just taken a couple days off. Like I think we could do that probably right. But I don't like to. We get a streak going. We've been doing this together for ever like two and a half years every single weekday. I'm not taking a day off. I just gutted it out. So I understand it was pretty low energy there and it was funny. Like the last two days I was grinding to make that happen. I was all medicated up and tired on all this flu stuff and everything. But I just really really wanted to keep working on it. So thank you for taking me as I am at any given time. And I am glad to be feeling better and hanging out with you because it's a privilege. And I do not take it for granted that you lend me any chunk of time out of the tons of important things you have to do every day. The fact that you would make this one little part of it is a huge honor. Matthew 26 leads us to so many interesting historical questions in order to understand the finer points of what's going on with the home stretch of the story. Jesus rest trial, crucifixion, resurrection, all of that business. And in verse 2 of Matthew 26 he says, as you know, the Passover is two days away and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified. Yesterday we spent some time talking about the Passover, what that would have meant culturally, even just logistically in Jerusalem. That week was nuts. And further we talked a little bit about what it would mean spiritually to the original audience. But now verses 3 and 4 take us into another historical question we have to think about to get what's going on. And that goes like this, then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the name of the high priest whose name was Caiaphas and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him. All right. It is really easy for us as we go through the book of Matthew because we're foreigners to this conversation to start lumping together all of these religious characters, Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes, the chief priests, the elders, all of that stuff, but they're not really the same thing. Now we've discussed that some length, the differences between the Pharisees and the Sadducees and, I don't know, there's like a whole episode named after that or two episodes. You know, just scroll through the several hundred that came before this. You'll find it should be absolutely no problem. But when we're talking about the chief priest and the elders, we're talking about a little different tribe and to be specific, we're talking about a little more important tribe. These are the people who are at the center of the decision making. These are the people who are present in the Sanhedrin and most influential in that environment. And these are the people who are the pool of candidates from which the high priests are drawn. For the most part, what we're seeing in terms of the big opposition from the Pharisees and Sadducees throughout the book of Matthew and since we've been in Jerusalem here for Passion Week starting in chapter 21, what we're seeing mostly are professional religious types who wield significant influence, but not the all-stars. We're not seeing the elites except for at the end of chapter 21 where the chief priests are milling around and they figure out that Jesus parable about the landowner who sends his son and then the tenants at the vineyard kill the landowner's son. The chief priests figured out, he's talking about us and they got real mad and they decided right then and there that yeah, we definitely need to kill him. That's what the end of 21 says. So for the most part though, these elite leaders have been hanging out in the background and the original audience would have known that we're dealing with significant characters opposing Jesus, but what's it going to be like when Jesus runs into the decision makers, the ones who are at the top of the food chain, the all-stars, the high salary types, the ones who are directly appointed by the political rulers of this era and therefore have access and partnership to political power. No doubt the original audience understood that the stakes would be raised and the exchange would be different. To this point, the elite level of leadership have not so lead themselves with this apparent messianic candidate. It's beneath them, but the fact that Jesus is now in Jerusalem, that none of their underlings can handle him and that the people seem to be pretty crazy about Jesus means that all of a sudden the religious elites, the top dogs are going to come into play and they're going to have to either go along with Jesus and tell the people that, hey, we're the high priest. We're the ones who are the intermediaries between God and man and we have sized this guy up and yep, he's the Messiah. He's the one who's predicted. They're either going to have to do that or they're going to have to get rid of him. And I don't know how you get rid of somebody like this other than through assassination or state sanctioned assassination, state sanctioned murder. So again, I would stress that the people who are reading this and living this out for the first time, they would have understood this political power dynamic and that all the interactions with the underlings could only take the story so far that eventually this would go to so to speak the Supreme Court and the attentive audience member would have understood that how the Supreme Court ruled on this was going to change the course of the history of their people. So much was at stake. Well, that leaves a few questions for us though. Most notably, who is this Caiaphas guy? What is his title? What is a high priest? How does one become a high priest? Where does that come from in the Bible? How would people have thought about this role specifically? And why is he allowed to just plot assassinations and executions? And in order to sort out that question, we're going to have to do deep dive all the way back into the archives of the Old Testament and look at how this role evolved because it wasn't just one thing. High priest meant something different at about four different stages of history. And it's not even like we can really look at the high priest thing now and say, well, how is it now? Because effectively high priest, as we understand it here, was going to end in 70 A.D. just a few decades later when the entire sacrificial system and all of this great reckoning that it looks like Jesus might have been eluding to in chapters 24 and 25 started to go down. So we'll have a lot to unpack there. I'm going to take a whole episode on that quickly. I found a thing that I think you might like. And I don't talk about things that I think you might like very often. This is not a sponsorship. These are some people I've met in my internet travels, but they have a good idea and they're doing a thing that I think might make your life better. So I want to point you toward it. It's called the pour over and you can find it at the pour over.org. The dudes who I've met who are working on this, they just had an idea to say, like, what if we did a news thing that wasn't overwhelming and exhausting, that wasn't decidedly conservative or decidedly liberal, but just tried to look at the news that everybody is looking at all the time anyway. And just sprinkle in some basic little reminders of like, yeah, you know, here's the big picture. The kingdom values. Here's a big picture of kind of just, you know, what the Bible says about the nature of life and existence. And it is, it's the weirdest, coolest email that I get right now. And it's pretty quick. It's a fast read. And then what happens though is, like I see the news stories that I see angrily on Twitter, but without anger, just a quick helpful summary. And then there's some kind of very quick reflection right after that. And there's just not much else going on right now in terms of media in my life, where I see basic accurate information about important things happening on planet Earth. And then literally right next to it, I see simple basic reminders of kingdom values. It's a really smart thing. It's a very simple thing. It's free. It's easy to sign up. It's the poor over dot org. Did I get that right before? Yeah, the poor over dot org. This is just an email. It just comes into your inbox. I think you'll appreciate it. That's why I'm telling you about it. I think these guys are cool and smart and they're on to something and this might be something you'd enjoy. This episode is not brought to you by the poor over, but I hope you'll check it out. I think you'll dig it. All right, more on Kiafis and the role of the High Priest next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
