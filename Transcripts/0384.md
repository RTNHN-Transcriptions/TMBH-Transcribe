 What's up, my friends? I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and we have things to discuss. Do you have a mountain or a bluff or some kind of high up place that you like to drive to or hike to when you need perspective and to get away from it all and see the world a little bit differently? I understand that some of you live in flat places, and that's probably not an option. I used to live in a place called Grand Island, Nebraska, and the only topography in the whole place was called Tornado Hill, and it was called such because on the night of something, something 1980, something there were like five gigantic tornadoes that wrecked most of the town and inspired some movie called Night of the Twisters. And then when they cleaned up, they took all the junk and they put it in a big pile in this park and just put dirt over the top of it. It's like the only place where you can sled or do anything, but there's like little bits of refrigerator and barbed wire and rebar sticking out of there every now and then. So, it's maximum safety there at Tornado Hill, but even in Grand Island, Nebraska, where there is no topography, I would find myself wanting to go and stand on top of Tornado Hill from time to time and just think about the world, see things a little differently. Well, I am not alone in thinking that that is a good way to spend your time, that it's good for clearing the noggin and processing life a little differently. Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ, the Messiah, if we are to believe Peter's identification of him in Matthew chapter 16, he also found value in going up to places that had higher elevation where you could get some perspective and take in the world. We see him do so once at the behest of Lucifer. So, I guess maybe that's not the best example ever. But the next time he goes up on a mountain, it's to teach all of his disciples, and that's a sermon on the mountain. So, that's a pretty good trip up a mountain. And then another time, after he's sad about a horrible family tragedy happening, he finally manages to get away and he goes up onto some high place and prays to his father and then that gets interrupted because he sees his buddies in some kind of mortal peril, having a nautical incident out on the Sea of Galilee, so he has to bail on that and go solve it. But then we get to Matthew chapter end of 16, beginning of 17, and we get yet another one of these go up on the mountain for something very transcendent to unfold kind of events. And this is maybe the big one, right? Because what we're looking at is an event that gets called the Transfiguration. And we get parallel accounts of this event in Matthew, Mark, and Luke that help us piece together where this is going down and what it meant. And so just quickly reset. What we have going on here is Jesus has an ugly run in with the religious leaders at the beginning of chapter 16. And all the run ins are ugly run ins at this time. As guys are just mad about everything, and they want to kill him and get rid of him. They're looking for any reason to do so. And Jesus wins all the arguments, but it doesn't matter. They have the sword or access to the people with the sword. So they're probably going to win on this thing eventually. It feels like we're on borrowed time as the narrative is unfolding. So Jesus gets out of there goes up north with his disciples to Caesarea Philippi, which is way up north way far away from the influence of the religious leaders and his enemies. And there it's like, hey, we got a little pow out here. I picture there being a campfire scene where Jesus is sitting with his disciples and he's like, I, we got to get to a place before I get killed by these clowns back down south, where my disciples understand who I actually am. There's no way they can represent me and do the things that they're going to be commissioned to do next when I'm gone. If they don't understand who I actually am. And so he starts probing about that. Peter, as we've discussed, says, well, I know who you are. You're the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God. And Jesus is like, yeah, Roger, that's exactly who I am. And then Jesus says to the disciples, according to Matthew 1624, all of this stuff about, hey, if you want to come after me, you have to pick up your cross and follow me. And he gives these three reasons for why that makes sense, even though in world terms, like intentionally picking up a cross, which is an instrument of painful, miserable, bloody, asphyxiating execution. I mean, you wouldn't want to do that usually because of the execution component of said cross. But Jesus makes his threefold case for why no, in light of kingdom values, this actually makes sense. And then at the end of that, he says, I tell you the truth, some of you are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. Now the chapter breaks and the verse breaks are all after the fact. I mean, they're real, but Christians don't believe they're inspired. Sometimes they work for you when you're reading the Bible because it helps you organize thoughts and track with the organizational patterns that seem to be apparent from the original authors. But other times they get in the way, because they interrupt the flow of thought, you might not make the connection between something that happens on either side of a chapter break. So it looks like if you just take the chapter break away, and I don't know why I'm doing that with my hand, it won't work, because in my Bible, the words are printed with ink on paper, but I'm still going to paw at it incessantly to make this point. If you take that chapter break away, you just roll right from Jesus saying some of you are going to see the Son of man that's me in glory in the kingdom. And then the very next thing is the narrative says 17 one after six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James and John, the brother of James and led them up to a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun and his clothes became as wide as the light just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus. That stuff, as we get into actually what happened in this crazy, difficult to imagine sequence that we're going to impact tomorrow. But for now, let's back it up to the timeline here and just make sure we're still tracking with the narrative, because we've been around a campfire for like two weeks. So narratively, we are still way up north near Caesarea Philippi. Now in Matthew, it says, after six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James and John, and we flip over to Mark chapters eight and nine. Yes, I had to look that up in advance because I had no idea where it was. Maybe I still don't know where it is. Yeah, here it is. Beginning at nine, we get the same kind of account. Peter's confession of Christ happens toward the end of eight. Then nine, one, Mark has Jesus saying the same thing about there's some here who aren't going to taste death until they see the kingdom of God come with power. And then nine, two in Mark, it says, after six days, Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up to a high mountain where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. So six days, the timeline matches up between Mark and Matthew and high mountain. That high mountain is ambiguous. But let's see if we get more clues over here in Luke, which I believe is also chapter nine. Should have written down the verse, but I did it. So I'm going to sing the song that I sing when I'm looking for stuff, but I don't know where it is. Here it is. Okay. So same kind of thing. Jesus has an engagement with the disciples. Peter confesses Christ that starts in verse 18, apparently. And then he starts to warn the disciples that he's going to get killed and raise back to life. Says the same stuff about take up your cross and follow me. And then verse 28 says about eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. Same thing goes down there. The only thing that stands out is that eight days versus six days thing. But I think that isn't too tough to account for one, both Matthew and Mark say after six days, that would mean maybe after the completion of six days or after parts of a total of six days, the Jewish rendering of time is a little bit different in terms of how you count a weekend or a few days. But this is not irreconcilable with Luke who would be using a Greek or Roman, whatever you want to call it, a Gentile rendering of days. And he doesn't even say specifically, it was six days saying about eight days, even if you know exactly what the days were on the calendar would be a quick way with one word to acknowledge. Yeah, people render days differently. This gets you in the ballpark of the timeframe. But the day count is important between the three, not just because we always want to try to reconcile accounts and look at questions about the reliability of this thing, but also because it gives us some clues as to what this cool overlook place was that Jesus had in mind to take his disciples for this really cool event. Now, historically, if you go to Israel and dig around, you will find that the mountain that is associated with the transfiguration, that is these events we're starting to look at just now, is quite a ways south and west of the Sea of Galilee. And it's called Mount Tabor. Mount Tabor is weird. It's like a gumdrop looking mountain. It just sticks up out of nowhere. You can Google it, you're smart, you can find that stuff. And there's a whole church and everything up on the top, the church of the transfiguration. And it's a place has been a pilgrimage site for ever and ever associated with the transfiguration. All of that said, if the low end of the amount of time Jesus and the disciples had between being at Caesarea Philippi and getting to the transfiguration is six days, and the high end is a total of eight days, that would have been a massive hall for them to get from way up north of the Sea of Galilee all the way down to south and west of the Sea of Galilee that quickly. It would have been a very odd out of the way walk. And this is one of those places where I feel like the clumsy tradition and limited access and imagination of early crusaders might interfere with the historical accuracy of traditions regarding where certain things happened in the Holy Land. And there is traditional support dating all the way back to like the 200s, maybe 300s for Mount Tabor is being the location of this thing. Origin. And then Jerome, I don't think Jerome was ever actually there. Maybe went on a trip or something that I don't remember. But Cyprian maybe as well. It was the other guy who said that. I'm looking it up right now. No, it was Cyril of Jerusalem, not Cyprian who also thought that the amount of transfiguration was at Mount Tabor. Geography on the other hand points us to a more credible answer. And that is Mount Herman, which is a much more dramatic, high place, high mountain. And Caesarea Philippi sits more or less at the foot of this place. Elevation starts going up as you go north. So it makes a lot more sense logistically that we are even further up north right now and further away from the heart of Jesus opposition. Why does this matter? Well, I can think of three reasons. One, it's fun. Two, why wouldn't you want to know something if you can think it through and try to know it? Isn't that better than not knowing it and not thinking about it? And three, as well on pack in the next couple of episodes, I do think that there is some significance to be read into this if it happens way way up north far away from all of the heat and controversy. And I think it reads a tiny bit differently if it happens down south of the Sea of Galilee and closer to Jerusalem in a place where Jesus really is only hung out a little bit during his formal ministry time as the stakes have been raised. All right, we're going to get into more trying to figure out what the heck a transfiguration is and what actually happened here next time around. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
