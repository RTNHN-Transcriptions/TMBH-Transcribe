 Hey there, I'm Jeff and this is the 10-Minute Bible Hour Podcast. You know those episodes that are like double episodes? Well, that's what we're getting today as Matt recaps the book of Matthew up to the point where we are now. Enjoy. What's up, my friends? I'm Matt. This is the 10-Minute Bible Hour Podcast and today's going to be a super fun day, whether you are brand new at this thing. First time here, if so, welcome, by the way. Or if you've been with me since the very beginning, because what we need to do to set up the next chunk of Bible that we're going to be looking at, which is the very end of Matthew chapter 13, is reset this thing a little bit. So if you've been here for a while and you're starting to get to the place where like, oh, so much Bible, when we were only like four chapters in, it was easy to keep it all straight in my head. But now it's getting overwhelming, have no fear. We're going to frame it all up again today. If you are here for the first time and you're like, dang, I'm looking back and like, my mom told me this podcast was good and I should probably listen, but there's like 330 episodes already and I don't know if I want to go and listen to all of those. I feel yeah. I would be feeling the exact same way. The cool thing is this is just a great pick it up, reset point. And again, it's all in the service of framing up the passage we are going to be looking at probably at the end of this episode and on into tomorrow's. In light of that, the book of Matthew is written by, well, Matthew, the tax collector. He gets a brief little cameo here in the document when he runs into Jesus and Jesus is like, hey, you should quit your dumb job and come follow me instead. Matthew's like, I'll probably do that. And then he does. And along the way, he's apparently diligently writing down the things he saw and the stuff that happens earlier in the book of Matthew is apparently the result of Matthew's talking with his buddies who also follow Jesus, gathering that data, filling it in. So we're getting overwhelmingly a firsthand account, not just of Jesus words and actions, but we're also getting a firsthand account of how people felt about it. And I think that's where the really fascinating social dynamic lies here, whether you're a person of faith or a person who's just really curious about things of faith and history and people in humanity. Either way, it's really intriguing to see the way these political, social, religious frictions worked themselves out. And it's also very familiar because the people in these stories are acting like us. They're acting like the people you know now. So the opening chunk of Matthew starts with a great, big, ambitious swing. Matthew's trying to make the point that Jesus is the long, promised king that his people, the Jewish people had been anticipating. And he's using pretty inside baseball language here in the early going. This probably wouldn't have resonated super well with people outside of Judaism, outside of Israel, Judea, Galilee, this neck of the woods. But for people who were in it, I mean, this was his common goal. His common place is any quick passing cultural reference that you know you could drop with literally anybody you meet on the street in the place where you live, and they're going to totally resonate with it. Matthew's writing to a group of people and Jesus showed up in the midst of a group of people who are a part of this long story that dates back to as far back as any of them can remember or any books remember, where God initiates existence, then existence and humanity falls and corruption enters in. And then gradually God goes about this redemptive process that includes creating a family, an ethnic people group to himself so that he can model who he is and how he interacts with stuff to the larger world. And the whole idea is that this people group, who are all descendants of the Old Testament character Abraham, are going to somehow be a blessing to, they're going to show the stuff of God to the people of the world. And then eventually Moses comes along sometime later and God makes a deal with Moses still with the same people group to say, I'm going to be your God and you're going to be my people. And if you obey me, I'm going to bless you and everybody's going to know that I'm the one true God. And if you disobey me, I'm going to correct you and everybody's going to know that I'm the one true God. And then a few hundred years later, now they're set up, they've got a little kingdom and everything going and God makes a promise to David and the promise is there is going to be an eternal throne, whether you turn out to be a good, great super guy or not, one way or another, your descendants are going to sit on this eternal throne. And there's going to be this great king who will come and all of this redemptive work of God is going to be completed in the work of this king who will sit on your throne, the throne of David forever. Well, and after that though, things get really bad and their country falls apart and they have a little civil war and they end up split into two countries and then a serious and big monster empire comes in and conquers them and that's disappointing. And then Babylon comes in and conquers the other half of them and that's also disappointing. And you get like 400 years of things not really going great and then the Greeks come and conquer them after they try to make a new country for a little while. And then they have to overthrow the Greeks for a few decades, but then along come the Romans and they're like, now we want to be in charge. And so by the time Jesus shows up and Matthew is writing, these are people who've been kicked around and they have these vague recollections of there being a God who gives a rip about them and then having some unique standing or role as ethnic children of God and there's this king promised thing, Messiah, whatever. I don't know, but they've shifted gears and now they're more worried about like political solutions to the Roman problem. God is just too far in the rear view mirror. Well, enter Matthew chapter one, which starts with of all things, a genealogy. You and I wouldn't care about that, but to the original audience, all the names in this genealogy going all the way back to Abraham would have born with them in the minds of the people, a story that would have communicated all kinds of layers of theological truth and reminded them of all of the things that God did with their ancestors and reminded them of the promises about David. And so you get to the end of that genealogy and people would have been like, okay, I'm listening. Yes, I remember this. It'd be cool if that were a thing. And then Matthew rolls on to talk about the birth and the early life of Jesus and what God did in the lives of his parents. And all of this birth prologue of chapter one is to say, look, he's King Lee. Jesus ticks all the right boxes to be the long awaited king. Keep an eye on this guy. In chapter two, we get the stuff about Herod being weird, but also some Gentiles, some non-Jewish people who theoretically shouldn't get or care about any of this. They noticed this star and they connected odds that this baby that's born is from God and they travel a really long way to find out more about that. And here it's like, maybe I'll just kill all those babies because I don't really want some rival spiritual leader rising up. And so Mary and Joseph and little baby Jesus end up in Egypt for a while until Herod dies. Then some time passes Jesus grows up. People see him being a kid going through puberty, having acne, probably going through that awkward fumbling phase where he's not great at carpentry. And you get this weird invisible theological moment between the end of chapter two and the beginning of chapter three, where you have to look at the bigger picture and you're like, well, did he have acne? Did he have to learn and struggle to become a carpenter? Did he always know everything or if as we learn over in the gospel of Luke that Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and favor with God and men, we're in this interim time. He's living a somewhat normal life. There's some highlights in there that were apparently pretty amazing as well, but that by the time we get into chapter three and he goes out to meet his cousin, John the Baptist, and to be baptized, it's becoming evident that this isn't just some local kid who's starting to come into his own, but rather this is the promised one of God, the Messiah, the king. And finally, that was going to be confusing for the people who watched him grow up and we'll talk about that more in a minute. John the Baptist confronts everybody. He's his wild radical and people are mad and confused, but also compelled by what he has to say. He calls people to turn from this weird pseudo-theistic sort of political atheistic view of the world and to repent and follow God. Then Jesus shows up and John's like, whoa, dang, that's the guy. That's the one. And he baptizes Jesus and the whole Trinity shows up. The Father, the Spirit lands on him like a dove. And God the Father says, this is my son who my love with him, I am well pleased. And then he goes straight from there out into the desert to get tempted by Satan himself. And you know, as 40 days of starvation goes, I think Jesus fares really, really well. He fends off all of the physical, spiritual power temptations that Satan throws at him. And in doing so in Matthew 4, Jesus passes a test that literally everybody else ever has failed. Sin beat everybody in the Bible except for Jesus. He can hack it. So all the more so, well, I guess he's the king. I mean, I guess he's positioned to do something about the human problem because he wasn't defeated by the human problem, like everybody else was. He goes and he rounds up a group of guys that follow him around and they don't exactly get what's going on yet. But by the end of chapter four, he's getting a following, miraculous things are happening. He's teaching, but we don't know the specifics of that teaching yet until Matthew chapter five, the book of Matthew is structured around five big speeches of Jesus, the first of which is the Sermon on the Mount, which starts in Matthew five and it opens with the Beatitudes. Blessed are these people, blessed are those people. And all of these statements of blessing are a description of the upside down values of Jesus kingdom. Remember he's a king. He's coming to establish the kingdom that was promised to David like a thousand years before any of this stuff starts going down. So it makes sense that he would use this Kingly language. It would make sense that he would talk about a kingdom. It would make sense that he would articulate what that kingdom is going to look like. And it would also make sense that he would hold that kingdom out in contrast to the ground rules of the normal world that everybody's used to. So the Sermon on the Mount is an overt articulation of all of these values, loving your enemy, the loving God with your heart, valuing things that are eternal more than valuing the things of the world, not worrying, deferring the habit of judgment to God who's qualified to judge and you're not. And it wraps up with a warning. This is real. This is true. The truest realist thing is the kingdom. This is where you want to be. The world kingdom has a destination to it as well, but there's not life at the end of it. So we get to the end of this great big speech and everybody's like, wow, he is different than all of our public speakers and religious leaders. The synagogue, he teaches as one who actually has the authority to say this. But the implicit question at the end of chapter seven is nice words, but can you back it up? Do you actually have that authority? And so in chapters eight and nine, what we get is the answer, which is a resounding yes. Now, as we get into eight and nine, people are starting to wonder who exactly are you? It's like nobody wants to bring themselves to a place where they say, are you the king? Is too risky. We got another eight chapters before somebody really takes a swipe at that. The only entity that's willing to just say, you're the son of God in Matthew chapters eight and nine or some demons that he's casting out, but all these miracles happen over nature, over distance, over disease, over death, over demons, over sin. Even Jesus even forgives a guy before he even heals him. This guy with busted up legs and Jesus is like, take heart, son, your sins are forgiven. And everybody gets mad about that in chapter nine. Well, the religious leaders do at least. So I was blaspheme only the son of God could forgive something like that. And I imagine Jesus is kind of looking at them like, yeah. So it seems like you guys are doing the math. So he heals that guy. He heals some blind people. He heals somebody who can't talk. And in those closing miracles of chapter nine, we started to get this language introduced about having eyes to see and ears to hear. And the idea is the religious leaders who are mad about Jesus doing this redemptive stuff and healing people, they don't have eyes to see. Their eyes are slammed shut. And the other people, the unimpressive people, people you wouldn't expect to be the ones to get it, their eyes are opened. Attention is starting to ratchet up at this point. And that's exactly when we get the second of five big speeches around which this whole thing is built. And that's the missional discourse of chapter 10. It's a fancy title that some theology person added after the fact missional discourse isn't in the Bible. But the speeches and the speeches directed at the disciples. And it's basically, hey guys, I'm going to send you out into this great big open world. This is no longer going to be a side scrolling, super Mario Brothers style game where you can only go one direction and you can't backtrack if you scroll the screen. No, it's going to be more like Zelda or Skyrim. You get to go out into the great wide world and explore all of these different things and interact with all of these different characters. And you don't really need to take a bunch of stuff with you. Just go out with this message about the kingdom of heaven being near and do kingdomish things along with that message. That's simple. So he tells him this is what it's going to look like to go out and do it. It's going to be difficult at times. Some people aren't going to like this message very much, but be shrewd and be innocent as you do it. And then he goes on to say, hey, in the medium term, this is what it's going to look like. Also very difficult because some people aren't going to like the message of the kingdom. And then he goes on to tell his disciples before he sends him out that in the long term, it's going to be really difficult as well that there's going to be beautiful, redemptive stuff happening with all of this kingdom business, but that it's also going to be painful at times. And that does turn out to be the experience that the disciples go on to have, not necessarily just on this little trip that happens between chapters 10 and 11, but in general, this seems to be the experience that they have with the rest of their lives because they decided to follow Jesus and be ambassadors and representatives of this kingdom and the values of the kingdom and the king who's behind it all. Well, then we get into chapter 11, the disciples come back from their open world quest. We don't really learn a ton about how everything went down, but John the Baptist, the guy all the way back from chapter three who baptized Jesus was Jesus' cousin. He's in prison. Things went afoul politically. He said the wrong stuff. He got canceled and censored and it was an ugly time politically. And he sends some of his followers to ask Jesus, like, are you the one? Was there going to be like a revolution or something? I don't know if this is exactly what we were expecting. And Jesus barely patiently says, you go back and tell John what you see. And the blind receive sight, the lame walk, those have leprosy or cured, the deaf hear, the dead are coming back to life. Good news is preached to the poor. And so the idea is like, we'll go back and look at your Old Testament scriptures. What is it supposed to look like when the Messiah shows up? It's like that exact list. All the things I'm doing are the exact list. So John's followers go back to tell John that stuff and a bunch of other people are standing around and I almost suspect they're kind of feeling smug about how much they know and how much they didn't ask a dumb question. And then Jesus turns on them a little bit and pushes back on that self satisfaction about their own knowledge. This is again in keeping with that idea of God opening the eyes of some to really see this, but also the eyes of some being shut. And so Jesus pushes back really harshly on the zeitgeist, the spirit of the moment, the political social mentality that people have, their weird understandings of truth and privilege and wealth and power and politics and how religion fits into all of that stuff. And ultimately Jesus condemns it all is like, this stuff is a heavy burden, but come to me, all you who are weary and burdened and I'll give you rest. He says, because he's gentle and humble and his yoke is easy and his burden is light. So as hard as he pushes back on the room. He also follows that with gentleness. Then we get into chapter 12 and now the tension is getting through the roof. The religious leaders just can't stand anymore. This Jesus stuff, like your little speech thing was nice, your little genealogy thing. That's great. I mean, we heard the baptism thing was really cool. Still don't have an explanation for that. But it just doesn't seem like you're on board with our religious game plan here. We don't like where you're steering this whole thing. And so they get mad about Jesus healing somebody on the Sabbath. They get mad about Jesus disciples eating some little bits of grain in a field on the Sabbath. And in response to that, Jesus firmly turns his attention and his criticism back toward them, effectively saying that there's not life in what you all are teaching and what you all are doing and reiterating once again that there is life in who he is and what he's doing. Then remember we put a pin in the whole invisible years of Jesus growing up between chapter two and chapter three. Well, that's important for the end of chapter 12 here because then Jesus family is like, I don't know. There's so much pressure here. People feel weird about this. Jesus middle school gym teacher is like, he only did four pushups and he couldn't even climb the rope. I'm not sure he's actually the son of God or the Messiah. I don't know. And he came and talked to me at the coffee shop. And now I'm going to, I'm going to grab the brothers and sisters. So now it looks like Mary and maybe Jesus brothers and sisters are feeling some social pressure in their hometown and regionally. And they know Jesus is getting himself into trouble. And so they go and they sit outside of a talk he's giving and they're like, say, send somebody in and be like, Hey, get Jesus to come out here and talk to us. And Jesus doesn't. He's like, who's my mother? Who are my brothers? And then he points at the people who are listening to him and taking it seriously. And he's like, these people are my brothers for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother. So in that moment, Jesus isn't rejecting his family. What he's doing is affirming that he's building a new family of faith and that anyone who lays eyes on these words is invited. It's pretty exciting. Then we get into what we've been working on lately. And that is chapter 13, that same day that he has this weird interaction with his family. He's like, I'm just going to go getting a boat. And so he does. He goes and gets in a boat. And there's a whole crowd there. And so he teaches to the crowd from the boat. And that's where we get the third of the five great teachings of Jesus around which the gospel of Matthew is structured. Sometimes we call this the kingdom parable discourse. And in it, he teaches a parable about a sewer who scattered a bunch of seeds and some of it worked out and some of it didn't. He teaches a parable about a guy who planted good seeds in a field that somebody came and planted similar looking bad seeds in the field. He tells a couple of micro parables about this little mustard seed that gets big, this yeast that works through the whole dough. Then he gets off the boat and he goes inside with the disciples and they're like, what did that one mean about the field with the wheat and the other seeds? And he explains all of that stuff. He's got a couple more micro parables that are just for the disciples talking about a treasure in a field that somebody discovers and takes all his money and buys the field so he can have the treasure. Talks about this amazing pearl that somebody finds in a marketplace. Then he talks about this dragnet that gets a gigantic haul of all kinds of different things, different fish in the net. And then in the story, the fishermen go to shore and naturally they sort out the fish that are good and edible from the fish that aren't edible. And then finally he looks at the disciples and he's like, all right, eyes to see, ears to hear. Do you guys get all that? We did. And he's like, great. Therefore, every teacher of the law who's been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old affirming to them that Jesus is fulfilling and completing and drawing on all of the old stuff that God has done while also at the same time doing the next thing that God is doing that was always the plan all along, indicating that his disciples and anybody who has ears to hear eyes to see and is tracking with this stuff is going to have new responsibilities and a new role in this new family of faith that he is building. And speaking of new families, hey, look at that. Those of you who are brand new here, those you've been here for a while, we're all cut up. We're all on the same page together and we are all positioned well to understand how this next little passage at the end of Matthew 13 works tomorrow. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
