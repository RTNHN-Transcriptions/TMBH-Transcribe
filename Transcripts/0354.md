 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And for the last few episodes, we've been doing this kind of odd pre-music intro, but that's just me resetting the stage so that we're all on the same page. We're breaking down Matthew chapter 15 verses 21 through 28, which I am coming to see as effectively the mid-season finale of the Gospel of Matthew. It seems like Jesus and Matthew are drawing us to a place where we take a little pause and size up everything we've done in the first half of this book and size up where we're at with the conversation with the example of the Canaanite woman right in front of us. So we started out on a quest to figure out what's going on with Jesus and why he seems harsh here. We're still working on that, but I'm sure you're also feeling this too, that the conversation is taking us beyond this question of, hey, what the heck is going on here? And into a larger question of, hey, what the heck just went on with those first 15 chapters, the first half of the book, and what do I make of the stuff that has been put in front of me by Matthew? Let's go unpack more of that right now after some music. And then Jesus says the thing, yeah, it's not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs. Is he saying that because that's what he means? Because he thinks the entire redemptive plan of its father is wrong. It looks, somebody might look at the Bible in Jesus and say, it's interesting. I don't know, I'm not convinced. I don't think I'm going to follow Jesus or anything, but I like the book and he's an interesting character. Okay, that's cool. But I think it's very hard to carefully read the book of Matthew and imagine that he just has this one line that's a total departure. I mean, if you're kind of allowed, even if the book of Matthew is a complete fraud, you'd still have to acknowledge it's very obvious that whoever wrote the book of Matthew is making Jesus look good. He likes Jesus. He wants people to come away thinking positive things about Jesus. It would be such an odd departure then for him to just have a throwaway line right here where Jesus looks like a chump. I think what we might be getting instead is a line that would have been very familiar to the original audience, just a turn of a phrase that became socially and politically loaded. Right now, phrases like thoughts and prayers, I mean, it's a taunt from some people toward other people right now. And it's a triviality from some people toward other people when probably something more expressive of concern and care is in line. Somebody uses the phrase thoughts and prayers 2000 years from now, you'd be like, that means thoughts and prayers. I don't get it. But right now you drop that phrase and it is very, very loaded. Everybody's going to know what it means. And we could probably think about 100 more examples sitting here just like that that would pop in the mind of a modern audience right now in the same way that I think that phrase popped in the mind of the original audience way back in the first century. I think it doesn't make sense for Matthew to allow Jesus to come off like a jerk in this passage given all the other effort that Matthew is putting into making Jesus look good. I think what makes more sense is that Matthew, the original author, assumed this would make Jesus look good and that the original audience would be like, Oh, yep. Now that's what everybody says, isn't it? That's what we hear repeated all the time when it comes to why we don't let outsiders into our religion, because it's the old adage, you don't take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs. I think Jesus is citing something like that here. And I think the way he said it based on the woman's reaction means she knew exactly what he was doing to. Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll play along with this dance. But even the dogs eat the crumbs of fall from the master's table. Am I right? And did so many words? I think Jesus is saying, yeah, you are right. I am the son of David. I am the Christ. I am the Messiah. And yeah, that phrase that I just repeated sardonically is an absolute joke, because this always was for everybody. And blessed are you because you understood it way before everybody else did massive presumptuous, but yet context driven paraphrase is mine. All told, I just cannot bring myself to believe that this incredibly carefully crafted book that we've seen so far that Matthew has put together this very carefully put together apologetic, that Matthew just spaced off and was like, well, you know, you've got to be fair here. Like Jesus was also an idiot at times. Let's let a little bit of that come through just once. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't fit with the purpose of the book. I can only surmise that in the mind of Matthew, this exchange made Jesus look good and moved the theological football of this gift of God, this redemption being for all people, including Canaanites, the ancient enemies of the Jewish people. I can only assume that Matthew believed that this exchange moved that theological football forward in a way that was effective and in a way that the original audience would understand. Therefore, I read the passage the way I just described. Could I be wrong? Heck yeah, I could be wrong, because some of these passages are just tricky. But what you just got for me is my very best swing at it. We can agree on that read. We can disagree on that read. We can leave it in the I'm still thinking about it place in that read. But before we wrap up something else we have to do is just take a minute to acknowledge this woman, because I think she's spectacular. And I think the text is holding her out in a time where this would not have been a popular thing to do that is use a woman as a positive example. I think the text is holding her out as a positive example. And here's why. One, she's got a problematic pedigree just like us, unless you're Jewish. And even if you are Jewish and therefore not an ethnic outsider to a lot of this conversation, let's just take pedigree out to the more metaphorical level. We're born into problems. We make our own problems. We got read on our ledger and nobody really looks that impressive or presentable when compared with the flawless king of all things. So she's got a problematic pedigree just like us. She has incredible need just like us. Whether you're a person who rejects the supernatural and just here because you find this stuff interesting, which is awesome of you, or you're a person who really thinks there is something to the supernatural and the stuff of God described in this document. Either way, we got problems. We all agree on that. We all got problems and some of those problems are massive and seem like we can't do anything about it. So she has a problematic pedigree just like us, regardless of who we are, what we believe. She has incredible need just like us, regardless of who we are, what we believe. She can't do a dang thing about it. It's totally beyond her control, what she's dealing with. Just like us, regardless of what we believe. She recognizes her situation. It's not necessarily just like us. Sometimes we're maybe more acutely aware of what we're dealing with than where we're at and who we are. But sometimes we do not know thyself as well as we do at other points in life. She is at a point where she is at rock bottom. She's broken down by the situation at hand and by the love of a mother for her kid. And so she recognizes her situation further. I think the Canaanite woman is to be admired and emulated because she persists in her sorrow. Her love persisting is that even though she's sad, she's not paralyzed by it. She continues to love. She continues to try. She sees an opportunity here to try to make something right and that can but isn't always necessarily be just like us. I think Matthew was holding out this Canaanite woman to be admired and emulated also because she assumes a right posture before the king. I think Matthew is putting her in front of us as a great example of what to do in light of what you've seen so far in these 15 chapters. They look at who he is. Look at what he's done. Look at what he's said. Look at how he acts for crying out loud. Even this lady who's a total outsider. Maybe if you're reading this and you're a total outsider and it seems like this absolutely just shouldn't be for you any more than the yarn barn is a place for me. It is for you and assuming that proper posture. Like I know this is a bit of a controversial statement but I believe that assuming that proper posture before the king is what it is to become a Christian. There's a whole lot of theology and details and things that are fun for us to talk about and break down and they're important but at the most basic level the people in the Bible who are Christians are the ones who are like I follow Christ. And they might not be perfect and they might not know or get everything. It might be real clumsy and rudimentary even like the criminal on the cross or like this lady but that right posture before the king. I follow the king. That is the most basic assertion of being a Christian, of being saved to use the old religious language. So I think Matthew was holding out this Canaanite woman to be admired and emulated because she has a problematic pedigree. She's in a position of incredible need. She can't do anything about it. She recognizes her situation. She persists even in the midst of terrible sorrow and hurt. She assumes a proper posture before the king. And finally she sees Jesus for who he is. That is an act of faith. And just on the opposite page here in my Bible page 1489, Peter is going to rightly identify Jesus for who he is as well. She got it right before Peter, the human authority figure upon whom all of Western Catholicism is founded. Dang. Nice job, Canaanite lady. Look, my friends, and yes, that is the sound of me stretching because I recorded like the last five episodes all at once here. I set out to do like whatever 12 minutes on this thing. I don't know how far we are into it now, but it is a lot more than 12 minutes. And it's a tiny little passage and maybe it seems like on the surface, it just doesn't merit that much attention. Jesus was when a corporate retreat and some lady came up. It's like I got a problem. He seemed disinterested at first and then she said some stuff and he's like, okay, I'm interested now and he solved the lady's problem and that was that. But you've put ears and eyes on this with me for the last whatever it's been week now. There's something very potent about this moment, something that doubles and triples down on a whole bunch of the themes of the first half of the book of Matthew and something that seems like it is intentionally well placed at roughly the halfway point for the people who are reading this document to go, where am I with this? I don't know where I'm at with all of the religion and the institutions and all of the external noise about politics and social stuff and all that. I don't know. I don't want to play along with that game right now. But this is intended to strip away all of that stuff and bring the reader to a point where they say, where am I at right now with what I am figuring out about Jesus? Is there a chance that this Canaanite lady is right or is she wrong? And what I'm learning about here is a fascinating character with great wisdom and teaching and compassion though human. As I mentioned a couple of episodes ago, I first read this book end to end, I think in 1990, the notes in my old Bible at least indicate that then I read it again in 96. And then I've been through it a few times, I suppose, in the last handful of years. So that's a few trips through the thing. But a lot of these theological themes and the pacing details and the stuff about what it seems like Matthew is wanting to draw us to at each given point. I've never noticed any of that until I had you on the other end of the conversation. And so, yeah, this seems like a nice point here at the mid-season finale to say thank you. This really isn't one-sided. I know it might feel like that because it's just the nature of the medium. It's a podcast. But it doesn't feel that way to me. And just the knowledge that there are thousands upon thousands of people out there who are willing to take an honest run at this book with me, whether it's their first time through or their 10th time through, is having an effect on the way I ask questions and the way I think about it and the extra time that I find myself willing to take to look at these patterns and try to understand it really well. The point is you are all doing me a huge favor, a huge act of grace and friendship simply by being on the other end of this conversation and pushing me to think about what I believe is profound, gigantic, the deepest of deep water stuff with you. So I know I say a lot, like, I appreciate you and I mean it when I say it like that. But just here at the mid-season finale, let me just stress that even more. I really do appreciate you and I love doing this together and it's changing me. And I'm very thankful to you for that. I'm Matt. This is the 10-Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
