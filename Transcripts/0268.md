 Hey everybody, I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and I hope you're watching The Mandalorian on Disney Plus because it's so stinking good and it's good for everybody and maybe you don't like Star Wars and I can see that because it has not gone well lately and maybe you don't like sci-fi and I can see that because sometimes it feels a little elaborate and out there and maybe you're worried about shows that are on streaming services sometimes it seems like they're filled with stuff that's a little bit dark that maybe I don't mind so much but maybe you find really off putting, I'm telling you, you don't got to worry about any of this stuff. The Mandalorian is great, you are not getting a constant lecture about what you're wrong about politically, you are not getting moral superiority, you are just getting great storytelling, beautiful images, spectacular music, wonderful sound design, all while you follow a point of view character, a main character, who's flawed? And he's to figure some things out and he's not in Mary Sue and he gets beat up and he has problems but it feels more like a space western than it does sci-fi show and I think that's the genius of it. It's very episodic and in these episodes the Mandalorian, his name is Din Jaren I think, goes around to these different locations on different planets and it all feels like Shane or some other cowboy western where the gruff rugged drifter cowboy with the heart of gold and the big iron on his hip rolls into the town and he sees what's going wrong and he cleans it up. They even do see his spurs jingling when he walks into the space saloons when there are no actual spurs on him. It's just amazing but here's what's goofy about the main character in the show. You don't ever see his face because he's wearing a helmet all the time. It turns out that he's a part of a warrior cult that has all of these bizarre picky unish rules about what you can do and what you can't do and one of the biggest rules is you can't take off your helmet and other people can't see your face. Well think about how much you can give up if you can't take off your helmet. You can't eat with people or hang out with people. I mean it really is probably going to affect your ability to love somebody, to know and to be known and all of these things have affected the soul of this main character and it makes him likable and empathetic. And at first you're like these rules are stupid. I don't care about, I'm not invested in any of these rules. Take off your helmet. Just be a dude. But then the further along it goes you realize that he is so committed that these Mandalorians are so committed to these religious rules that they're willing to make serious sacrifices to honor this. They're willing to forfeit financial gain. They're willing to forfeit victory. They're willing to forfeit love and every time the Mandalorian honors his vows and honors his way and give something up, you as the viewer feel yourself becoming more committed to those picky, unish religious rules as it goes along. It's a very interesting thing to note the effect that it has on the person who's watching. Well imagine how much more so that would have an effect on the person who doesn't remove the helmet. Imagine how much more so that would have an effect on somebody who's gone their whole life making these sacrifices and their ancestors made these sacrifices. And we could have had these other things. We could have done this other stuff but we believe this is the way and so we've stuck to our guns even when it hurts. How hard would it be to move on from those values given all that sacrifice not just in your life but in generations past? Well that's a question we need to explore today as we consider Matthew chapter 12 and the Pharisees and religious leaders who are in opposition to Jesus over questions about the Sabbath. We've spent some time now looking at two big Sabbath controversies that happened back to back in Matthew chapter 12 verses 1 through 14 starting in verse 9. It says going on from that place he went into their synagogue and a man with a shriveled hand was there looking for a reason to accuse Jesus they asked him they being the Pharisees. Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? Jesus said to them. Many of you as a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to good on the Sabbath. Then he said to the man, stretch out your hand. So he stretched it out and it was completely restored just as sound as the other. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. Whoa that went nuclear. I get it. Okay you disagree about how you want to do your weekends and stuff and you disagree about some religious details and that's cool. But why is it such a big deal that they want to murder Jesus over it? Remember these are people who think they're right and they've been pushed to the brink of being down with maybe shedding blood killing somebody over this. Why are they so invested? Well here's why they're so invested because just like the Mandalorian they have given up a tremendous amount in service of these religious ideals, a profound honoring of the Sabbath. Now this honoring goes beyond like hey let's take it easy to do some rest maybe not going to mull along and take the trash out or whatever. No it's down to like am I allowed to pick up this bookmark that I just picked up with my left hand? Am I allowed to set it over here? What if I set it three feet further over there? Would that then constitute work? And part of the reason they're so committed to this way is because I think it's what God wants and part of the reason they're so committed to this way is that they felt their ancestors weren't committed enough and that God punished them for not being committed enough and they may have a point. So in the Mandalorian when push comes to shove there are lots of moments where taken off the helmet would make sense but the Mandalorian won't do it. He's committed. Likewise when we look at the history of the Jewish people that would have been relatively fresh in the minds of the original audience and the minds of the people who are engaging with Jesus here we see a lot of moments where it would have really benefited them to move on from their traditions and in fact we get a couple of very detailed recordings of such moments that I think will make you and me empathetic to the people who oppose Jesus even if we like Jesus way better because they made massive sacrifices to do what they believed to be right regarding the Sabbath even if I might not share those beliefs. So in 63 BC there's this guy named Nias Magnus Pompey I think I'm saying that right and Pompey is a part of the first triumvirate along with Julius Caesar and he's the big name and this first triumvirate or trio of leaders in the late Roman Republic expand the boundaries of Rome and change things politically and Pompey in part does this through conquest in the Eastern Mediterranean bringing the different kingdoms into league with Rome and making them subject states and in Josephus who is a Jewish guy who converted to the Roman side under pressure in his book The Antiquities of the Jews it's a history he gives us some details about how Pompey took Jerusalem in some ways it was a pretty standard siege but something different happened here during this particular siege of Jerusalem with the Romans outside the walls and the Jews inside the walls when Pompey showed up. It says here in book 14 chapter 4 of Josephus' antiquity of the Jews and I'm reading directly from it so this is an original first century source it says the Pompey pitched his camp near the north part of the temple where it was most practicable but even on that side there were great towers so the Jews had defenses there and a ditch had been dug and a deep valley begirt around it for the parts toward the city were precipices and the bridge on which Pompey had gotten it was broken down so Pompey has a problem here making this siege work the Jews were ready for him and the defenses are solid however a bank was raised day by day with a great deal of labor while the Romans cut down materials for it from the places round about okay so they're building these earthworks the Romans are to overcome the Jewish defenses Josephus goes on and when this bank was sufficiently raised and the ditch filled up though but poorly by reasons of its immense depth he brought his mechanical engines and battering rams from tire and placing them on the bank he battered the temple with the stones that were thrown against it and had it not been our practice our being the Jewish people's practice from the days of our forefathers to rest on the seventh day this bank could never have been perfected by reason of the opposition the Jews would have made for though our laws give us leave to defend ourselves against those that begin to fight with us and assault us yet it does not permit us to meddle with our enemies while they do anything else are you understanding what Josephus is saying here there is a technicality in the second temple oral law not the Old Testament written law that said if your enemies are like throwing rocks at you or attacking you you can fight them but if they're not actually attacking you you just have to let them do what they're doing i'm not touching you i'm not touching you i'm not touching you that's what pom pay figured out so he's like okay let's just keep building these siege ramps on Sabbath days only then and he does and it works picking it up with Josephus it says this is a thing the Romans understood on those days which we call Sabbaths they threw nothing at the Jews nor came to any pitched battle with them but raised up their earthen banks and brought their engines into such forwardness that they might do execution the next days and anyone may hence learn how very great piety we exercise toward god and the observance of his laws since the priests were not at all hindered from their sacred administrations by their fear during the siege and he goes on to describe that the priests right up until the moment they were run through just continued to carry out their sacrifices and that the Jewish people never lifted a hand and if we skip forward a few paragraphs here's the result this is what the Jewish people got for honoring the oral traditions surrounding their Sabbath pom pay breached the walls he took Jerusalem and quote he made Jerusalem tribute to the Romans what Josephus is describing here is the event that ended the free state that the Maccabean rebellion brought about around a century earlier these were free people they weren't governed by anybody they set up their own kingdom they won all of these very costly battles people died there was suffering and carnage but they threw off their Greek overlords had their own kingdom and then the Romans grow in power and they show up and they have this confrontation and if they had just defended themselves they could have warded off pom pay but they didn't you think that's going to stay with them in their cultural memory what if we just didn't fight Hitler that hard because he exploited some loophole in one of our can't remove your helmet can't defend the walls on the Sabbath type traditions that we were absolutely married to you think now better part of a century after the fact we wouldn't be changed or have some great sense of sacrifice and even piety that comes with hey we lost and we lost bad but we did the right thing because we were honoring God now that would be baked into our psyche as Nazi occupied Americans and likewise it was baked into the psyche of the people who are talking with Jesus here again within the century or less of the events that Josephus is describing right here much like the Mandalorians not pulling off that helmet and it costs him something so the Jewish people were not pulling off that oral tradition surrounding the Sabbath whether it's legit or not they stuck to it and it cost him something and when you pay something for that kind of a commitment this is a noble thing this is a good thing honestly it's going to take a lot like maybe even more than somebody's hand growing back out of thin air even somebody coming back from the dead for some people who are deeply committed to this tradition and deeply sensitive to what they believe was given up in the service of God to shift gears to see who Jesus is and what his kingdom is about and to jump in with that very quickly the reason we got to take time to think about stuff like this is because if we don't understand the quality of the critics of Jesus and we just make them into these goofball caricatures who are irrational and do only silly ridiculous things Jesus actions make less sense and we understand the text poorly but if we humanize the opponents of Jesus and understand them in their historical context and understand their rational if maybe flawed motives we understand Jesus we understand the text better and consequently we have a better chance of figuring out what we do with it and where we fit into this big story as well thanks for being willing to go down the history rabbit hole with me a little bit here more tomorrow I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon you
