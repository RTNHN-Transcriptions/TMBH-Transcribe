 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and I got this thing that I do. I think I've told you about it before. I don't know what it means about me. Probably some of you who listen to this are therapists, and you're going to feel this strong temptation to email me and tell me what's wrong with me. I don't know. Maybe do that. Maybe don't. I haven't decided how I want you to respond, but I got this thing where late at night, right before I go to sleep. Sometimes I will flashback. Flashback is too strong or this sounds like PTSD. I don't think it's quite at that level. I will just go in my mind, perusing stupid, cringe-worthy things that I said from my past, not necessarily mean things, not necessarily offensive things, just, oh, you poor insecure boy, who says, poor, dumb, insecure things from time to time. And ah, wow, remember that one? It just pains me. It's agonizing to think about that stuff because it's these moments of realization, but it's not like I go to the same one again and again and again. You know, I'm a little bit extroverted. I'm a little bit out there at times socially willing to take a few risks. And that means that there's just as nearly infinite well of stupid things I've said and done, and they will occur to me as I'm laying there. And oftentimes they're brand new. And I haven't revisited that memory from that corner of my brain from my distant past in decades, but then I go back to it for some reason. I'm like, oh, yeah, I remember that. And I remember, oh, oh my goodness, that's what I said, wasn't it? Oh, no. Oh, I did that. Oh, it just hurts. We are going to watch a guy in the passage we're looking at today go all the way from beginning to end through that entire process, not over the course of decades, but over the course of like three minutes and it's brutal to watch, not because stupid Peter doing stupid Peter things again, but because Peter is the point of view character for us, the reader, because Peter is the guy we're supposed to be able to relate to in his bigness, brashness, boldness, cowardice, stupidity, brilliance, mixed bagginess. And here the mixed bag presents one of the real low points for poor Peter. We talked about last time. This is a split scene where high drama is happening in juxtaposition with more subtle drama inside and outside of the place of power where Caiaphas and the other horde of religious leaders are goulishly punching, beating, smacking, mocking, spitting on Jesus. And outside Peter, the last one who's even kind of there to sort of vaguely support him, but has no plan. I mean, theoretically, John is around somewhere, but we really don't know where at this point. Peter's like the last of the last who would be like in normal world circumstances, normal plot circumstances, be like, this is Jesus last hope to write in, rescue him, or do something. And instead, this is what we get from Peter right after we hear about Jesus getting punched and spit on his slapped and mocked. Now Peter, Matthew 2669 was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him. You were also with Jesus of Galilee, she said, but he denied it before them all. I don't know what you're talking about, he said. Then he went out to the gateway where another girl saw him and said to the people there, this fellow, this fellow right here, this fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth. He denied it again with an, oh, I don't know the man. After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, oh, surely you're one of them. Your accent gives you away. Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, I don't know the man immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken before the rooster crows. You'll disown me three times. And he went outside and wept bitterly. There was a version of me once that would have read this and been like, Peter, you idiot again, like, oh, Elijah Moses and Jesus are here and God's here. We should build hearts. Stupid Peter. Oh, Jesus out there, if he can walk on water, probably I could. I'm going to do it. Oh, maybe I can't stupid Peter. No way, Lord. I'm never going to let that kind of stuff happen to you. I'll stupid Peter, but it's not where I'm at anymore. I am stupid Peter. I totally get the humanness of this guy. I totally get what it's like to be somebody who little more vulnerability here. Here we go. Totally wants to try to take some swings. I want to try. I think there's a God. I don't totally understand him. I don't know all the things about him. I think that the Christianity thing and the Bible thing, I think they point to the truest realist thing ever. I don't totally understand them. Even after all this time and after that we've put into it, I do not have the Bible solved. I'm still working on it. I just haven't got it all whipped and totally straight in my head yet, but man, I think there's something to it. And I think there's something to it enough that I'm willing to, I guess, I mean, you're listening, I'm talking that I'm willing to go and take a risk in front of people because I think there's something to it and it has my curiosity and fascination. I sense it has yours. All right. I'll try. Let's think about it together. Let's try to make sense of it together. Let's maybe even try to do something with it at some point in the process together. And then you say and do stupid stuff. Then in your zeal or your insecurity or whatever, you know, some of it, you're like, Hey, that was a good trial like that. And other stuff you're like, Oh, me. Wow. Bless my heart. I do try if nothing else. And I don't know if we're honest with ourselves. Maybe we all feel that way. But man, I relate to Peter and I just don't want to get on his case. I get it. His world is spinning. He doesn't know what to do. And he starts to feel accused and yelled at and he doesn't know if this is going to be a death sentence. Maybe he's not quite ready to die yet. And so some little girl comes over and is like, what? Hey, aren't you like, didn't I see you? He's like, crap, my whole plan was just that nobody knew what I looked like. Is it my beard? I need to lose some weight. Do I stand out that much? But whatever the case, I can't let that be right. No, I don't even what I don't even know you're talking about. Now, just remember that let me see how many pages I have to turn. You can hear it when I turn pages. There's one. And then there's that's it. I don't even have to turn another one. Okay. So back to the beginning of 26. All right. Jesus told them this very night you will all fall away on account of me for it's written now. That's right. Zechariah 13, I will strike the shepherd in the sheep of the flock will be scattered, but after I've risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee. And then Peter replied, even if all fall away on account of you, I never will. He just said that. And then some little girl comes up and is like, Hey, didn't I see what that guy? No, no, no. And he's willing to abandon everything about what he just boldly pledged just like a minute ago, not a minute ago, but a couple hours ago, he's willing to punt on all of that stuff. And I don't think it's because he's a bad guy. I don't think it's because he's a weak man. I think it's because he's a man. I think it's because he's a person and he's a mixed bag. He's willing to take big chances, but also he's into self preservation and he's willing to endure pain, but sometimes maybe not as excited about enduring pain in the end. He endured a whole lot of pain. And I don't know. God bless Peter. It didn't take much to absolutely obliterate that big bold boast that he made a page ago, but I don't think I even would have gone into the building. I think it would have scattered with the others. So no judgment for me, Peter. You're doing your best buddy. So then he goes out and other people are like, Hey, it's another girl. He's like, ah, that's that's one of them right there. I'm pretty sure. And I guess the servants of this household would be mad. Maybe Peter is getting defensive because maybe these are servants of the household the same way that Malchus guy who got his ear cut off by Peter was like, maybe they're taking that a little bit personally. They're like, Hey, didn't you just like name my coworker with the sword earlier? Is that the one? The guy was swinging the sword around. Maybe they're making that connection. And Peter thinks he's about to get like beaten or bludgeoned or I don't know what he thinks is going to happen. I do suspect from the text that these accusations are not entirely positive. So he denies it again. Like, dang it. People shut up. You're ruining my covert infiltration gig. And then after a little while, somebody's like, you sound, you sound different. Like you're clearly Galilean. I wonder if that moment, like when Peter says the next line, when he's, he runs all of this stuff and he's calling down curses and yelling, I don't know the man. I wonder if he acts like that girl on season eight of alone who was both from land or Wyoming and also a little bit from England. And she couldn't decide on what accent she was going to have. And so then sometimes she would have it and sometimes not. And you know what seemed like a nice girl, not sure what was going on with the accent or what was happening there psychologically or what demons she was wrestling with or working through. But I kind of wonder if Peter tried to do that here. And he was like, what no, no, uh, cross my head. I don't know the man. You are. It's all the accents at one. I don't even know which one this is. And then he just runs out and weeps bitterly both because of his horrible attempted to disguise accent, but probably more so because of the thing where he made a big bold boast about he would never let these things happen to Jesus. And then he totally bails on him and denies him three times. Another thing that's really crazy about this though is that if you go back to the stuff that happens immediately before the cut, the jump here to the other half of the scene back out with Peter, we go back into the building with Jesus in verses 67 and 68. And remember what's going on? They're mocking Jesus for being a prophet prophesied to us Christ. Who hit you? He just did prophesy that someone would strike out against him, deny him backstab him. And then we cut to the outside scene and his prophecy comes true. The way that Matthew has structured this in these teeny, tiny little notes and subtleties that, Hey, if you didn't catch it, it's just fine. You're going to understand the whole book. But if you do, you just marvel at it the way he structured that the way he built this book, it is incredible how there are these multiple layers of overtness that illustrate the point that drive at home with clever irony and juxtaposition poor Peter. This guy wants to get it right. This guy's a true believer. He's in. He's not trying to deny God and embarrass Jesus. He's trying to help. He's trying to figure out what his role is and what his place is in this whole kingdom thing. He doesn't even have a Bible yet because it's not even written. This is a tough spot that he's in. And yeah, ultimately human frailty gets the best of him in security fear, whatever gets the best of him. And he blows it. He fails the test. The only one we see in the whole text and fairness who passes all the tests is Jesus. So Peter, he's just like you or me. And I got a tip that kept to this guy. I don't think he's just like me. I think he's better than me. Yeah, this trip through Matthew is really soft in my heart toward Peter. And I feel empathy toward that disgusting gross just go stand in the shower and watch the water run down the drain as you question who you are and what the heck you're doing kind of feeling. I just can't imagine what the pit of his stomach was like after this brutal pivotal moment in his life. And as tough as this all is for Peter and his worthwhile is I think it is for us to take a whole day here to just reflect on that and think about it. Even tougher is the fact that Jesus, he didn't do nothing wrong and has been the good guy throughout. He just got finally and ultimately abandoned. Peter just ran out the door in embarrassment and humiliation. He's not coming to save Jesus. He's not coming to bail him out. He's not coming to have his back. He's outside crying right now. Jesus is entirely solo, taking this abuse and this humiliation and this injustice on his own. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again.
