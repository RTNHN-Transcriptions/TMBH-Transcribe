 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Joshua. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Have you ever got together with a bunch of friends, family, whatever, and you're going to watch a movie, but it's a movie that's a part of a larger series, and then somebody who hasn't seen them all asks the obvious question, well, do I need to see the other ones in order for this to make sense? Sometimes you're like, no, the movie we're about to watch is a perfect one-off movie. You're going to be just fine. Other times you think about it for a minute, you're like, yeah, yeah, this one's not going to make a ton of sense unless you see it in the larger context. Joshua is the latter. You really need to see this one in the larger context of all of the other books we've seen so far and all the ones that are to come for it to make sense. Now, just straight through the front door, if you treat Joshua like a one-off and you don't look at all of the other books of the Bible with it, it feels like an ancient Near Eastern conquest account with some chest thumping and a large percentage of the book being dedicated to justifying current boundaries for future generations, a very common genre in the ancient world. But if you've read all the other books of the Bible so far and you read what comes after it, then instead Joshua comes off as something very unique, even though it employs some aspects of the genre that would be familiar to the original audience, it comes off like an important chapter in a much bigger redemptive story. God makes the world at a nothing. He makes people in his own image. Things fall apart. They choose rebellion. They choose sin. They choose failure. God is going to fix the problem through a family, one guy's descendants, Abraham. He makes a covenant, an unconditional covenant with Abraham to say, even if you're an idiot, I'm doing this, I'm going to redeem through you. You're going to be this great people, this great nation. You're going to have this land where you can set up shop for the long haul and redemption for the whole world is going to come through you. You're going to be a blessing to all the nations. God leads them out of slavery in Egypt. Now, we're ready to go conquer the land, the generation that got led out of Egypt in Exodus. There's not up for it. They complain a lot and they like the desert better, I guess. And now the next generation takes over and as we go into Joshua, we're going to enter the promised land of Canaan, but there are people in there. Now, in those first five books of the Bible, we've learned a little bit about these people. It's a mess. This is very ugly. They're doing child murder stuff and this society is held out even by ancient world standards as being uniquely screwed up. And it looks as though God, who's already demonstrated that he is willing to show mercy, but also willing to judge. It looks like he's got Canaan in the crosshairs and he intends to use his own very flawed people group, the Israelites, to go and be the instrument of his punishment against Canaan, but also to establish his chosen people in a place where they won't get wiped off the map and forgotten the history. And that is the conundrum of Joshua that we got to understand before we even crack open this book. We're not talking about the era of the UN where deciding boards somewhere and whoever has the most guns and most nukes kind of decides who gets to live where and what maintains the general balance of a very fragile political stability that we keep trying to duct tape together around planet Earth. It's not like that at all. Here you got all kinds of families, people, chieftains, warlords, tribes running all around the ancient Near East. Some of those gel and with stability, especially around predictable weather and water, they grow into a people, a nation, a kingdom, maybe even an empire. Everybody else, they get lost, absorbed gradually. And I know this next thing sounds horrifying in modern terms, but we're talking about a very different time, very different pressures. Gradually, most of these forgotten tribes just get bred out of existence. They get absorbed into another people group and they're not even a footnote in history. We don't know anything about them. Their language, their story, their beliefs about God, any of that stuff. So in an ancient Near Eastern context, any reader looking at the first five books of the Bible and now into Joshua, considering what to make of these people who apparently are chosen by the one true God, look, you're going to have to have a place to set up shop and you're going to have to have a lot of numbers. That's why the book of numbers celebrates the numbers. That's why there's all of that stuff about the census. That book points out that God kept his promise to Abraham that he would be this big numerous people. Joshua then is the book that's the fulfillment about the thing about, hey, you're going to have a land which would be the burning question for everybody in the original audience as to whether this people group is going to continue to exist or go away like everybody else. If you're nomadic at this point in history and you don't eventually find a place to get down roots, build things, raise crops, defend your boundaries, etc., you just go away. Well, that doesn't square very well with the redemptive plan we've learned about in the first five books of the Bible. Now, my seem to you like, when are we actually going to get to Joshua? No, no, no, this is Joshua. All the other books around it do the heavy lifting on how this book works. So Joshua's the main character of the book of Joshua, but the text does not hold him out as being the author of this book. The text doesn't tell us who the author is, even though Joshua clearly contributed to parts of it. But to get into the specific of the guts of this book itself, it looks like it pretty neatly divides into two parts. The first part is the conquest. The second part is what are you going to do with it? The first part is violent and shocking to modern sensibilities. Wasn't shocking to modern sensibilities even 50 or 60 years ago, but we are at a different point in history. And we're asking, I think, good moral questions about how we ought to treat each other and what role violence should play in international politics. And so I'm glad that we balk at some of the stuff that we see here. But effectively, what we get on the pages of Joshua in the first half of the book is the story of a theocracy. God has held himself out as king. He's done enough stuff to make it clear that he's actually there and that this isn't just some cooke prophet who goes off in some little corner in secret and is like, I learned some new secret stuff. No, the giving of all of the law to Moses happened on the mountain and people could see the evidence of God's presence and thunder and everything that was going on up there. And then all of the miracles and stuff that happens in the desert. And it's important to note that this theocracy was led by the actual visible physical presence of God in the form of this cloud, this presence that is moving them around through the desert. That's always there. It doesn't make any sense. It defies reality. So if somebody today comes along as like, I think God told me that we should probably go and wipe out this country and just occupy it because of religious reasons, well, my first question would be, is there a giant physics-defying cloud that is present through the entire process? And do you have dozens and dozens of miraculous things occurring to back it up? Because that is what we're seeing in Joshua. God is held out as being king here. Well, the other theme we see through this is that stressing of that covenant God made with Moses throughout the conquest portion of the first half of the book. Every time the Israelite people act like the Canaanite people or don't do what God said, God punishes his own people with the same vigorous impulse to justice that he's punishing the Canaanites with. So it's not like they're getting a sweetheart deal here. And after one particular conquest, somebody selfishly decides to break the rules and be like, I'm going to take care of my own provision and no longer trust God for his provision. And it's not until justice is carried out for that crime against the king, which in this case is literally God, that victories can resume and this conquest can continue. There's a lot of language throughout this conquest portion of the book that sounds like a complete annihilation of the Canaanite people took place. And some people look at that and I just has to be hyperbole, in part because we still hear about Canaanites being around later. There's a little story in the middle about the Gibeonites and a deal that they work through tremendous shrewdness to be spared by the invading Israelites. Obviously there's a story of Rahab, the harlot, who favors the spies who come to Jericho and is spared when Jericho's walls fall down in the famous story about the music and the march going around the walls of Jericho. So maybe the language in the book of Joshua by everybody got put to the sword and they completely destroyed this city or this kingdom or whatnot. Maybe it's really close to literal. Maybe there's a decent amount of hyperbole involved. Ultimately, you need to read the book of Joshua and see what you make of that for yourself. The second half of Joshua doesn't take as much time to cover because it's dominated by the dividing up of the land, the little Canaanite local kingdoms and the coalitions that have come together. They're all defeated and now you can sit down in a tent with a great big map and spread it out and decide who's going to go where and that's exactly what we get is a vivid description of the boundaries of all of the land allocated to the effectively the sons of Jacob, the sons of Israel. And to you and me, it's going to seem really boring, but to the original audience, this is a huge deal because one, it's demonstrative of how completely the Canaanites were defeated. You have the run of the land. You can carve it up however you want at this point. Again, that seems pretty odious to modern sensibilities coming out of the age of colonialism. This is a different moral equation that while still complex, you have to run with different variables in place. But that's where we're at. And so the original audience, they would have had any compunction about this. They would have been like, awesome. That's victory. We're no longer going to die as a people. They're going to get roots down. This is what it takes to stand the test of time instead of going extinct as a people group. And to the very attentive reader, they would have been like this map scene is so exciting that dominates chapters 13 through 22 because it means that we can now kind of see a way that the massively exciting promises of God that we get way back earlier in the Old Testament might work out. There's got to be a people group here that has to stand the test of time. Now we can imagine a pathway that gets us there. But I also think that chapters 13 through 22 where the land gets all carved up would be very exciting because it demonstrates the fulfillment of the promised Abraham. How is this ragtag group of people for all that they've been through ever going to end up somewhere that they could put down roots and stand the test of time? Well, it was complicated. It involved a lot of wacky miraculous stuff and two partings of bodies of water and all kinds of other wild stuff. But dang, here we are. After all that, we get to the very end. Joshua is an old guy now and he gets everybody together. And he's like, all right, we have got to leave this group with clarity on what the deal between them and God is. This is not a normal kingdom. God is king here and Israel must serve him to honor their side of the covenant if they want to keep this land and make it work. And in keeping with all of that, I think we get the most famous line from Joshua at the very end of the book in this scene, Joshua 24 14 moving forward. Joshua's talking to all the people now and he says, now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness. Put away the gods that your forefathers served beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the Lord. If it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your father served in the region beyond the river or the gods of the Amorites and whose land you dwell. But as for me in my house, we'll serve the Lord. And then after Joshua says that the people were like, no, we're totally with you on that. And they set up a stone memorial to remember what they agreed to do right there. Then interesting side note, that theme of memorial keeps coming up throughout the book of Joshua because that's the seventh stone monument or memorial that has been put up. I think that's really one of the key themes just in general of Joshua. It's remember what God has done and pick the right stuff moving forward. Now in light of this call to remember the rest of the Old Testament is going to play out at times like a tragedy as God's people do not remember what happened and what was etched on those stones. When you visualize a book of Joshua picture Jericho's walls falling down when you think about the theme reflect on God establishing his flawed people in the promised land and how he becomes the king of those flawed people. Maybe if you want one more little bit of theme to reflect on, just boil it down to these two words. Remember and obey. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, check out Joshua six, which is the whole Jericho story and Joshua 24, which is the covenant renewal right at the very end. Good job.
