 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Philippians. The Book of Philippians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to a church he founded on his first missionary journey on mainland Europe, the mainland part of Greece, that is, in a town called Philippi. Now Philippi has got a long, long history. It goes way back in prominence to the mid 400s BC when the Macedonians, a Greek-ish people group from up north came down and conquered a bunch of Greek territory under the leadership of a guy named Philip II. And took this town, I was like, I'm going to name it after myself. So we called it Philippi. Now Philipp II died shortly thereafter, and his very famous son, after receiving a bunch of tutoring from Aristotle himself, his very famous son, Alexander the Great, took over from Philipp and then he went and conquered the entire known world and scrambled up the whole map and all the culture of everything. And so Philippi was a town that enjoyed a role of prominence for a very long time. But for some reason, and I don't think the fancy people who studied this know exactly why it fell out of prominence somewhere in the middle of the 100s BC. But then there was a gigantic incident there that put it back in the spotlight and thrust it into prominence and significance right after the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. You remember the guy who did that, right? If you want to say it out loud to impress people who are standing right there, you can do it. It's Brutus, a two-brute. Brutus and his pals square off in a great big giant Roman civil war against the people who are from the party of Julius Caesar led by Julius Caesar's godson Octavian. And they all end up at Philippi in mainland Greece, and they have a great big battle there to settle who's going to get Rome in the wake of the murder of Julius Caesar. And the winners turn out to be Octavian and Mark Antony. Now Octavian would become the first emperor of Rome. He takes on the title Caesar Augustus. He's the one who calls for the census that gets things rolling with the birth narrative of Jesus. Brutus and his forces are defeated there outside of Philippi and Brutus decides to take his own life rather than face the music for all of that. Well, at this point to signal to the world that we really don't need to fight anymore. We got this all settled up. The people who did wrong have been punished and control of the government is back where it should be. Octavian, that is Caesar Augustus, just lets a bunch of his troops quit. He's like, you did everything I asked you to do. Thank you guys so much. And he lets them colonize this somewhat dormant community of Philippi. So it's a place like Corinth that has a bunch of Greek history to it, but it becomes a Roman colony and these soldiers who get to quit the army and take a stipend and they're set for life because they helped Augustus secure Rome. I mean, they're going to love him forever and they're going to teach their kids to love the emperor and so on and so forth. And so when Paul shows up in Philippi in Acts chapter 16, he's going into a very pro-Roman city where they're going to be all in on the cult of the emperor. The emperor is a living God and the office of emperor is basically the patron of Philippi. We exist at the emperor's good pleasure. So they don't want anything that could unsettle things or mess with their standing or the great reputation and relationship they have with the throne back in Rome. But Paul holds out Jesus as being a king and as we're going to see in Colossians next time around, he holds out Jesus as being supreme over all things. And that's very threatening. So stuff doesn't go perfectly in Philippi, but a church is established there nonetheless. And it turns out that in the crucible of this difficult environment and all the pressure that is put on this church in this very pro-Roman colony of Philippi, they actually thrive. So many years later, when Paul, now a much older man, is sitting in a Roman prison, writing letters reflecting on his life, wondering if maybe this might be it for him, he is surprised and pleased to receive this beautiful gift from the people of this church. He founded clear over in Greece and Philippi delivered by a guy named a paphroditis. And apparently it was a pretty harrowing journey for a paphroditis to get there with this gift. And Paul is overwhelmed by the generosity. He's so appreciative of being remembered by the people at this church. And further, he's so grateful personally to a paphroditis that it looks like out of that joy, he sits down and pens a letter that I have read many, many, many, many times over, including multiple times in preparation for this conversation. And I still can't find the structure to it. Instead, it looks to me like he just has a handful of things that he wanted to say, born out of this heart of gratitude and a clarity that comes with maybe facing the end of life and feeling good about how you've lived. It just looks like he has some stuff that he wants to say to these people at this church who've just given him this gift that he's really grateful for. And so he tears into it and he opens by giving an extended greeting section where he talks about his own circumstances and how he is at peace with that. He famously says that to live his Christ and to die is gain. And we get a cool look inside his head as he reflects on how much he appreciates this church and also how much he appreciates what his life has looked like in Christ, whether he's got the opportunity ahead of him to go and do more stuff or whether this might be it for him as he faces possible execution in Rome. Well, from there, he doubles down on this theme of humility that runs through all of the sections in the book of Philippians. And all of that emphasis on humility is all born out of the example of Christ. And here at the beginning of chapter two, we get one of the most famous chunks of the whole New Testament in terms of poems and songs in the New Testament. It's surely one of the three or four most often quoted and celebrated and appreciated. It draws on a bunch of imagery from the Old Testament, especially deeply on the latter half of the book of Isaiah. And it's easier for me to relay the feel of it by just reading it. Most Bibles will present this, by the way, in the form of verse. So I assume it was a song or maybe a hymn that maybe Paul is even quoting here. Maybe he wrote it while he was sitting in prison. I don't know, but it's beautiful. It goes like this. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus and this is where the verse starts. Who, being in very nature, God, did not consider equality with God, something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross. Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Here we see hints of one of Paul's favorite themes and all of his writing once again that all will bow that this is for everybody. Again, that Jesus is supreme, that Jesus is doing the will of the Father is just rich, thick, creamy, center-cut Christian theology about Jesus himself right there. And then Paul goes on to say, hey, speaking of that example of humility, you know who's doing that? My protege, Timothy, you know who else is doing that? Your guy, Apaphroditis, who risked himself to bring me this gift and to encourage me and show me care when I was in this difficult situation in prison. It seems like from there, Paul flows out of what those two are getting right and says that he hopes and he feels that he's getting it right and that that example of Christ's humility has been the guidepost for how his life has been built and that all of the fancy works that he did back in the day, all of his supposed self-righteousness back when he persecuted Christians and was this great religious zealot. It's like all of that stuff is trash. It's garbage in comparison with simply having Christ. The soft-heartedness continues as apparently Apaphroditis has told Paul that there's some squabbling going on between a couple of ladies at church, a gal named Yodia and another lady named Sintakey. And Paul just peaceably appeals for them in light of all of these bigger, better, more important things to work that out and find peace together. And then he rounds out his thoughts again, like a guy who's made peace with this maybe being the end by saying that he's found the secret to contentedness and surprise. The secret to that is in Christ. When you visualize the book of Philippians, picture a surprise gift for a prisoner. When you think about the theme, reflect on Christ's humility and example. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go back and read chapter two verses six through 11 for yourself. Hey, one other tip on the way out the door. These books right here, Galatians and Ephesians, the last two we looked at, and then Philippians today and Colossians, which we have next time around. There's a little acronym to keep these straight that I have always used. And it's very helpful for remembering what order these go in. It's simply go eat popcorn, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians. If you didn't know that one already, I think it's going to make your life better. That's it Philippians leveled up.
