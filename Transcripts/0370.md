 Hey, everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast, and I literally picked the town that we're going to be talking about here 10 seconds before I hit record so that this would be spontaneous because that makes it more fun. I have chosen the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and now I would like for you and I to brainstorm what that town makes you think of. Go. All right, I'm going to go first. I got Rocky. What do you have? Ah, cheesesteaks. That's a very, very good answer, Sarah. Thank you for that. Okay, I'm going to go with Founding Fathers, colonial stuff, Revolutionary War stuff. What do you got? Oh, okay, that was excellent, Mike. You're going with modern liberalism. It's associated with kind of a left leaning community. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. That's great. Okay, I'm going to go next and go with throwing batteries at Santa Claus at Eagles games and having incredibly unruly fans who are very hard on their own team. All right, Sandy, you're up. Oh, very good. You went with the city of brotherly love, like the old school meaning of the name. And is that a little bit ironic based on what I just said? Maybe so, but maybe there's something about the history of the place that lends itself toward that. Maybe somebody else said the Liberty Bell. The point is this, Philadelphia means a ton of different things. And just saying the name of the town doesn't immediately take you to one place mentally. It takes you to a lot of different places. And so I suppose that if I was trying to do some kind of thing where I wanted to do a photo op or make like a big point to be like this is where the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and all of its grand importance is going to go next. And we're going to gather in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for me to make that point because of what Philadelphia symbolizes, you'd probably all be like, wait, which thing that it symbolizes, do you mean? I know you thought this would be profound and it'd be really obvious, but nobody knows what symbolism you're actually drawing on. That is the kind of situation we're about to run into in Matthew chapter 16, where Jesus for whatever reason, reasons will explore more carefully in the upcoming episodes has decided to sail across the Sea of Galilee from what looks to have been the western side where he had yet another unfortunate showdown with the Pharisees and Sadducees. And then he's going to get a boat. He's going to sail across the Sea of Galilee to the eastern side. And along the way, he has the exchange with the nervous disciples about bread, whether they forgot to pack bread or what bread or what yeast Jesus actually means. He of course is like, no, I didn't mean sandwiches. You guys are fine. I mean, watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and its infectious, transmissible nature. And so then he sails to the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. Every time he comes back into Jewish territory, he's in a fight. He gets bombarded by people and it's clear that Jesus' agenda as we're getting into and past the middle of the book of Matthew is like, I need somebody to understand who I am and what I'm doing here. I need somebody to be able to answer the question, who am I? And to be able to pick up the banner of this whole kingdom thing and move forward with it because Jesus has already made it clear twice referencing this sign of Jonah that he's going to die. It sure looks like that's what he's hinting at. And those hints are going to become a lot more overt very soon. So we cross back out of Jewish territory and over to the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee because this is just why we can't have nice things. We can't hang out in Jewish territory because there's always going to be a fight. And that's not a negative reflection on Jewish people as humans. Good heavens. No. That's a reflection of the social reality of the moment that we're reading about here in Matthew chapter 16. So we're going to pick it up in verse 13 where it says, when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, who do people say the son of man is? Before, we can get into the trillion dollar question of this entire book, the question that isn't just being asked of the disciples, but that is being asked of the original audience, that is being asked of the modern reader, that is being asked of you and me while we even have the conversation, whether we are coming at this with a predisposition toward belief or unbelief, everybody's being asked to the question. People are going to come to different conclusions. But before we can get to this absolutely pivotal exchange that's about to happen here, we got to work through the geography because I don't think the geography is ever a throw away in the book of Matthew. And here's what I mean by that. Matthew, when he doesn't need us to know where it is because there isn't a cultural or theological significance to where a thing happened, that is it doesn't advance the point, it isn't meant to strike the original audience as, whoa, the people there though, they thought this and this and this. And then Jesus did that and oh, that means even more. If there isn't any mileage to be gained, Matthew seems content to skip those geographical details. But when the geographical details make a point, he seems to spell out where they are. So it is a safe bet that if Matthew has got this little scroll that he has the ability to write all of this stuff down on and he's no doubt engaged in some sort of editorial process. I mean, this is internally evident from the way the book of Matthew is structured, that if he uses up a couple of words to tell us where he is, there's probably a meaning to that. But that with this Caesarea Philippi thing. So Caesarea Philippi, what do we know? First of all, we got to disambiguate this thing from another Caesarea and that is Caesarea Maritima, Caesarea on the coast. Both Caesarea Maritima and Caesarea Philippi were built up during the time of Herod the Great and both of them were monuments to Rome, to Caesar. In this case, it would have been Caesar Augustus, the first emperor of Rome, the god son of Julius Caesar, who never was an emperor of Rome. This then is the same Caesar Augustus who called for the census that gets everything rolling at the beginning of Luke with the account of Jesus birth. So you've got a new deity here. That is the deity, the cult of the emperor. And this is going to come into conflict with Christianity. I'm ramming my fists together in that conflict gesture. This is going to come into conflict with Christianity again and again and again for several centuries here. And Herod, he's a sellout. I mean, that's always been the knock on Herod is that he's supposed to be this leader who is representative of local religious sensibilities within the Roman client king system, but he's not. He's an outsider and he's not really into the god of the Israelites. He's not really into the god of the Hebrew people, the Jews. He's really into the god that most people throughout history worship. And that is the god of the state, the god of pure unadulterated power. Push comes the shove. That's who most people are going to bend the knee to. And Herod is no exception. Pontius Pilate, same thing. A couple decades after the death of Herod the Great Pontius Pilate is always sniveling and groveling to try and make his Caesar Tiberius in that case. Super happy. Look how much I love you. There's more adulation and building and parades. Look, you're the best Caesar of all the Caesar's ever. So this was clearly a cultural expectation of these local rulers to make it clear how overly abundantly lavishly they appreciated the leadership of the great godman Caesar in Rome. Well, Caesarea Maritima and Caesarea Philippi were both built to exalt the great godman, the emperor of Rome. Now Caesarea Maritima is very famous. You can still go there. It's a gigantic archaeological park. I've done some videos there. The pilot stone was discovered there that specifically names Pontius Pilate and it's where Paul was in prison and sat through some trials or conversations, if you will, with some later Roman governors after Pilate. It's where Paul sailed from on his clumsy, even bordering on disastrous journey to Rome to go to prison there to talk with the emperor. So that place is a big deal, but this is totally different. Caesarea Philippi is way up north of Galilee, 25 ish miles north and maybe just a little bit east of the Sea of Galilee. It's about the same latitude as tire. So Jesus and the disciples are way back up north again, getting away from it all. Jesus clearly intends to take this time to invest in the disciples and try to get them to a place where they acknowledge that they get who he is and what's actually going on here. But there's a billion places Jesus could have gone to do this. Maybe politics are part of the explanation here. This part of the world was under the authority of Herod Philip. He didn't really have much interest in a lot of the same political things that we see bringing tons of pressure to bear in Galilee and Judea. So maybe it was just a place of mild political respite or maybe Jesus was trying to make some point because there were a billion different metaphors that Caesarea Philippi could come to represent. Now today, I believe still today, this area is referred to as Banius, B-A-N-I-A-S, which is derived, I think it's got to be connected. I guess I don't know this for sure. From the ancient Greek God, Pan, the key geological feature of Caesarea Philippi is this cave called the cave of Pan that predates all of this stuff. It goes back centuries and centuries before Jesus. And Josephus, the first century Jewish Roman historian, gives us abigilian details about this place in his big books, the Antiquities and the Jewish Wars. And I kind of want to read all of it to you, but I mean, it's a lot. Apparently, there was this big white marble temple that was somehow built into or built around or framed the springs and this cave of Pan. And apparently it was meant to honor Caesar, but the larger point is that this place was somehow commemorative of the headwaters of the Jordan that give life to all of the tribes of Israel as it flows south into the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. It's emblematic of the Hellenism of the past, that is the Greekification and the Greek God Pan who has mysterious origins, but is associated with playing the flute and getting hammered and sexy stuff and all of that. So I don't know what you exactly make of Pan, but he was lionized in this neck of the woods. It's also a place that was built up at great expense to honor the God man, whoever was sitting on the throne in Rome as the emperor of Rome. So this place like Philadelphia, see what I did there all the way back to the beginning, like Philadelphia is connected to a ton of different myths and metaphors and legends and stories and it could symbolize so many different things. And so what I want to try to figure out when we get back together for our next conversation is which one of these things was Jesus trying to draw on by being here or is he trying to draw on all of them or is he trying to draw on none of them. It just so happens that Matthew was like, I remember I'd never been to Caesarea Philippi before and that place was needed. Had that cool white temple and the cave of Pan and I see why everybody raves about it so much. It was really neat being up there. So just as a side note and a throwaway line, hey, we were in Caesarea Philippi. Anyway, here's this stuff that happens next. I'd like to sort through that as well as well moving into the answer to this gigantic question that Jesus asks, who do the people say the son of man is? As always, thank you for being willing to engage with me on all of this history, geography business. I wouldn't take our time on it if I didn't think it really helped to make more sense of the text and understand how the original audience understood it, how the original author intended it and in this situation, this location would have conjured stuff in the brains of the original audience. So we got to think about it a little bit to see if it provides any framework to go along with what is the most profound theological moment in all of the book of Matthew to date that's coming up here in just a couple of verses. And on that note, we're going to call it quits for today. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
