 everybody. It's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. And in my right hand, I have the Norton anthology of English literature, sixth edition volume one, Norton press. And in my left hand, I have a sheet of paper with some notes on it about some things that I probably needed to do, but did not get done. Huh, that's disappointing. This Norton anthology of English literature has 2,586 pages not counting the paperback cover on the front and back. And at this time, I'm going to try to rip it in half. Second here. Okay, that didn't work at all. At this time, I'm going to try to rip that little piece of note paper in half. Yep, worked really easy. As we discussed yesterday, how impressive it is to rip a thing in half has everything to do with how thick it is. So what was the deal with this curtain, this veil that tore when Jesus died in Matthew 27? If it's a decorative curtain that you could get from Walmart and this real cheap, I don't know, it's pretty cool that telekinetically that thing got torn, I guess. But if it's something real thick and heavy and impressive, and it has all kinds of meaning attached to it, dang, that's a bigger deal. And that's going to get people's attention more. But what is this curtain like? Those of you who have been around church for a long time, those of you who have not, let's speculate for a minute. What have you heard? What do you remember? If you're somebody who's never heard the sermon or a Bible study or a conversation about this passage ever, what would you guess knowing what you know about the temple? I mean, just to jog your memory from things that we've talked about here, back in Exodus, there's a description about building a mobile version of the temple, a predecessor to this temple. And the idea was you'd have some golden furniture and stuff in there and it does different things that symbolizes different things about God and his relationship with his chosen people. But then there's a set-apart side in there. And in that set-apart, most holy area of the temple that is set apart by a curtain, and in there, that's where God dwells among his people. So that's a pretty big deal. And it looks like that description of the temple in Exodus is sort of an echo of that time that Moses saw the glory of God. And it was so much that then when other people looked at Moses, they got rebound glory of God. And so he had to start wearing a veil, which speaks into Matthew 17 and the transfiguration that with Jesus there, Peter and James and John, they were able to be more in the presence of God without just melting. They were confused by it. They didn't know what to do with it. But with Jesus there, as the mediator, it was like that barrier between God and man was broken down, is bridged. Something changed there. So all these little theological undertones. But even if you've never heard anybody give some elaborate speech about all this stuff in a church setting, and even if you're just new to all of this, I think you can speculate that that curtain, I mean, it was probably pretty nice, right? I mean, at least had to be one of those blackout curtains for sleeping during the day that you can get at Walmart because you wouldn't want a gany little bit of the glory of God to be visible if it truly was an overwhelming thing in an old testament context. So I think we could speculate that it's probably pretty fancy. But what about those of you who've heard a sermon on Matthew 27? Do you remember any of the details that came with it? Because there's one that stands out to me that maybe you've heard that I've heard repeated oftentimes. And it's the suggestion that this curtain was like four inches thick. No joke, like thicker than most big heavy wooden church doors. Could that really be the case? And I thought you know, that could be one of those things that just gets repeated again and again from commentary to commentary. But nobody really knows why they say that anymore. And so it just gets said a lot. And maybe it's a teeny tiny bit embellishy, or at least even if it is true, just very, very unsourced. So I thought, all right, I'm gonna go dig around and see what I can find with this stuff. So we got a couple of references here. Oh, yeah, Exodus 26 33. I didn't know that I looked it up. I let somebody else tell me let's see what see what that one says. Now I'm gonna start in verse 31. It says, make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen with cherubim worked into it by a skilled craftsman. Well, I guess it would have to be a skilled craftsman. Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of a kachia, a kachia. I don't know how to say that word. I'm embarrassed. You can all just yell the correct answer at me. A kachia would overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases. Hang the curtain from the clasps and place the arc of the testimony behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the holy place from the most holy place. Okay. Well, that seems pretty direct when we get a description of some of the colors and stuff. I don't think that speaks necessarily to the thickness of it. But it's interesting. I got another reference here that somebody's given me. This is Exodus 38 18. Let's see what this one says. All the curtains around the courtyard were a finely twisted linen. The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver and the tops were overlaid with silver. So all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands. Ah, okay. So this is not the same curtain. We got two curtains here and there are two curtains dividing two different entrances. This is the one that gets you into the first part of the temple. That other curtain we were describing from the other part of Exodus. That gets you into the the holy of holies. And well, you can only go in there if you're a certain person performing priestly duties. The curtain for the entrance of the courtyard was a blue purple scarlet and finally twisted linen, the work of an embroidery. It was 20 qubits long. Dang. Okay. 20 qubits as a two to three ratio. So that's like 30 feet. Wow. And like the curtains of the courtyard, it was five qubits high. So does that come to like seven and a half feet, something like that with four posts in the bronze bases. Okay. So they're big and they're clearly, they'd be heavy and they'd be weighty at that size. But we still don't get a sense of the thickness, though we are starting to get a sense of the purpose and what it would look like to walk in there and see these curtains. Now bear in mind, in Exodus, we're looking at a description of two iterations ago of the temple from what we're dealing with in Matthew 27. The tabernacle was the portable temple that the Jewish people, the Hebrew people rather hauled around in the wilderness before they made it to the promised land and eventually Solomon built a lasting temple per a promise made to David in that Davidic covenant that we talk so much about. Then you'll recall that temple got destroyed in 586 BC by King Nebuchadnezzar of the Babylonians. Then you'll recall that the Babylonians got toppled by the Persians over the course of about 10 years between 539 and 529 BC. That is around the events of the book of Daniel. And then shortly after that, Cyrus II, Cyrus the Great of Persia was like, hey, you Jewish people, you can go back and rebuild your city and your temple. And so the second temple gets built after the reign of Cyrus, the great and into the reigns of Darius and Xerxes and his descendants and so on. So would this temple that we're talking about here look exactly the same? I don't know, it would have a lot of the same overtones, but surely it would have a lot of the same theological overtones. I think there'd be continuity there. The New Testament as well, particularly in the book of Hebrews, Hebrews eight and nine is a, it feels like a really natural theological follow up to what's happened in Matthew where the author of Hebrews, there's some debate as to who that guy was, or maybe that lady was. The author seems to be really spelling out how the temple and the priesthood and all of that is summed up in Jesus and how it all fits together with Jesus. And so in Hebrews nine, there's a reference to the curtains of the temple and what goes on in there. And the idea is that now Jesus is this great high priest who is the mediator between God and man. So the author of Hebrews would seem to be saying that the tearing of this temple is kind of having the same effect as Jesus being there when the glory of God shown at the transfiguration. Jesus is this mediator, this go between and access to God approaching the throne of God, the throne of grace with confidence is possible because Jesus is this great high priest who has fulfilled the role of the priesthood that per Jesus words in Matthew 23, the priesthood that was in existence at the time had completely failed that. So we got some stuff from the Bible that we've looked at about the curtain or curtains in the temple. And we can't look at those details without immediately catching their context, which indicates that this veil meant something. It demonstrates the logical necessary moral essential division between a deity who made everything and is essence and being in and of himself and never got anything wrong and finite humanity who dies relatively quickly and does get a lot of stuff wrong but also bears the image of God and therefore can get close but cannot obtain for themselves the righteousness of God, the purity of God, the holiness of God. So that temple curtain, it meant something and it didn't just mean something because they embroidered it up all pretty and it does sound very pretty. It kind of represents the problem, doesn't it? Of the whole Bible? And then think about the plot of the Bible. God and people are together. People pick stupid destructive stuff, choose to make themselves their own authority in one of the very first stories of the whole Bible, Adam and Eve, pick following themselves over obeying God and it sets in motion this gigantic problem where now they got to leave the garden and there's this separation between God and man and the big question is, is God going to solve the problem or will he just wash his hands of the whole thing and awesome, he decides to fix it. And so the whole story then is how is God going to redeem this logical impossibility? How does the perfect take something that's imperfect and make it perfect? Well, the imperfect can't make itself perfect. And so that solution is going to have to come from the perfect side of that relational equation. And that curtain in the temple is demonstrative of that divide that humans cannot cross. Now, could somebody have just walked through that curtain? I guess so. People did with varying degrees of risk to their well-being. Some people fiddled around with it and found out and the stories say that they died getting too close to the holiness of God. Other people messed around with it and lived to tell the story, though they did go on to die horrible grizzly deaths later. Like, for example, most notably, Nias Pompeii, Magnus, the great general and contemporary of Julius Caesar. But the point is the curtain means something. It symbolizes the human problem. Sin, death, failure, the bitter sweetness of life are separation from God. God, the source of essence, the source of meaning, the source of life, the master of time and rightness and purpose. You got this problem of sin and death that is in the way. And dang, that thing just tore in two. But you know what I still really want to know? How thick was it? Yeah, we can't help but get into the theology when we look at these passages. But I'm not done poking around at everything this means and all of the implications. So we'll pick it up and work more on this tomorrow. Hey, I noticed that a bunch of you went and listened to that bonus episode over the weekend. More people have listened to that than probably any bonus episode that we've ever done. So thank you for going and catching it. I know I asked that as a favor just because I want you to be up to speed with what we're doing here and you did. So thank you if you haven't caught it yet. I'd still be grateful if you caught two episodes ago, the bonus Saturday one where we just talk about what the plan is here moving forward. I have received more kind, excited, energizing feedback and comments and messages from you than I have over anything ever about what the plan is moving forward. So thanks for learning what the plan is. And for being excited about it with me, that means a ton. We'll keep going on this thing about a curtain which on the surface seems like it wouldn't matter very much. But the more we look at it, it seems like it really, really, really, really matters. We'll do that tomorrow. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
