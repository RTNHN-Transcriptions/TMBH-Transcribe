 Hey there and welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Matt is still down with the frog in his throat, so I'm Jeff and I'll be your substitute today. Feel free to make fun of my name. Some suggestions are Jeff Smelly Foot or Mr. Boogerstrom. I just watched a fascinating documentary on the theft of a bunch of art from the Isabela Gardner Museum out in Boston that happened back in 1990. And these two guys dressed up as police officers got led in and just spent a couple hours ransacking the place. And one of the main pieces of art that was stolen was this Rembrandt Seascape called the Storm on the Sea of Galilee. And to this day, no one knows whatever happened to all of those paintings that got stolen. They could be buried in someone's backyard. Some people think they went through the hands of the mafia and got transported all over the world. Maybe they got destroyed. It's kind of a sad thing and those paintings might be lost forever. But it made me think because on the wall in my office, I have the Storm on the Sea of Galilee print, not the actual one, as far as you know. And I look at it a lot and I love that painting, but I had this picture in my head of somebody walking in and seeing that painting on the wall and saying, wow, you have the new movie poster for the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Look at that. And I'd be like, well, actually, no, that's Jesus in the Apostles. No, that totally looks like Captain Jack Sparrow. No, that's by Rembrandt. He even painted himself in the picture. No, that totally looks like Johnny Depp. At some point, it becomes a ridiculous argument, right? Okay, that painting is from like the 1630s. There's no way there's any reference at all to what this hypothetical person thinks it might be. But we do this sometimes. We say, well, no, art is in the eye of the beholder and I bring my own interpretation to it. Well, no, it's literally called the Storm on the Sea of Galilee. It is a picture of that scene. Rembrandt knew what he was painting when he painted it and he intended to paint that, not something else. If it was the Jackson Pollock painting, sure, we could stand there with our arms folded and be like, I think that looks like a tennis racket. Oh, yeah, I think that part over there looks like Godzilla and we might both be right. But sometimes the artist or the author definitely intends what they intend. I read an article years ago where Sting, the musician, was talking to a fan who's like, thank you so much for writing every breath you take when you were with the police. We use it as the processional music for our wedding or we use it as the first dance at our reception and Sting's eyes get really big and he's like, you did what? That's not a love song, guys. That's a song about a stalker. It's pretty messed up that you would use it after your wedding. Well, it was a love song. It just meant so much to us. Like no, it's not a love song. Sting's like, I know what I wrote and I wrote what I wrote on purpose. Similarly, when we're studying Scripture, we don't bring our own interpretation to it when it's clear that the author, whoever we think is behind the writing of this book, seems to have a point they're trying to make. Every time we pull a particular verse out of context because we like what it says and how it makes us feel, it's kind of like misinterpreting what Rembrandt painted or what Sting wrote. We just say, no, no, we think that means this for us for today and that is so dangerous. That's one of the things that I love about this podcast. I'm a fan as well as a substitute because if you're here and you're part of this conversation, it means you want to go through this document one verse at a time and let it say what it says. And so many of these verses that we've covered already in the book of Matthew are some of those that get pulled out of context like, judge not or you will be judged or where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am also. Some of these very famous, very popular verses that get pulled out of their context and then we make them mean what Matthew didn't intend them to mean. Now there's some things in Scripture that aren't very clear, that are hinted at here there that people have been debating for centuries and those are, I think, good debates because it could have been clearer, but it isn't. And we run into some of those verses in Matthew like, on this rock I will build my church and what you buy non-earth will be bound in heaven, things like that, that are still totally up for debate. But if we ever struggle to see if it's clear or unclear, we need to remember what the context is historically, what the audience would have heard, as well as how it's arranged. Matthew arranged these stories on purpose and why am I telling you all this? Well, we just got to the end of chapter 19 and before we get into the parable in chapter 20, I want to just take us back to chapters 18 and 19 and do a little recap of context. If you look at chapter 18 verse 1, which was covered a couple weeks ago, maybe even a couple months ago by now, it says this, at that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? That's the question that drives all the discourse in chapter 18 and it drives a lot of the conversations in chapter 19 and it ends in chapter 19 with this very last verse, but many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first. So think about that. Who will be the greatest in the kingdom and many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first? It sure sounds to me like those two verses are connected and if they are, that means everything between those two verses is contextually acting to flesh out these ideas. So what are the main themes here in chapter 18 and 19? Well, the main themes are access into the kingdom. Can rich people do it? What happens if you're divorced? What happens if your eye causes you to sin and keeps you out? Those types of questions are in this passage. Also things like how to treat people within the kingdom, like forgiving multiple and multiple times and not forgetting the tremendous debt we were forgiven by God in how we treat other people. There's also this contrast between the impossibility of entering the kingdom without God making it happen, but it's also in chapter 18 the search for the law sheep and that God doesn't want any of the little ones to perish. And speaking of little ones, twice in this section, kids come up. This whole thing starts with Jesus bringing a child in front of everyone and saying that unless you become like these little children, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And then later on, he says, don't stop the kids coming. Don't hinder them because the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these. So all of these stories are being woven together for Matthew to make a thematic point to us. And what is that point? What do you think it is? I think the point he's trying to make as I go through this exercise is that the kingdom of God isn't what we expect it's going to be. It isn't what the disciples expect it's going to be. It isn't what the Pharisees expect it's going to be. It's kind of upside down. Like to get into it, you have to not worry about yourself. You have to not be burdened by the things of this world. You have to be willing to walk away from those things. You have to receive the grace of God. I think that's the subtext of all of this. And it's certainly going to come out in chapter 20. I don't want to steal Matt's thunder, but we're heading into this great parable about the grace of God. And there's so much in here about it's impossible to be in the kingdom unless God makes it happen. But there's also stuff in here that says God doesn't want anyone to perish. God wants to make it happen. The whole thing I think Jesus is trying to say is I'm here because the Father wants this to happen. And here are the things that are going to make it hard for you. So let them go. Come as a child. Stop worrying about all the ways to judge yourself versus other people. Stop worrying about all the stuff that you have that you think gets you somewhere with God. The Father isn't interested in any of that. He sees you as a sheep that's gone astray and he wants to bring you back. I think those are some of the thematic elements in this passage which sets us up for a great teaching on grace. But you can't get to grace until you've gone through some of these exercises. So if we just start pulling versus out of context, oh, this is what Jesus says about divorce. There we go. Let's write a book about it. Without the context of what else is going on in chapter 18 and chapter 19, we can miss a lot. And just like Rem Brant or Sting or pretty much any other writer or artist, half of these put these things together so that we'll pick up on some of these threats. And so that's what I just wanted to do is kind of a recap for today. Thanks so much for your ongoing support of this podcast. Matt will hopefully be back next time to take us into chapter 20 and beyond. Thank you also for your support of me as a fill in. Until next time, I'm Jeff and thank you for listening to the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
