 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Have you heard the song Pompeii by Bastille? I feel like we've maybe talked about this before, but we've been doing this for a long time. So we've probably talked about just about everything before. It's a really good song. So I don't mind bringing it up again if we have talked about it before. Obviously, it's about the city. They got destroyed in 79 AD and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and there are various interpretations as to what exactly the lyrics mean. But they seem pretty specific to the events of Pompeii. It's definitely meant to be a metaphor as somebody is reflecting on their life, or maybe some people think reflecting on their relationships now. But the destruction and the ruin of Pompeii is right there. Let me read you a couple of the lyrics here real quick. I was left to my own devices many days, fell away with nothing to show, and the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love. Great clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above. But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all? And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you've been here before? How am I going to be an optimist about this? How am I going to be an optimist about this? And he goes on, we were caught up and lost in all of our vices in your pose as the dust settles around us. That might be in repose. I think that's actually what the lyric is supposed to be there. And there's a chorus and stuff in another bridge here that's pretty cool. It says, oh, where do we begin the rubble or our sins? Oh, where do we begin the rubble or our sins? And like I said a second ago, lots of people read this as somebody looking at their life and be like, ah, why is it more coming to this? Other people read it as a relationship thing. But there's another way to read this. And that is in light of the fact that this wasn't the first time Vesuvius had erupted. This has been going on for a long time. And there was even a meaningful eruption comfortably within living memory by the time that the grand eruption that took Pompey in 79 AD occurred. In fact, Pompey and at least some of the surrounding buildings and cities had had to have been rebuilt after that destruction at times. So the people there knew what it was to have this wreckage come down hard upon them with very little warning and they stayed put. And maybe the song with that line about sifting through the rubble or our sins is about that not learning from mistakes, not learning from reading the signs before. Likewise, Jesus is stressing this theme very heavily throughout the Olivet Discourse, the fifth of the five big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured that we're in right now in Matthew chapter 24. He's stressing this theme of being ready, being prepared and having just enough of the broad strokes and impressions of how history will unfold to have a sense that history is moving toward a place guided by God where it will eventually be ripe, pregnant, ready to go for the return of the Son of Man, for the unfolding of the things that will represent the end of the age to use the language that the disciples chose to ask Jesus about how history would ultimately wrap up and unfold. And for the last few days, we've been looking at verse 36 and we're going to move all the way up to verse 39, which stresses even harder that this day when the Son of Man returns is going to be big, it's going to be significant, the world is going to shake dramatically, things are going to shake out dramatically. And there might not be a ton of warning in the immediate moment. Even if there is, this passage suggests that most people are going to miss it. Here's what Jesus says starting verse 36, nobody knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven nor the Son, but only the Father. We talked about that a bunch over the last few days that however this works within the Trinity, the Bible is holding out the idea that God knows, but Jesus doesn't. Jesus reiterates his point and I guess it would be Acts 1, 7. I think he says it right before famous verse and 8 about being his witnesses to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria at the ends of the earth. I don't write that one down in ink, but it's roughly right around there somewhere. But then moving forward, I think the really obvious next question for the disciples or for the original reader or the reader now is just, okay, that was a lot. Can you just take me back to what the basic point of all of this was though? Because you didn't give me enough to be like, all right, here's exactly how history is going to unfold. And now I know all the details have a calendar with a red circle on a date and I got everything solved. So why did you tell me any of this and what exactly is the point again? And if we go back and we read everything Jesus has said up to this point, it's pretty obvious that the main point is readiness. Is some stuff is going to happen? Some stuff beyond your control. History is going somewhere. God is master of history. There will be a return. There will be a reckoning and your job is not to imagine that you can somehow get your hands on the levers of historical power and make all of these things come to pass or unfold a certain way or speed up the timeline that God in heaven has ordained the role of the kingdom citizen like the disciples who were asking Jesus about this and that suits being talked to and given the answer by Jesus here, the role of the kingdom citizen is readiness and faithfulness. Taking a life of kingdom values, doing kingdom valuable things, trading in the currency of the kingdom in anticipation and hope that this thing isn't over because heaven and earth will pass away, but Jesus words will never pass away. He just got done saying that in verse 35. He says that in 35 then in 36, he says, nobody knows the day or the hour. Then the question is still lingering. They're like, wait, can you boil it down again? Like, what's the point? And for that we get this analogy as it was in the days of Noah. So it'll be at the coming of the son of man. All right. So we're getting somewhere. Now we're bringing up the name Noah. That's one of those stories that everybody knows is Genesis six, Genesis seven, the world was messed up. The text and Genesis and extra biblical traditions from around the time of Jesus are certainly leveling this accusation that there was a hubris. There was a pride, the same attitude that led to the building of the tower of Babel. That's all there. There's something wrong and broken with humanity all the way to the core. That's one of the big themes of Genesis. And part of that brokenness is shortsightedness, just not seeing the big picture, living as if there is no God, living as if there is no point to any of this other than get more stuff, accumulate things, feel good, world kingdom values. And so when Jesus says when the son of man returns, it's going to be like it was in the days of Noah. Well, here's exactly how it's going to be like those days from the days before the flood in the days of Noah. Before eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage up to the day, Noah entered the ark. In other words, back then, the normal person, they'd seen the rumblings. They'd seen the smoke coming out of metaphorical Vesuvius. They'd maybe even seen that thing blow its top a few times. They'd maybe even had a few things wrecked by it. But there was this perspective that just said, you know, we just, we keep doing things and we live with world kingdom perspective, world kingdom values and the text holds it out as though that was something that was really destructive and problematic. And people imagining, I'm going to live forever. Just keep doing what they're doing. But then the day came where all these folks were eating and drinking and partying and being given and marriage and giving and marriage, all of which I think are absolutely nice and good things to do. But the day came where all of those folks who had also sneered at this ark and sneered at the idea that God might have in store for them any kind of correction or reckoning, all of a sudden, water start coming up and the water start coming down and fully acknowledging that some Christians in history read early Genesis as being more metaphorical and not literally specific while others read it as being absolutely literally specific and the details are historical in nature. One place where both of those different interpretive crowds can agree is that Jesus invoking this story is pointing back to the inarguable biblical theological point that humans have a sin problem. There's something destructive and damaged and lacking in perspective and again, to use the Bible terms sinful about humanity and that God was making a correction happen in the story of Noah. So in that moment, the thing that would have seemed really natural was more of the same than drinking and eating and partying and marrying and being given and marriage. Like that'd be the thing that you'd expect to keep going forever because it's what everybody does all the time. And the weirdo, the outlier, like there's no future for that. That seems weird and like nothing's going to happen there. But then it's all flipped on its head. And it turns out the God thing was real all along and what seems like this just immutable, unchangeable forever and ever just way that things are. It turns out it wasn't as immutable and unchangeable and permanent as everybody thought it was as metaphorical, Vesuvius blew its top and metaphorically melted the town and encased it in medicine metaphorical liquid hot magma and the magma cloud and pyroclastic black cloud death that killed everybody. It's possible I linguistically stretch that metaphor just a little too far. But here's another interesting thing about that is if you go back and look at chapter six and seven, Noah and his family didn't know the exact day or hour that the flood was going to happen either. He got some notice about a week out and then stuff started happening like right after that last little bit of notice and then it's just on. And nobody was really ready except well, Noah had broad stroke sense of what the timeline was and he had been faithful and been steady and was prepared. And as a result, his experience with the flood was very, very different than the other people in the story. I know that any time we talk about the flood, it raises all kinds of very big picture character of God, moral judgment questions. We tackled some of that in previous conversations. We will tackle some of that in future conversations. But for the time being, I want to try to just read this through the lenses of the original audience who would have encountered this and said, oh, yeah, yeah, that is the story. And we all agree with the story there that the people who got it were the ones who got on the boat and the people who didn't get it were the ones who thought that the way their lives were, it's the way their lives were going to be forever. And they just weren't ready. And there's a metaphor from Noah there as well as there is from Pompeii about readiness and learning something and paying attention to the signs and what's going on around you. So the suggestion that in invoking this from Jesus to his disciples is, hey, you guys have got what you need now to know how to get onto the metaphorical boat. And then it wraps up like this in the final verse of this little thought. And then you know nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. And then here's a little football spike to just round it out in case you didn't already get it. This is how it will be at the coming of the son of man. So this we're going to get a bunch of word pictures for the next several anecdotes. And I think all of those word pictures reflect back on this principle about the days of Noah that we just heard as well as the whole thing, all of 24 that we just looked at with this general description of how things are going to work their way toward an end of things and that the kingdom citizens role in all of this is faithfulness and readiness. More on that next time around. I'm Matt is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
