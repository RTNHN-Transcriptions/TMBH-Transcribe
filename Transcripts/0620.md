 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. A couple weeks ago, we worked through all of the academic side of the parable of the talents in Matthew 25. And over the last few days, we've been working this through from a different angle. That is the more personal side, like the implication. Like, just what do we do with this for us? Because it's a very challenging story. It's very challenging teaching with a lot of implications. We've been wrestling through the question of like, what if there was another hypothetical servant who believed everything right and cared about everything and was vested the right way and his investments didn't work out or another servant who felt all the same way and tried super hard, but had to report to the master that she lost everything trying to get it right. How would the master respond based on what we read in the rest of the New Testament, based on what we read in the rest of Matthew? And what does that mean for us? We're thinking about where we fit into the kingdom and where we fit as sons, daughters, heirs, potential agents of this kingdom. So that's what we've been grappling through. That's what I've been thinking through. And we're just going to pick up where we left off yesterday and continue on after Jeff plays a little bit of music. The expectation of the master, the expectation of the king, established throughout the book of Matthew, is that everybody who becomes a kingdom citizen, everybody who's a part of this thing would one, bend the knee to the king, our father in heaven, how would be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth is in heaven. Give us a daily bread, forgive us your debts. We also forgive our debtors and lead us on an temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. That is that oath of loyalty, of submission to a king. It's an oath of fealty. And that I believe in Matthew six in the middle of the sermon on the mountain. That is your signup speech. That is the thing where if you can say that and maybe even imperfectly, what you're saying is this goes against every impulse I have, I want to be my own king, but I defer to you because you're the one true king. I want to have my own kingdom values, but your kingdom values are better. I defer to those. I want to build my own thing, but my thing won't last and it will be corrupt. Your thing will be awesome. So I'm going to go with that. I want my own justice, but my justice is broken and biased. Your justice is good. I want to provide for myself. I'm a man of the West. I can handle my own business, but I can't and I can't actually sustain that. I have to depend on your provision. So what we're seeing throughout the book of Matthew is this idea that the kingdom citizen is oriented to God is oriented to the king as a servant who has taken an oath of submission and fealty. That means that you are on board with whatever the agenda of the king is and your efforts and your energies are enlisted unendingly in the service of that king and his agenda. And we learn a little bit more about what the agenda is, at least for the time being here at the end of Matthew chapter nine, where it says, Jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd, like a kid coming back from blowing his dad's fortune and being an idiot and asking to be received back in any way, kind of like that. That last part's my paraphrase. Then he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. And in the very next sentence, you start Matthew chapter 10. And that is all about Jesus sending them out in a very imperfect state, vested with certain things like, Hey, you got this message, he even sends him out with like miraculous power. It's hard to know what to make of that. But it says that he does that they can like heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse people with leprosy, drive out demons, freely you've received freely give. That sounds a lot like parable of the talents language. He sends them out as kingdom citizens who've bent the knee to him who understand what he wants them to accomplish. He sends them out well equipped, not with swords or bags, money or a bunch of copper, a bunch of gold or anything like that. He just sends them out equipped with those kingdom values that kingdom authority. He's like, I go tell people. And then he tells them, sometimes it's going to work and sometimes it's going to not. Ah, it sounds then like the big picture here is what the king wants is for in the style of the Lord's prayer for the kingdom citizen to bend the knee. Then it sounds like what the king wants is for the kingdom citizen to attentively listen to the agenda of the king for his kingdom. And for the kingdom citizen to then be like, I'm on board with that. I'm going to find a role and I'm going to play a part in accomplishing the thing you said you wanted to get done. And then it sounds like the next thing that happens is that the king vest those kingdom citizens with a certain investment. And it's about to do things that advance the household, the kingdom, the whole grand redemptive project, all of it. And then after that, it sounds like the king even anticipates that sometimes that's totally going to work out and see it's going to land on that soil it's going to take. And other times it's not going to work out. See, it's going to land on that soil. It's not going to take the seed is good. This isn't always going to take. That's how the kingdom is. And so it's okay. So built into everything else we've already seen in Matthew built into Luke, built into Ephesians two is the answer to our completely reasonable question regarding what happens if somebody is vested and takes a big swing as a kingdom citizen. And it doesn't work out with the kind of results that we see in this one particular example in Matthew chapter 25. And frankly, I like the way the big picture looks. I like the way the program looks. I like this order of operations. And I like what we see on display about the expectations and the character of the master. It looks like the only thing that's precluded here explicitly in Matthew 25 and the rest of Matthew in general is the person who comes along and acts like the couple at the beginning of idiocracy. Do you ever see that show? I don't recommend it or any show. I'm not going to explain the whole scenario to you, but there's this couple at the beginning who probably would have been great parents, but they just keep on not having kids because, yeah, the economy, what with the new job? Well, with the move, there's always a reason that they don't. And that's part of the punchline and the plot of the whole story. But likewise, this seems like the one thing that is just precluded in the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 25 and throughout the book of Matthew is the one who's like, oh, man, I just, I really could not do kingdom stuff right now. Like just look at how earth was God. I mean, people were being mean. Politics were stupid. Look at how the economy was. We had a pandemic for a couple of years in there. Like you can't, it just wasn't the time to, you know, just you know how people are. And you know how like church was and culture was. I'm sorry. I just, here's your investment in me back. I thought it best to do nothing because of how you are. It is pretty clear that is the one action on the part of the servant that just doesn't work. It doesn't make sense. You can't square it with kingdom values. And I suppose somebody could debate like, oh, well, does that person actually like a member of the household of the king? Or was that person never really in? I don't know. I suppose that's maybe a conversation for another day. And of course, based on what we saw in Ephesians two and Luke 15 and other places, like, oh, I don't know. I suppose the master can even forgive that if he wants to, because he knows all the circumstances and his judgments are always right. The bottom line is this, on the one hand, we got to think about the parable of the talents in light of its immediate context and the failure of the Jewish religious leadership to do the things that they were supposed to do. That is all in the background here. And this is all very much meant to be an orientation instruction for a right contrasting mindset for Jesus disciples, for kingdom citizens. But on the larger, more existential, just big picture of what it is to be a kingdom citizen and live in this kingdom kind of stuff, it seems pretty straightforward that there's an opportunity that comes with this bestedness to take big swings and be a part of the truest, realist thing in a way that is giganticly meaningful. And if it goes awesome, awesome. And if not every single thing works out, well, that seems almost anticipated by the rest of Jesus teachings in Matthew. And there's patience and forgiveness and long sufferingness for that. At times, I'm concerned that I've read this parable with a little bit of shortsightedness and maybe almost read it through the lenses of one parable guy. But I think the better way to read it is in that immediate context that we talked about, but also in light of the character, the master that we've also been discussing that's on display throughout the rest of the document. Do you guys remember when I was like, Oh, we're just going to take today and we're just going to finish this thing up? I think that was like a week ago, but I needed to process this out. This was important to me. I did this all in one setting. I don't know if you all can tell when I'm doing this or not. Usually these kind of multi episodes spread out there. They're all they're all one time sitting here at the mic and I just add in a little break afterwards. And that was the case this time too. I wanted to game this out with you, not write out a big long speech and just read it at you. I wanted to think about this like a person who's actually thinking about it and actually trying to figure out where I fit and what I'm doing with it too, because this whole exercise that we are doing together, like I haven't solved this. It's not like I went and wrote the whole thing out. And then I got a microphone and over the course of a couple of years just gradually recited to you what I'd already written. Like, it's I'm feeling it out too. That's the whole idea. And this is the beauty of the arrangement that we have here is that you get to work through this thing with somebody who's actually working on it also. So thanks for engaging with the text in a little different way this week than maybe we normally do. And now we are on to the final part of Jesus remarks in Matthew chapter 24 and 25 next time around. Again, I got to say thank you real quick to the handful of people who over the last few days decided to help support this thing and make it go at patreon.com slash the Tmbh podcast. Some of that was pretty humbling that came in there and super helpful. And I don't I always feel fumbling and weird when I try to say thank you. I'm just trying to be a normal natural human being, but I don't know what to do with my hands because it's it's just really generous of you. And thank you for helping to make this thing happen. It means a lot. I appreciate you. All right, on to the next stuff manana. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
