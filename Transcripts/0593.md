 Hey my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we have got miles to go before we sleep. We got stuff to do today. So we're just gonna pick up right where we left off yesterday in the middle of a big picture overview of the first 24 chapters of Matthew. So we can keep this thing spread out in front of us and really try to understand the whole book at once. I'm gonna have my friend Jeffrey, who does the music here, play a little something, and then we're gonna pick up where we left off yesterday. ["The New Year's Day"] In chapter 19, Jesus has another back and forth with the Pharisees. This time it's about divorce and remarriage. And then he has a conversation famously with a rich young ruler who's like, how do I get eternal life? And Jesus is like, obey all these commands. And he's like, oh yeah, I totally have. And I don't know about that, but that's what the kid said. And Jesus is like, cool, all right, well, if you wanna be perfect, go sell all your stuff and give it to the poor. And the rich young ruler is exposed as loving world kingdom currency, more than kingdom kingdom currency. And he's not willing to do it. He goes away proud. And that's where you get that famous quote about harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than it is to cram a camel through the eye of the needle mild paraphrases mind. Then we get to chapter 20. And now the whole story is pivoting into act three. And Jesus is headed toward Jerusalem, which is way down south from where most of this story has occurred, like think Milwaukee, Wisconsin, down to Chicago, Illinois kind of distance. And so he makes the trip along the way. He heals people. He talks about humility as being a value of the kingdom. And then in chapter 21, he gets to the town where he's gonna meet his fate, the big great grand city of Jerusalem where the official important things happen. And he sends his disciples in ahead of him to get a donkey instead of riding in on a war horse. He's gonna ride in a donkey. I think that's symbolic. I think that means something. But he goes in and surprise, the town is ready for him to be there. They welcome their king. They get out branches and they wave him around. And they say, to the son of David, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest. And you think Jesus would be like, yeah, right on, I'm gonna ride this wave of popularity for a while. Nope. Instead he goes right to the most holy building in all of this religion, maybe in the whole world at this point or ever. And he goes in and he sees that there's a whole bunch of buying and selling and weird bastardizations of the temple sacrificial system. And he's like, no, no, no, no, not in my father's house. And he starts flipping the merchants tables over and yelling, my house will be called a house of prayer. But you're making it a den of robbers. And you would think that he just blew it. Like now everybody's gonna be mad and they're like, oh, weird, you're weird and unhinged. We didn't like the table flipping. We liked the donkey riding, not the table flipping, but it's not what happened. Everybody's like, oh yeah, that's what the king is gonna look like. This guy could be the real deal and they bring their sick and their lame and they all get healed and Jesus teaches and this is getting way too hyped up for the Pharisees taste. And then a bunch of kids start yelling, Hosanna to the son of David, which is a title that kind of means that great king who was prophesied from long ago who's gonna show up and sit on the throne forever. And the Pharisees just absolutely will not have that. And they're like, make them stop. Jesus told the kids to stop. But Jesus was like, I don't know, maybe they're telling the truth, huh? I mean, from the lips of babes, I think that's where we actually get that saying. And then he goes and stays at a friend's house a little bit outside of Jerusalem proper that night. And then on his way back into town, there's this goofy little visual image, this visual parable where he has an encounter with a fig tree that isn't producing any figs and he curses it and is like, hey, you're supposed to bear fruit. And if it's not bearing fruit, like what's actually the point of this thing's existence? And you figure out pretty quickly, oh, it's a metaphor for what's going on religiously, for what's happening with his opponents and for this system that's been built, that's built on hypocrisy and falsehood and that is supposed to draw people closer to God in the kingdom, but that instead is driving a wedge between people and God and the kingdom. And so he comes into town, the Pharisees are all over him, asking him questions, getting after him about things, they question his authority, but dude is just so smart. I don't have time to break it all down because it is a summary, but wow, his capacity to parry these verbal attacks in the moment so quickly and to really shame his opponents in front of everyone. It is remarkable. And so the religious leaders come right at him first thing in the morning. Jesus handles that according to Matthew 21 and then he goes on the offensive with these parables. And he tells a couple of stories where the religious leadership are obviously the butt of the joke, they come out looking terrible and he's like, okay, so what do you think's gonna happen here? And they have to be grudgingly admit in front of everybody like, yeah, the people who got all the things wrong, they're gonna be in trouble. And Jesus is like, yep, that's exactly what's gonna happen here. It's common sense, gigantic paraphrase is mine, but after Jesus gets unsan, all this stuff, the religious leaders are super furious. They're embarrassed. They wanna kill him, but the crowd loves him at this point. So there's really nothing they can do. Then in chapter 22, the religious leaders, I think all of this is happening in and around the temple courtyard area, this is all happening very publicly. The religious leaders come back at Jesus with a bunch of theological quizzes that they think are just absolute clinchers, but Jesus handles them all easily and then goes above and beyond. He goes right back to them and pleads with them doing some of his own rabbinical reasoning. Like think about what the scriptures say and what it's gonna look like when the Christ shows up, do the math on it, guys, come on. And even though that looks like they're able to do the math on it, like they just can't. They've painted themselves into a corner. And so at the end of 22, that's the moment where I think in this story, the die is cast, the Rubicon is crossed. This is the point of no return. This thing is headed for bloodshed. And I think Jesus senses the same thing because in chapter 23, he just unloads. And maybe 23 should be counted as one of the big speeches around which Matthew is structured because it's all Jesus saying what is wrong with the current religious system and the intellectual religious tradition that the current Pharisees and Sadducees are a part of. And then he gets to the end of chapter 23 and Jesus expresses regret. He says, ah, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who killed the prophets and stoned those who sent you. How often I've longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers your chicks under your wings, but you weren't willing. Look, your house has left you desolate for I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. And that takes us to chapter 24, which is where we're at right now. We're in Jerusalem, we're around the temple, the die has been cast. It's only a matter of time until Jesus gets arrested. Jesus walks away from the temple out to this little mountain hillside across the way from the temple. He's talking to his disciples and they're like, it seems like you're saying everything's gonna get like taken apart and that you're gonna die. And how's this all gonna work? You're coming back, right? What's gonna be the signs of all of that? How will we know when that's gonna happen? What are we supposed to do? And so Jesus gives a somewhat intentionally vague, but also mildly detailed account of how history is going to unfold. And then ultimately he affirms, hey, when the son of man, that's his favorite term for himself, comes back, you're not gonna miss it. It's gonna be super, super, super evident. And Christians throughout history of red, this kind of language in the Bible, a little bit differently one way or another, but what's in arguable is that he gives them some things that point to an unfolding future thing that's going to happen in history. And he indicates that he is coming back and things will get sorted out in the right way. And that's where we're at. Now you're up to speed. You can see, right? All of the seven or however many you wanna imagine, there are plots that have permeated all of human storytelling for all of history, they're all in there. This thing is rich. And at the pace we just went, I can't give you all the symbolism and little connections and connections to history. There's so much going on here and it's so good. And we're not even to the fully juicy part yet. We're coming up next on the most climactic events in the story and I can't wait to unpack it. So, hey, the further we get into this thing, the longer it takes to recap it, thanks for doing this over the course of a couple of days here with me. Hopefully every time we do that, it is helping just a little bit more. One, for those of you who are new to feel more comfortable and caught up on the story. But two, for those of you who've been with it through the whole thing to resumment your understanding of the structure of the story. And hopefully every time we go through it in broad strokes like this, you're making a few more connections that can only be made by jumping back and forth. Once you have all of the raw materials of that whole story spread out on the desktop in front of you so you can look at it all at once. I'm so excited about this. I don't know what other format we can do this in where we can accomplish the goals that we have set out before us and I'm super pumped to get into the stuff that happens next. All right, back to Matthew chapter 24. Next time around, thanks for doing this with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. ["Pomp and Circumstance"]
