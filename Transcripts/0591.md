 Hey, my friends, it's Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and real quick here on the front end, I want to say welcome to a whole bunch of new people who jumped in and started participating in the podcast here over the weekend. It's really cool that you're here. I don't know who you are yet. It's just that I own a computer and it tells me a lot of numbers about things, and I can tell that a lot of you are trying this out. Probably this is your first episode, like day of episode that you've encountered. And so that's exciting for me. Thank you for being here. If you are anything like all of the people who already listened to this, it means that you're probably a lot different from me because this is a pretty diverse group of people where the objective is not ultimately for me to duplicate myself and every opinion I've ever had in every single person who listens, rather the objective is hang out with people who might not see the world the exact same way, but who acknowledge that there's something pretty special about the Bible and who would like to understand one book of the Bible for starters, really, really, really, really, really well. And so we're putting a lot of energy into historical context and literary context and stuff like that. And also from time to time, we hit pause points and do a quick reset overview of everything we've covered so far because each time we do that reset, theoretically, it gets us that much more familiar and comfortable with the structure of the story and what's going on in the book of Matthew. So when we talk about story structure in general, it has been argued by smart people most recently. There was a book that is just a massive work that came out in like 2004, 2005 by a guy named Christopher Booker called the seven basic plots and it has a subtitle and I don't remember the subtitle. And in this work, Booker argues that you got seven plots that pretty much every story ever fits into. And it's a pretty fun exercise to sit around and be like, wait, no, okay, tell me what they are. And then I'm going to try to think of something that don't fit. Generally speaking, if they don't fit, they weren't very good. The seven plots are overcoming the monster rebirth, tragedy, voyage in return, comedy, the quest and rags to riches. And I don't have time to get into all of the details, but you're smart. You know what words mean. You can kind of do the math on what all of those story types are and you can kind of plug in different movies and books and things that you've encountered along the way. And I don't know if he's right or not, but it's an interesting swipe and I at least have to think real hard about why he's wrong. If he is wrong, those stories have resonated across time and across culture. Why? Because I think they are reflective of existence. They're reflective of reality as we and pretty much all humans ever have understood it. One of the things that I think is so amazing about the book of Matthew though, is that it isn't one of those. It's kind of all of those. I mean, if you've never run through it before, it kind of feel bad spoiling it for you. But rebirth, it comes up in the book of Matthew tragedy. Yep, that's in there. Comedy. There's so much funnier stuff in there than the Bible ever gets credit for. It's a delightfully funny, ironic book at times. Voyage in return. Yeah, we get several of those literally and metaphorically. The quest. Heck yeah. Rags to riches. This isn't just like the pretty woman archetype where you go from being real poor to getting rich, but where you go from struggling and being on the outside of the thing to overcoming and being victorious and ascendant in a thing. Sometimes rags to riches is rags to riches to rags again. By the way, that was kind of interesting considering the way the book of Matthew plays out and then overcoming the monster. That's all over the book of Matthew and not just in a literal sense, like there are physical bad guys who want to kill Jesus, but in a spiritual metaphorical sense, sin, evil, death, stuff that the Bible holds out is affecting everyone and affecting everyone in ultimately a lethal way. The book of Matthew is suggesting that Jesus defeats all of that stuff in the end as well as defeating the spiritual reality of evil manifest in Satan. So in the same way that Colombo at the beginning of the princess bride is like this book has all the things that you like sword fighting, French kissing, boat chases, punching eels. And he's presenting that as like a selling point to the kid. It's like it's got all the stories. All the stories are in it. So likewise, Matthew, I think can rightly be described as having all of the stories that we find familiar as well. Here's the super quick overview of where we're at. When Jesus shows up at the beginning of the book of Matthew and he's probably born a couple of years before the BC AD flip, we've got a religious and political situation that's been ongoing for centuries. The Jewish people have tried to rebuild a kingdom under the leadership of the Persians hundreds of years before Christ, but there have been interlopers Alexander the Great, the Romans, some Greek generals, they come along. There's all kinds of problems for them and they feel like they haven't heard prophetically from their unique God, the God of Abraham for hundreds of years. And so there's this malaise when Jesus shows up on the scene as a little baby. And by the time Matthew, who was a follower of Jesus gets around to writing down what he wanted to write down regarding the life of Jesus, there are a lot of dots that people are ready to connect between the Old Testament, super ancient Jewish stuff and what went on in the life of Jesus. So in Matthew chapter one, there's a huge genealogy, a whole bunch of names might be a little overwhelming, but they all would have reminded the original audience of this very lengthy story of the relationship between the God who made all things and his chosen people, the Jews, and it would have reminded them this genealogy of Jesus. Also of this promise that there is this great king who is supposed to come one day and establish this kingdom and God will reign and amazing things will happen and injustices will be sorted out. And so Matthew opens by raising the question, could that be Jesus? Is he the Christ, the promised Messiah? Then you get all the Christmas time stuff in chapter one and chapter two, Jesus evades being slaughtered by Herod the Great, Herod the Great dies. Jesus grows up in the second part of chapter two. In chapter three, his cousin, John the Baptist is out in the desert somewhere. There's a lot of debate about exactly where that was, but somewhere there was water at least he's baptizing people. There's this massive religious revival that's happening and people are going out there. And John the Baptist has a run in with the religious leaders of the day, the people who everyone should be turning to, but for some reason they're coming out into John, they don't like it. And John calls out their motives and says, repent for the kingdom of heaven as at hand. Then Jesus, John's cousin, shows up. He's like, hey, baptize me too. And we know from the rest of the text that John's like, I don't know, like you're Jesus, you're the one who was to come. I don't know if I should do it. He's just like, yeah, we're doing this. It's right and proper, fulfill this for all righteousness. And so John baptizes him. And then the whole Trinity shows up. God, the father, the Holy Spirit comes down like a dove and this voice from heaven, I think is probably God, the father says, this is my son who my love with him. I am well pleased right after that. Jesus goes out in the desert in chapter four to be tempted by quoting a whole bunch of Bible. Jesus fends off the attacks and temptation of the devil. Then Jesus comes back. His reputation starts to build in the second half of chapter four. He recruits a bunch of disciples, people you've heard of Peter and so forth. Then in chapter five, we get the first of the big five speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured. The first one is called the Sermon on the Mount. And this is where you get all the blessed are this, blessed are the meek for the Ellen Herith the earth. The golden rule is in here. The Lord's prayer is in here. And in general, what he seems to be saying is that he is king of a kingdom and that this kingdom that he is bringing is the fulfillment of everything that happened in the Old Testament. And it is the truest, realist, bestest thing. And everybody should want to be in it. But he indicates without ever coming right out and saying it, the path that the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the religious leaders of the day are offering you does not get you into this kingdom. And everybody's super impressed. They're like, that was legit. He has actual authority. And from there on out, crowds are following him almost all the time. He comes down the mountain there in the Sea of Galilee, Northern modern day Israel. And he starts doing miracles left and right throughout chapter eight. Heals an unclean person that was a huge cultural taboo, but he did it anyway. He does a miracle by distance for a Gentile, a Roman occupying soldier. That's a gigantic deal. Apparently he can cast out demons, control the weather and people are freaked out by it, but also intrigued by it through the end of chapter eight and chapter nine. But toward the end of chapter nine, we see that the religious leaders are starting to get very agitated. They're sending people up from Jerusalem who are experts in the religion of the day and then like, no, we don't like this decentralized follow you values of the kingdom thing. That's horrible for what we're doing. And we're going to start probing the fences to find weaknesses that we can deal with this and maybe deal with you. Then in chapter 10, Jesus is like, I don't care how mad you are. I am going to take these people who get it and see the kingdom for what it is. I'm going to send them out with the same message John the Baptist had back in chapter three, repent for the kingdom of God is at hand. And on that note, look, here's the reality of it. This is a big book and it takes longer to recap it every single time we do this. So we're going to have to divide this up into a couple of parts to make sure that we get it all in so that we're properly reset and all ready to move forward together. Hey, once again, those of you who are brand new to this thing and just jumped in with the podcast here, thank you for doing that. I am so glad that you're here. I'm so glad that you're up for the conversation. I hope you just love it and I hope it's something we get to do together for a very long time. Okay, there. Now I'm actually done. My name's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. Oh, yeah.
