 I've been exhausted for two weeks and exhausted by the last week. And so last night I got to be about 9.15, 9.30. And I thought to myself, I am sick of feeling this way. What do you do when you feel exhausted again? You feel very little motivation. Oh yeah, sleep. Sleep is the gift that God gave us to solve the tired problem. I'm like, I'm just going to go to sleep right now. Boom, 9.15. Turn on my little white noise generator with my phone so I would hear nothing. I got my favorite pillows arranged exactly the way I like for maximum comfort. Got the temperature just right and went to sleep. And then I woke up. I'm not kidding you. At 10 a.m. I slept for almost 13 hours. I don't know how sick or anything. I'm healthy. I just needed 13 hours of sleep to put my body back together in some way. And I feel amazing. They am hopped up on goofballs or something. I don't even know what goofballs are or what it feels like to be hopped up on anything. But it is incredible how much I was depriving myself over the last really several weeks of functionality, of life, of energy, of energy for my family, of the ability to have fun and savor things and see past stupid things and enjoy life and feel productive. And oh my goodness, I woke up this morning and I was like, hmm, which world needs to be conquered? Yeah, this one. Let's go. And it is almost as if the way humans and earth are designed is such that rest on a regular interval is a really good thing. And I'm not sure I've ever had it sneak up on me the way it just did. And I'm not sure I've ever so felt the results of resetting the system with meaningful rest the way I just felt it over the last 24 hours. Well, how funny is it that the whole time I'm sitting here like, Oh, I'm exhausted. This has been a really difficult couple of weeks. I'm really struggling right now. And the whole time I've literally been doing a podcast conversation with you about the Sabbath. Like literally I got rest right in front of my face all day long while I'm researching and writing and reading the Bible and thinking about this. What I'm driving at here is the question that is left for us in Matthew chapter 12 versus one through whatever verse eight where we're dealing with this Sabbath controversy between Jesus and the religious leaders. The religious leaders seem to think that the Sabbath should be on absolute lockdown. Jesus on the other hand doesn't seem to have any of those same reservations. And these two interpret what at the time is the Bible completely differently and it is problematic. So clearly as we open Matthew chapter 12, there's a lot of tension between these two parties so much so that I might to understand that the Pharisees are maybe even just walking along and shadowing Jesus and his disciples. I'm bawling them carefully to see if maybe they touch something or lift something or sow something that they're not supposed to on the Sabbath. And they're like, boom, got it. Hey, you can't do that. They say in paraphrases mine over the disciples rubbing some grain together in their hands and eating it. And then as we have looked at in painstaking detail, Jesus responds by entering into a game of idea ball. He's willing to go and play on their ideological rhetorical home court, but he is dominant on their home court. And part of the way that he demonstrates that dominance is with this one, two punch of rhetorical techniques that they all would have understood. Punch number one is to say, haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God and he gave he and his companions the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. Boom, that punch is the rhetorical style of drawing on a story and pulling the principle out of the story. Then he hits them with the two of the one to punch and that comes in or having you read in the law that on the Sabbath, the priests in the temple, desecrate the day and yet are innocent. Hits them there with some legal reasoning. So he employs two of the most common argumentative techniques that these guys would have known in a way that they're used to, but he does it with some sass because he's like, I'm surprised you guys aren't familiar with like the Bible or whatever. Because if you were, I mean, you'd remember this thing about David and you would definitely know this thing about how it works with the priests. So you got the one to punch with sass, then you have the reference to Jose a six six that we talked about yesterday. I desire mercy, not sacrifice here. The point is you guys are ignoring the humanitarian part of the Old Testament that has baked into it allowances for people who are hungry to eat food. And come on, bless it are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they'll be filled this hunger and being filled thing. That's a God value. And then you guys are scaring that with this weird Sabbath thing. And then he rounds it out by saying the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath. So that's one way to look at how he responds to them. One to punch a little more Bible, a declaration of authority. So in grand summary of multiple episodes worth of conversation about this, the point of this passage never really was about the Sabbath. It's about the authority of Jesus. And he makes three authoritative claims because he knows what they're actually talking about I'm greater than David, I'm greater than the temple, I'm greater than the Sabbath. So the reason the Pharisees don't respond and the debate doesn't continue is because there's nothing left to debate. Jesus just dropped the hammer and either you accept his authority or you reject it. They reject it. So we're done here. I don't remember who asked, but somebody in the subreddit brought up a great question in response to this whole Matthew 12 thing. They were like, what did Jesus actually say here that was so dominant that the Pharisees couldn't even reply? And I think the answer as presented by Matthew is twofold. One, he really did out maneuver them using the one to punch and techniques they were familiar with. They just didn't have an answer for it immediately. Maybe they would have if they'd taken more time and if two hadn't happened, but two, he made these claims to authority. And so my guess is that the Pharisees were like, all right, that's just, that's blasphemy. You're saying you're bigger than the Sabbath, but you really want to make these veiled claims to deity because that's not even that veiled. And that is blasphemy too. You want to say you're greater than David? No, no, no, no. We're just too offended. And so I think they were able to hide behind the offendedness thing and just walk away from the discussion. And that's why Matthew doesn't give us a record of this thing unfolding further. If there's a third reason, maybe it's just that they got what they needed, which is Jesus on record saying things that would be shocking and offensive when they went and tweeted it later. And it would be enough to get a sufficient percentage of the population riled about Jesus. I don't know. We spent a ton of time on this passage looking, first of all, at what it says about who God is. And then we spent time looking at what God seems to be doing here. And now, and only now are we finally ready to answer the least important question in any given passage we look at. And that is what does it mean for us? What does this mean for my weekends? And I know they're very smart, very good people who would say this passage speaks to that big time. But I would disagree with those very smart, very good people. My take on it is, I don't think we get an answer here. I don't think Jesus was actually trying to solve the problem of what you should do or not do on the Sabbath. I don't think that's a question he had in view. I think that's the question the Pharisees wanted to bait him into. But masterfully, Jesus refuses to make it about the Sabbath and what you do and you don't do. And instead, he's like, no, guys, let's just call it what it is. Let's be honest about what we're really debating here. And that is my authority. Who actually am I? Am I who those demons said I am? Am I who I suggest and I am based on all the things that are happening that are fulfillment of prophecies that point to the Messiah? Let's have the actual conversation, gentlemen. And if you're not willing to have the actual conversation, then I'll just spell it out one more time. I'm greater than David. I'm greater than the temple. I'm greater than the Sabbath. Who do you think I am? I don't know. Obviously, I'm not qualified to improve on the Bible. But if I could offer a suggestion if we were doing a fresh edit, I would have then had the Pharisees be like, well, yeah, I don't want the audio. And then I would add Jesus be like, say my name. And then I would add the Pharisees be like, yeah. And then I would add Jesus be like, you're, no, he can't say that. Never mind. The Bible's good the way it is. I think if Jesus wanted to spell out what you should do and not do on your weekend, this would have been a great opportunity to do it. But he doesn't do it here. Might it come up elsewhere? Oh, yeah, it might. I think we'll tackle it deeply as it does come up elsewhere. Now, here he's dealing with the question of his own authority. And if you get to the end of this thing and you're like, well, does God hate rest? No, God is pro rest. Well, does God hate the Sabbath now? Well, no, that's not the case either. I think the obvious takeaway is just as rest served me greatly last night, finally getting some sleep and putting myself back together a little bit. So the Sabbath is meant to serve the needs of people, not people are meant to serve the needs of the Sabbath. People are people with souls and they're made in the image of God and stuff. The Sabbath is an institution. You can't offend it. It can't be a victim. But again, unless anybody would look at the theology of this and be like, yeah, there's nothing to take from this as it applies to you at all. I would just say, just jump back to Matthew 11. Look at how brilliantly Matthew organized this document. Do you remember what the preceding paragraph was? Check this out. Jesus says right before we get into this whole Sabbath rest controversy thing, come to me, all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I'm gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. And then we get right into the stuff that we just spent the last week or whatever looking at. That is a very intentional contrast and a very intentional statement that ultimately rest is not found in the notion of Sabbath. Rest is found in the king. High five, my friends. We just finished the very long look at Matthew chapter 12 verses one through eight. Tomorrow we're on to verse nine and whatever is next. Thanks for making time to hang out with me and get a good night's sleep tonight. It'll make a difference. Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
