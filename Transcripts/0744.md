 Hey, what's Matt? This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. I have a cold today. I apologize for that. It's a bad day to have a cold because when you have a cold, it kind of flattens out your voice. You lose some inflection and humanity. And on a day when you're going to open by criticizing something, it just might not be a good idea. I could abort now, but I'm committed. We're doing this. I want to criticize that new Lord of the Ring show on Amazon. I'm not one of these who was all mad that it was going to exist. I wanted it to work out. I watched it and it didn't work out. Nothing personal. If you happen to really love it and think it was great, it's cool. It's fine. That doesn't mean I'm smart and you're dumb. Maybe you're reading it right and I'm just too simple and I'm missing the beauty and the nuance of the thing. But I don't think I am. I think they really missed on their character construction, their character arcs, their characters are woefully unlikable and unrelatable. I think they are trying to please some passing modern cultural orthodoxy more than they're trying to tap into the story that was great. But at the same time, look, I got empathy for him. JRR token is dead and with him went his amazing ability to write stories about this world. And I'm not sure that the people of the 21st century are built to write in that tone. So maybe it was just doomed from the start. Maybe there's something more insidious underneath that made it break. Maybe it's just the kind of thing where you look at it and you go, half a billion dollars. That's the kind of money that you send for foreign aid in a war. And you used that to resurrect Middle Earth and it's just not compelling at all. Feels like that should have worked out better. But all of that said, the thing that I think I like the least about the show is it's attempt to call back to the source material. It does all of these weird little nods to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Maybe there's some to the Hobbit as well. It seems like it's kind of ignoring the Hobbit, which in terms of the film adaptation, that's probably good. That didn't go as well as the Lord of the Rings. But the callbacks don't mean anything. They're they're lazy. They're just like, Hey, remember that. And they really call back to make sure that you get it. We are talking about this. Remember Gandalf? Remember when he said this in a scene that looked just like this? See that's continuity. And I again, maybe you absolutely love those callbacks and that makes it fun for you. For me, that's what a lazy callback looks like that doesn't accomplish anything other than a quick nod to a fan to cash in on some of the loyalty they had to a previous product to make them like the new product. I don't think Matthew works that way. I think his callbacks have been excellent when it's time to really hold the reader's hand and say, Hey, make this connection because this connection is meant to be fulfilled. He spells it out. I suppose by comparison, if you're watching a show where the earlier material that's been out for a long time has prophecies that need to be resolved, then when you're making your show that is now said in the future from those old shows, you'd want to be like, remember when they said this, it is as was prophesied in days of your that this would happen. Behold, okay, that works. I got no problem with I'm even very enthusiastic about the way Matthew connects those dots for us, the reader, because he's trying to make the point that Jesus is the king who was promised. Well, then you got to connect it back to the promise makes perfect sense. But Matthew also has this deft touch with other callbacks, as we've discussed over the last couple of days, that leave a little bit of room for ambiguity, leave a little bit of space for you to wrestle with that and to think beyond the neat tidy, it was prophesied that you would be born in Bethlehem. Look guys, he was born in Bethlehem. Cool, smoking gun prophecy. Did check the box. It's awesome. I want that spelled out. But there's other stuff where it's well, what does it mean to be numbered among the thieves? What am I supposed to take from that? What does it mean that his garments get divided up? What am I supposed to do with that? Then it seems like especially around the crucifixion account, Matthew is really content to let us grapple with that. And as we've discussed, make those connections as we gradually make those connections for ourselves. Again, part of what we're seeing here when Jesus says he's the fulfillment of the law and the prophets is the fulfillment of literal prophecy where you can say it's a one or a zero, either he fulfilled it or he didn't. But he's also the fulfillment of the law, meaning literally the rules like the sacrificial law, the civil law, but also meaning the story. He's the fulfillment and the completion of the whole story of the whole narrative arc of the Old Testament. Bata, dah, dah, dah. And then Jesus is the thing that you just are waiting for. Dah, dah, Jesus. And that stuff is of course going to be more ambiguous. So what I wanted to do today was quickly buzz through some of those things who attentive readers of the past have connected in terms of a very thoughtful but very deft gentle callback to Old Testament stuff that is happening here in this rapid fire section regarding the crucifixion that we've been looking at. So let's pick it up with verse 34, which looks like a nod back to the Psalms. It says there they offered Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall, but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. Bible, turning Bible. How can it take me so long to get to Psalms? It's the biggest. There's so many Psalms. I should have been able to hit that on my first try. Okay, here we go. Psalm 69 21. They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst. Now, this is a Psalm that is by David. It's one of those where he's in big trouble. He's being challenged and pursued by his enemies. So there's a whole lot of context here that sort of overlaps with what's going on with Jesus, but the nature of the friction is different. And yet it seemed very important for Matthew to include this little detail about the gall. And we talked about reasons he might have done that based on what witnesses saw the other day, but also I think he put it there because it's a pretty direct callback to someone who points to Jesus in serious ways in the Old Testament, that being David. All right. Next verse 35, Matthew 27 35, when they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. We're going to go back to Psalm 22. And actually a couple of these come right out of Psalm 22. If you've been around the Psalms a little bit, you know that this one connects heavily with the Jesus stuff. Psalm 22, where's it at? 18. Here we go. They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. You know what? I was going to go verse by verse, but let me just read more of Psalm 22 because that'll be more fun. You're going to make the connections yourself. See this is us discovering things together about how to make a podcast about the Bible. Check this out. Psalm 22 starting from verse one. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me so far from the words of my groaning? Well, good heavens. We're not to the part where he says that yet, but if you've been through any of the gospel stories, you know that phrase, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me is going to come up and you know that that abandonment theme is all over the place in Matthew. Oh, my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer by night and I'm not silent. Again, this is David who's in hot water. He's under all kinds of pressure, but this sounds a lot like what we're seeing in the crucifixion account. Yet you are enthroned as the Holy one. You are the praise of Israel and you are fathers, put their trust. They trusted and you delivered them. We're not talking about the nefarious prophets who Jesus was lumping the modern day Pharisees of his time in with there. We're talking about the patriarchs, the people who trusted God when it wasn't easy. They cried to you and were saved and you they trusted and were not disappointed, but I'm a worm and not a man scorned by men and despised by the people. Are you seeing all of this stuff? All of the callbacks, all of the payoffs, all who see me mock me, they hurl insults, shaking their heads. He trusts in the Lord, let the Lord rescue him. Let the Lord deliver him since he delights in him. Seriously? I mean, this is like flaming red hot, connect the dots kind of stuff. Yet you brought me out of the womb. You made me trust in you, even at my mother's breast. From birth, I was cast upon you. From my mother's womb, you have been my God. Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help. Many bulls surround me, strong bulls of Boschon and circle me, roaring lions, tearing their prey, open their mouths wide against me. I am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint. That poured out. Drink offering thing. My heart is turned to wax, it is melted away within me. My strength is dried up like a pot sure. And my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You lay me in the dust of death. Dogs have surrounded me. A band of evil men has encircled me. They have pierced my hands and my feet. I'm starting to feel stupid for pausing every time something that's just smoking gun obvious and clear connection happens. So I'm going to try to just keep reading, but I know you're doing the work here. I can count all my bones, people stare and gloat over me. They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. But you, oh Lord, be not far off. Oh my strength, come quickly to help me. Deliver my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs. Rescue me from the mouth of the lions. Save me from the horns of the wild oxen. I'll declare your name to my brothers. In the congregation I'll praise you. You who fear the Lord praise him. All you descendants of Jacob honor him. Revere him all you descendants of Israel for he's not despised or disdained to the suffering of the afflicted one. He's not hidden his face from him, but has listened to his cry for help from you comes the theme of my praise and the great assembly before those who fear you will I fulfill my vows. The poor will eat and be satisfied. They who seek the Lord will praise him. May your hearts live forever. All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord and all the families of the nations will bow down before him for dominion belongs to the Lord and he rules over the nations. All the rich of the earth will feast and worship. All who go down to the dust will kneel before him. Those who cannot keep themselves alive posterity will serve him. Future generations will be told about the Lord. They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn for he has done it. And then of course famously the very next verse is the Lord is my shepherd I shall not be in want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside quiet waters. Psalm 23 comes right on the back end of that that psalm of tranquility and trust in God because of what he's done in his character and who he is. So Matthew is drawing on all of that stuff. He is reminding people at this last moment when Jesus is being lifted up and crucified. He's reminding them of the psalm they all knew the words to that they all saying that they all know he's drawing in all of these details trying to be like look that the payoff here. Look at what is happening. Like one last glance at what this image is and what it is obviously in fulfillment of and he isn't just drawing on Psalm 22 to accomplish this as we talked about. He's also looking at Isaiah 53 and drawing on some other stuff as well. This is what it looks like to execute a deft call back to source material. Everybody knows in such a way that yeah, it's very obvious if you're paying attention at all, but when it clicks and you see the patterns, that whole thing has the potential to just snap into place. And for people who were on the outside looking in and didn't get it to suddenly get it, Matthew clearly knows his audience. And if we do a little bit of footwork to get around the Bible and try to understand what he's drawing on, we can align ourselves with that audience he understood and was writing to and make a bunch of the same connections as well. High five Matthew, you are good at writing the Bible. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
