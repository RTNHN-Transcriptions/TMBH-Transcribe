 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and I'm going to go do something with my family today, and I think it's going to be delightful. However, I do not want to step away from what we're working on. I want to stay on task here and keep moving forward. And so yesterday, we talked about this term generation that Jesus uses at different places in the Book of Matthew, and then it comes up in a very important way in Matthew 2336. I tell you the truth, all this will come upon this generation. Well, depending on what he means by that word, we could interpret the passage and think of a lot of different timelines that make sense here. And so to make sense of that and to set us up for what is coming down the pike in chapter 24, I am going to bounce it to my friend, Aaron, who's really good at this stuff, and he works with me on TMBH things and who you've seen probably on 10 Minute Bible Hour YouTube videos, and I'm going to go bum around with my family just a little bit. So with that said, Jeffrey is going to put some music right here and then enjoy the conversation with Aaron. All right, catch you soon. About that is we like to argue over which generation is better or greater than the others. It's often used in kind of a negative way to pit us against one another and everybody likes to kind of rah-rah my tribe. We're the best. And I don't know that that's totally helpful, but it's kind of fun to play the game. And one of the ways we do that is we think about our music and the music that sort of stamps our generation and gives us an identity. And I've been thinking about this as I share some of the stuff that I grew up with with my kids. Some of the stuff from my generation just doesn't make sense. Here's one of the biggest offenders from my childhood. One of the, this was a band that I really, really liked as a kid. This is from Duran Duran. And I want to read these lyrics to you and see if you can make any sense out of it at all. The reflex is a lonely child who's waiting by the park. The reflex is a door to finding treasure in the dark. And watching over Lucky Clover isn't that bizarre. Every little thing the reflex does leaves you answers with a question mark. So I really like my generation, but I can also poke fun of it and say, yeah, we sang those lyrics at the top of our voice and they're probably totally nonsensical. But it illustrates a point in what we're talking about here. How do we really make meaning from things? How do we listen to conversation? How do we read literature or listen to songs whether they're from 2021 or 1985? How do we make sense of those words and derive meaning? We put them together in context. And in this particular case, there's no context at all to give meaning or try to explain what the reflex is. It's totally disjointed. But we do this every day. We do it in conversation, listening to songs, watching movies. It's something that we do every day. And when we come to the Bible, when we come to the biblical text, it's actually just the same practice. And so we're going to look at that today. How do we look at the word generation? And how do we look at how that word is used in its context and derive meaning based on the clues around it? So an example of how this works in real life. If I tell you I was walking at the circus and I got hit by a trunk, you're going to probably think that somehow I got hit in the face by an elephant. If I tell you we were at the store and we threw the groceries in the trunk and headed home, you're going to understand that I put all those messy little plastic bags in the back of my car and headed home from the grocery store. If I say in my neighborhood, I watched a young boy learn to ride his bike and crash into a trunk, you're going to follow that he probably hit a tree. In each of those examples, you can just tell from the context how the word is being used in terms of its range of meaning. So we're going to do the same thing. We're going to look at a few verses from Matthew's gospel as he's using the word generation and do just the exact same thing. The first place Matthew uses that word, generations is in chapter 1 verse 17 and he says this, for all the generations from Abraham to David were 14 generations and from David to the deportation to Babylon 14 generations and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ 14 generations. And so there you have typical around the context, he's obviously talking about family line and periods of time related to such. That's the usual context of generations. However, everywhere else that Matthew uses that word, it functions a little bit differently. Here's Matthew 11 verse 16 and this is Jesus talking to the disciples of John the Baptist who asked him a question, should they expect someone else or is Jesus really the Christ and Jesus answers them and then Jesus turns to the crowd and says, but to what shall I compare this generation? It's like children sitting in the marketplace calling out to their playmates. Matthew 12 verses 39 through 45, Jesus uses the phrase extensively. Now in this context, he's speaking directly to subscribes and Pharisees because they come to him and they're demanding a sign that he proved to them supernaturally that he is who he says he is, but he answered them, an evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. In verse 41, the men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented it to preaching of Jonah and behold, something is greater than Jonah is here. In 42, the queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. Now those two verses are referencing a couple of episodes from the Old Testament, the book of Jonah where Jonah went to preach to Nineveh and they repented and then the queen of the South is the queen of Ethiopia who came to hear and sit at the feet and listen to the wisdom of Solomon in the Old Testament. So Jesus is referencing both of those events and contrasting those two groups of people with this evil and adulterous generation. And he concludes this in verse 45 with a parable about a man who had a demon driven from him, has a sanity restored, but then refuses to come to a full acknowledgement of the truth and reality and the demon returns to him with seven other spirits. And Jesus says this to these scribes and Pharisees, then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself and they enter and dwell there and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So it will be with this evil generation. So Jesus is using really strong words here and he's used the word generation four times in this little paragraph. In chapter 16 verse four, again speaking to Pharisees and Sadducees, he calls them evil and adulterous and evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign. And then in chapter 17 verse 17, Jesus says, oh, faithless and twisted generation. Referring to a father who's come to Jesus and asked to have his son healed because the disciples were not able to drive the demon from his son and but Jesus has to do it himself. And he says, oh, faithless and twisted generation. And then of course we have Matthew 23, which we've just been talking about recently. Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. And this is at the end of the seven woes pronounced against the Pharisees. And the final use of the word is in Matthew 24, which we'll cover in the weeks ahead. Jesus says this, truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Now, a couple of things to note, when he says this generation, he's obviously using it as a pejorative and he's using it in context to those who follow him. And what should I say about this generation, the generation that he's talking about is the people that don't follow him. And he refers to them as evil, evil and adulterous even. And in the biblical text, adulterous or adultery can often mean literal, marital unfaithfulness. But more often than not, it's a metaphor for spiritual unfaithfulness. So in evil and adulterous generation, and he even says a faithless and twisted generation. So what Jesus is getting at here isn't 100% clear yet, but we know it's not good. And we know that he's referring to people who refuse to follow him and refuse to acknowledge his rightful place as the king of kings. Now, the other thing to note here is what's absent from each of these contexts outside of chapter one. Chapter one is talking about the usual sense of the word generation. It's talking about life spans and human progeny. All of the other contexts lack any mention at all of any temporal aspect. And they also lack any mention of a family line or a race that's being preserved or tracked through family trees. No mention of time, no mention of family tree. So the interpretive problem that often arises from this is trying to determine as Jesus, chapters 23 and 24, is talking about a race of people or generation of people in the Bible. It's usually about 40 years or so. But when we ask the question that way, we force ourselves into a false dichotomy. And I'm not sure that's exactly how Jesus is using the answer. We're going to look at this a little bit deeper tomorrow from a few verses outside of Matthew's gospel, where the word generation is used. And I think that will give us a lot of clarity and help us make sense of how Matthew is using the word and what Jesus is actually doing here and what he's trying to say and how that really relates to us. So thanks for being with us today. I really appreciate you sitting with me as I fill in for Matt here. I want to mention this too. If you have been along for the ride and you appreciate what Matt is doing here to 10 minute Bible Hour podcast, we're really grateful for that. And we would love it if you would jump on to iTunes or whatever podcast app you use and give us a review. That's one of those things that is a simple step on your end, but it helps us put the podcast in front of other people because of the way the algorithms and things work. So if you'd be willing to take a few minutes of time and go do that for us, give us a review, we'd really, really be grateful. If not, we're just glad that you're here. We're going to pick up all the loose threads tomorrow and tie them into a nice picture that makes sense. I really appreciate you sitting in with me today as I fill in for Matt. We'll do this again tomorrow.
