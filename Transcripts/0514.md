 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And yesterday we started by talking about that famous quote from Conan the Barbarian, where he's like the greatest thing in all the world is to crush your enemies, to drive them before you, and to hear the lamentations of your women. Because I guess that's how people who are super muscly and have swords and have battles in ancient times. I guess that's the kind of thing that they would say. Maybe more recently in our lore, if you've ever watched, and I strongly recommend against watching this or any program or looking at anything with your face in any way. But if you've happened to accidentally watch Game of Thrones, you know, this is a similar idea here. The iron throne that is the object of everyone's lust and desire in that show is made of all of the swords of the fallen enemies of the kingdom. And it's a reminder of the power and authority. And this is what you get. You fight against this throne. It's all a giant flex just like Conan's remarks. And Psalm 110 verse one has some of that flex credibility as well. The difference between Psalm 110 and the Game of Thrones thing and the Conan thing is that Psalm 110 holds itself out as being from God. And the most all powerful grand being and all of existence that can't be defeated or thwarted is the one talking about his authority and pointing this thing out. The exchange goes like this between Jesus and the Pharisees. I think this is a chill exchange. I think they are being reasonable at this point. I think they're in a place where it would look to the original audience. Like maybe their hearts are going to soften and they're going to hear what Jesus is saying. So it goes like this, while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, what do you think about the Christ? Who's son is he? The son of David, they replied that would be a relatively predictable answer. Though some might have been hung up on this title of Lord and there might have been some debate as to whether these were two separate characters. Picking it back up verse 33, he Jesus said to them, how is it that the son of David speaking by the spirit calls him Lord? For he says, the Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. If then David calls him Lord, how could he be his son? Now as we were talking about yesterday, I think what Jesus is doing here is he's not refuting the idea that the Messiah is somehow the son of David or that the title son of David is wrong. I think he's calling for an expanded understanding of what the title son of David means. So to get this, we're going to go back to Psalm 110 as promised. Why did I not mark this? I could have saved us. So, so, so much time found it. Psalm 110, sorry, I'm bumping the microphone. Podcasting is hard. Bibles are large and heavy. Psalm 110 one, the Lord says to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion. You will rule in the midst of your enemies. Your troops will be willing on your day of battle, a raid and holy majesty. From the womb of the dawn, you will receive the due of your youth. That's just poetic and awesome, by the way. Can we just stop and appreciate that that's written in a way that is magnificent and grand and artistic way to be David? But can we also take a second to note that clearly there are three parties in this conversation. Party number one is whoever is writing it. In this case, David, that's the name that's been attached to it for a super long time. The last verse of Matthew 22 tells us that nobody could argue with Jesus after he was talking about this passage with the religious leaders of the day. So apparently they don't have any objection to him crediting this Psalm to David. They believe David wrote this. They believe it's a messianic Psalm and really everybody ever with the exception of a very small minority of thinkers have felt that Psalm two, Psalm two, right? I think it's Psalm two and Psalm one 10. Pretty much everybody has always been like, yeah, those are messianic Psalms for sure. Now, in fairness, they're smart, competent, decent people of goodwill, people who believe a lot of other things like I happen to believe, people who I disagree with on a lot of things, but competent people who would argue that Psalm one 10 here is more in the moment that it isn't prophetic, that it doesn't point to the Messiah. But at this point in David's life, there would be expectation of that and the internal language of Psalm one 10 certainly looks messianic. And the New Testament quotes this as being messianic. I don't know if it's the most of any Psalm in a messianic context, but if it's not, it's got to be dang close. I mean, I've got a list around here somewhere that I jotted down. It's a ton. It's not like one or two references. And even just this footstool language is referenced at least three times. We got the one in Matthew 22. We got the one in Acts two that we looked at and then somewhere toward the beginning of Hebrews, I would assume that it's in chapter one, the very same argument gets made that we were looking at Peter making yesterday. So it's all over the place. Just to be fair, there are people who don't think this is messianic. They don't agree with my read on this. And I want to acknowledge that they are competent and acknowledge the existence of their argument before we charge forward. But even for you and me, reading this roughly 3000 years after it was written down, it isn't tough to see what's going on here. David character number one seems to be listening in on a conversation between God, the Lord character number two. We're not doing this in any kind of order of importance here. It's the way I'm counting it. And some other character David is referring to as my Lord, that is character number three here. I think the best read on this text is that my Lord is the Messiah. My Lord here is Jesus of Nazareth. And so in that case, God is saying to his son in a manner that sounds a lot like the affirmation that the Father handed down to the son in Matthew chapter three at his baptism, the father is saying to the son, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool under your feet. There's where we get the cone in the barbarian language. And specifically, this footstool under your feet is pretty well known ancient Near Eastern slang for completely devastate and subjugate your enemies and the people who threaten you and make them your servants destroy them entirely in battle. Here are the lamentations of their women. So then the first part of Psalm 110 that I read to you, it sounds like a king who's got this mighty scepter. That's what kings have. You will rule in the midst of your enemies. Oh, that's what kings do as well. The troops will be ready to go holy majesty. But then in verse four, which we haven't read yet, this says the Lord has sworn and will not change his mind. You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. Whoa, now we're into a completely different thing. And this sounds a lot like Hebrews. Hebrews chapter five deals with this Melchizedek character and him as like this ideal high priest, this go between between God and man from the Old Testament. And then the book of Hebrews in the New Testament deals with Jesus in this role of this perfect priest that is the go between the mediator between God and man, the one who resolves the problem of sin and death and everything that's wrong. And that's probably a much larger conversation. But what we're seeing then just here in Psalm 110 is a pivot from king majesty, ruler, sovereign language to priest language. And that's a very, very different role to be played. But so far we're two for two. I mean, if you're crying out loud, what have we seen throughout the book of Matthew so far? We've seen a Jesus who talks about kingdom and authority and he speaks with authority and everybody's in, oh, this authority is authority over everything. And to sign up to be a follower of him, you pray an oath of fealty, everything about him smacks of king, but also everything about him smacks of priest as go between. I mean, what's the role he's playing? He's interacting with all these people, but he's still dependent on his father. He is playing this mediating go between role that is going to be even more fully carried out at the cross. Well, then in verse five, it pivots again, the Lord is at your right hand. He'll crush kings on the day of his wrath. He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth. Again, scary language. When you hear it now, we try to talk nicer. Well, I don't know, not always on the internet, but in general, we've got a more of a sensitivity to language on things like this when it's morally convenient or politically convenient for us. But the reality is, I mean, this is how the conversation would have gone in 1000 BC when this stuff is getting written down. Nothing about this would have seemed out of the ordinary. This is the politics, the mindset, the notions and metaphors for power and success and glory and victory that everybody would have understood. Verse seven, he will drink from a brook beside the way. Therefore, he will lift up his head. And so first we see my Lord, I think the Messiah's role as king, then we see it as go between as high priest. And then thirdly, we see his role as the victorious warrior who handles his business and defeats all the enemies and brings safety and provision to everybody. And you think about what we just looked at here in Psalm 110, how closely does that correspond to the Lord's prayer? All the stuff that is supposed to happen in the Lord's prayer that God provides when you bend the knee and take this oath of fealty. It's all accounted for here too. Justice, mercy, protection from enemies, deliverance, daily provision, righteousness, all of that stuff is accounted for right here as well. Psalm 110 neatly corresponds to everything about the life of Christ that we've seen so far in the book of Matthew, it neatly corresponds to the oath of fealty that Jesus says this then is how you should pray, the Lord's prayer, the sign up prayer, even if you will. It's all there. And so when Jesus comes back to the Pharisees and he's like, hey, you know, who do you think the Messiah is? And they're like, well, he's the son of David. What Jesus is really effectively saying is you're absolutely right. He's the son of David. But when you guys say son of David, you're saying that with a lower case S, you should capitalize the S because it's a title. And in this case, that title refers to the one who all this authority and power and right to rule and prime spiritual position and right to go out and challenge the forces of evil and defeat it and make everything right and square and better. All of that is invested by the Father in that son, the son of David, the son of man, the son of God. These characters are one and the same and all of the promises of the Old Testament about the line of David about the restoration, about all these other things that are supposed to get straightened out and made right by the redemptive powerful work of God. They all culminate in Christ, bantah Jesus, everything from that Old Testament culminates in Christ. And Jesus is geniously speaking their language in a way that for you and I, it takes maybe two or three days worth a conversation to sift through, but for them would have popped immediately in such a way that I think they came away from this being like, dang, he's right. And he's right succinctly and we get it. But I think a bunch of them also come away from this feeling like we already kind of committed here to taking a certain course of action. And as much as their eyebrows might want to go up in the middle, as we've discussed, I think they get angry eyebrows instead and decide to stick with the course of action they've chosen, even though they know they are wrong. This is so important to the biblical narrative and the original audience especially would have quickly caught after the end of chapter two, what we've been looking at like, dang, Jesus enemies knew they were wrong. He got them, they understood and they hardened their hearts and they did this dark thing anyway. We're not quite done with this passage yet. We've got a little more work to do and we are going to get after that, my nyana. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and let's do this again soon. you
