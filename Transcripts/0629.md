 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. And first of all, listen to my voice. I still sound like this. Oh, well, I'm working on it. Thanks for your patience with me. Just a little under the weather still. Thing number two, I'm looking at this Matthew 26 business. Just coming right out of the Olivet Discourse, chapters 24 and 25. And I got to say, Matthew is assuming a lot of cultural background knowledge as we pick it up. I mean, have you ever stopped and thought about just what it would be like for somebody from a completely different culture or even different time to come and do just one day of political banter with us right now? I think it'd be overwhelming because the way we talk to each other, we assume everybody knows which political party is which and who thinks what and why this is obviously hypocritical because you what that same person or group said just a few months ago. And we always have this cache of front of mind knowledge when we're talking about the world and our culture at any given time. And I think that cache is just something that we assume everybody holds that is made up of recent events people are discussing. So for example, if a year ago, I'm like, hey, be careful what you say somebody might walk up on stage and slap you. Everybody be like, yeah, because I guess somebody could get mad and slap somebody generically. But as I'm recording this, we're just a few weeks out from Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars and everybody's still talking about it. And so that same phrase said now versus a year ago, conjures a recent current event image. And if some time traveler were to come from the future, you'd have to fill them in on some of that stuff for them to get all of the levels of meaning. This is just common sense. But every now and then we run into a part of Matthew's, we've been working through it where it's a little more on display. I'm reminded a bit more distinctly that I'm not from this moment in history. And as much as I try to understand it all, I don't know all of these dance steps. I don't have all of the same front of mind stuff that the original audience did. So I think we got a little bit of work to do quickly here today to kind of piece together who some of these people are and what's going on. Here's a passage we're looking at. Matthew 26, one, last couple of days we've been noting how Matthew uses this repeated narrative punctuation to say, all right, now we're done with that kingdom stuff. Jesus taught and now we're on to the next thing. So here it goes like this. When Jesus had finished saying all these things, I think all indicating that we're talking about, not just the Olivet discourse, but all the big teachings about the kingdom continues. He said to his disciples, as you know, the Passover is two days away and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified. All right, well, let's just start with this, the Passover. Everybody reading this would have known what Jerusalem was like because it was Passover time. If you live in the Black Hills of South Dakota and you're talking with each other and somebody's recounting a story and they're like, yeah, it was last summer and it was during rally week and I was out driving on this narrow road in the hills. Whoa, like, okay, you're an outsider probably as you're listening to this. I probably didn't mean much to you, but to somebody who lives in the Black Hills of South Dakota, rally week means a million, almost a million, motorcycle riders from all around the country and the world descend on this tiny town of Sturgis and there are motorcycles everywhere and the behavior changes and the culture changes and everything is different for a week and what it means to get around is different and so this hypothetical story that I was just stitching together about, I was driving on a little road in the hills. Everybody's gonna be like, oh, it's rally week. This is gonna involve motorcycles. I can picture what that's like. So here we get an immediate context that would spring to mind for the original audience about Jerusalem at Passover. Dang, that place bloats to multiple times. It's normal population. Doing businesses hard, buying things is hard, but also everybody's trying to sell you something and the travel and the traffic and the smells, everybody's head is gonna go to this place of, this isn't just Jerusalem we're talking about. This is Passover week Jerusalem and we're only two days out. We're really on the home stretch here. Secondarily, people in the original audience might've had their heads go to what Passover symbolizes. I assume everybody was still thinking about that. Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread is kind of a two-pronged holiday that goes back to back and did at that time as well. It's established in Exodus. I looked this up earlier, maybe 14. I don't know why I'm flipping to it. I don't know, it's in there. Maybe I'll find it and read it some other time. But the point is, this is, you know, an ordained by God festival, an ordained holiday that happens in two parts and the Passover part is meant to serve as a remembrance from when God's people were in captivity in Egypt and then God miraculously liberated them and redeemed them out of slavery. And that incident is something that the rest of the Old Testament always harkens back to when reminding the Jewish people, the Hebrew people, the Israelites of God's character. It's always like, yeah, this is the God who led you out of slavery in Egypt. And the idea is that there is redemption yet to come, that God is not done with his people and that in a way the Passover was a deposit, a foretaste of this even greater redemption and rule of God that is still to come. And ultimately all of that, as we've talked about, and you're bad, and you're bad, and you're bad, points to Jesus as being the completion of that little riff, the completion of that story arc. So the Passover thing would have conjured most immediately, God's providence, God's guidance over his people, God's justice, how even after long periods of difficulty, God is still present, he still plans to redeem. There are specifics that would go along with the Passover celebration and remembrance. Of course, the Passover literally is a reference to the final plague of Egypt. Some of the plague seem campy and comical, looking back on them like frogs and locusts and we don't live in a culture where we think about as much what that would do, food shortages that would cause all of that kind of business. But the one that I think is always hit home for anybody in any culture is the one where the firstborn child dies and the way that the Israelites were instructed to avoid such a fate for their households was to chill a lamb and then put the blood on the doorposts and the blood the way it was put on the doorposts and the story of the Passover in a primitive way imitates the shape of a cross. Maybe that's intentional, maybe it's not, but it's something that Christians point to there. And so the story goes that God in his justice punishes the evil of the slave-holding Egyptians and liberates the slaves and that liberation comes about because the slaveholders just will not tolerate any more of this, they can't handle it. The loss was too great that occurred with the Passover thing, but the judgment passed over the houses of the slaves, the houses of the people who had the blood on the door and it's hoping you know, pass over, you see what's going on there. So this holiday is initiated to celebrate God's justice, God's righteous judgment, God's promise for deliverance and his deliverance from Egypt and his deliverance from slavery in Egypt and the slavers who were there. And so the Feast of Unleavened Bread is a seven day festival that comes right on the back end of Passover and it recalls that flight from the slavers in Egypt and is evocative of some imagery that's used in the Bible in the Old Testament that likens leaven or yeast to sin and even Christians and how they do communion of carried forward an element of this tradition in that oftentimes the communion wafers are the kind of cracker things that will get used in communion in different Christian traditions will be unleavened. All of this to say that when the original audience read this from Matthew or just heard the story verbally from person to person about what was happening, the week on the calendar where all of this was going down would have been very important to people being able to picture the setting. Things are on edge, things are going big. Yes, it's a happy time of year, but it's also a stressful time of year. And it's a time of year where you're supposed to specifically remember one particular thing. The attentive original audience member would have then had that spiritual reality in the background of their mind as the events that unfold with Jesus' execution and resurrection are happening against the backdrop of that week. And I think the intent would be for people to connect the dots. It would seem that Jesus very intentionally knew when he was showing up there. Matthew very intentionally is letting the audience know when he was there. And it's not just for proper biographical timekeeping, it's because Passover means something. And the idea is that somehow Jesus is connecting the dots here, that in showing up on Passover week and doing what he did on Passover week, this is a rounding out of what Jesus said in Matthew 5, 17, that he didn't come to abolish all the stuff that had come before, but that he came to fulfill it. And so Jesus and Matthew and Christianity in general are asserting that Jesus is fulfilling what that Passover idea is about. And we'll be digging much deeper into that in the coming weeks. Tomorrow's gonna be fun. We're gonna fill in some more historical background on who Caiaphas is and this group of people he's meeting with here and how that all fits into the story as well. Thanks for hanging out with me and enduring my voice. And that, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. Thank you.
