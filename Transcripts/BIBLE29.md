 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Joel. I'm looking at something right now, right here in front of me, that is very troubling, disturbing even given the conversation we are having. I'm going to keep eyes on that while we talk, and I will tell you more about that in a minute. We're talking about the book of Joel this time around, which is kind of an outlier in terms of what we're seeing pattern wise with all of these Old Testament prophetic books. One, it's very, very short. It's only three chapters long. You can read it probably faster than you can listen to this conversation that we're about to have. Two, we don't really know anything about the guy who wrote it other than what his dad's name is. Three, there's nothing to orient by in terms of where we fit historically here. You know how in all the other prophetic books we've looked at so far, we get some kind of thing about like in the fifth year of King such and such, of the land of such and such, the word of the Lord came to this prophet guy. So you know what's going on politically in the background, and it makes it a lot easier to read through those prophets and be like, ah, that's an image for this. And that's a reference to that. And oh, that's fulfilled over here. Well in Joel, we don't really get that. It's more open ended in terms of where it fits historically. And it's also more open ended in terms of when the things it predicts are going to happen. Look, there's no two ways about it. When we get to the end of this discussion here, and I say the part about like, hey, when you visualize Joel picture this, it's going to be. Locusts, because locusts and particularly a locust swarm is the key image in the book of Joel. And in chapter one, we get a locust swarm that looks like it's an actual description of an actual literal locust swarm that came and crashed onto presumably Jerusalem and Judah in a literal sense and just torched everything. I mean, ate everything down to the bone down to just leaving white sticks where there used to be fertile plants and everything is wrecked and it even puts the sacrifices on hold because people don't have anything that they can bring. And I'll get destroyed by these different waves of locusts that came along. And I just need to remind you real quick that I'm looking at a thing right now and it's getting more disturbing as we talk. I'm sorry for the distraction, but I just can't take my eyes off of it given the conversation. We're having more on that again in just a minute. And so the second locust swarm happens in chapter two and it looks more like a figurative locust swarm. We're dealing with something different here and the language of the locust swarm in chapter two seems to be anticipatory of something that is yet to come. And the locusts look like as Joel describes them more carefully, it looks like they're not actually bugs. They're some kind of warriors and God is leading the charge. He's leading this judgment there, flowing over the walls. And it's very, very creepy imagery. Well, in keeping with the style of all the profits to this point, Joel is like, we got to repent. What's interesting though is again, he doesn't say like, we got to repent of this. Now Joel, for my money quotes from more books of the Old Testament than any other Old Testament author I've seen so far. It looks like he must be writing very late in the production of the Old Testament because he's familiar, like super, super fluently familiar with all of these themes in scripture. And it looks like he's drawing not only on prophetic word from God, but also he's just deeply rooted in what's already been written down. And he's seeing some themes here that he seems to be drawing toward a future view of completion that is still to come, which is pretty exciting. And we'll get to the second half and that stuff here in a minute. So Joel just generically is like, hey, we got to repent. What of? I don't know. He quotes like eight other books of the Old Testament. Presumably everybody reading the book kind of knew what they were getting wrong and what to repent of. It's just a general repentance that Joel is saying that everybody needs to assume a posture of repentance before God because for a hundred different reasons, we're on the opposite side of what he wants and what his character is about. And this is clearly the judgment of God, these locusts and whatever this visualization of this second locust swarm is all about that he refers to as the day of the Lord. So there's your first half of the book. Now back to the thing that I'm looking at. And down here in my basement all day working on this book of the Bible, thinking about it, reading it again and again, trying to understand what the locusts are and what do I say to you. And I got my little headphones on here. It's my little silly self important studio area. I mean, it's just a room in a basement and I've got this great big box soft box light in front of me. It's like four feet across and it's covered in this kind of canvas stuff that softens the light and the whole time that I'm reading Joel. I keep hearing this racket, this fluttering, this noise of paper sliding and because it picks up in the microphone, I just happened to have the headphones on for no good reason. I keep looking around like, what the heck? What is making the noise? And I'm already a little creeped out about locusts. And finally, I see it. I look up into this big light that's right in front of me, like straight in front of my face right now as we speak. And I see all these little legs crawling around. And I realize that there is apparently a family of wasps. Is that a thing? And they are huge. They're in there. I can see their feet walking around on the light and I keep hearing them fluttering and moving. And I don't really know how to kill them or get rid of them. But let me tell you that when I started working on the book of Joel, I got to admit that my initial visceral reaction to the upset. And I said, this is about the whole locust swarm thing was like, well, you know, it's a more primitive time. Simpler people freak out over bugs. And you know, I'm sure it was really unfortunate like grasshoppers and stuff. That's bummer. That's tough for them. But then I keep hearing this noise in front of me and I look up and I finally see what I'm up against. It's crawling again right there, right in front of me right now. And it's huge. And I'm reminded that maybe it's okay to be a little bit concerned about bugs and what if there were so many of these that it blacked out the sky? I would be mortified. It would be the kind of thing that is such an apocalyptic plague level that the little tiny bit of anxiety I feel right now would instantly shoot to a billion times more. And I would be asking questions about life, death, God, the meaning of everything, the collapse of the universe, whether this was the end of all days and all things. It's a long story short. I'm very grateful to these wasps that are trying to build a hive and reproduce in my light softbox right in front of me today because they made me better understand what Joel was writing to. Thanks danger bugs. Back to what we were talking about in the middle of chapter two during this repentance bit. Joel gives us the most famous line from this book and indeed one of the most famous lines I think from the Old Testament. It goes like this, render heart and not your garments return to the Lord your God for his gracious and compassionate slow to anger and abounding in love. And he relents from sending calamity. Who knows? He may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing, grain offerings and drink offerings for the Lord your God. So obviously Joel is saying, don't do fake repentance. God wants your heart. This is anticipatory of all the stuff that Jesus says in Matthew five and the sermon on the Mount about like external obedience is one thing, but God wants obedience and love devotion at the level of the heart. Well after he gets done saying that kind of stuff, which is thematically beautiful, the whole tone of the whole book pivots. And even though this locust swarm version, this terrifying expression of the day of the Lord is still right there in the rear view mirror, we start to pivot toward another day of the Lord that is also terrifying in its awesomeness, in its wonderfulness. Both are going to represent a gigantic sea change, a gigantic shuffling up of everything. But the second one seems like it's really good. And initially what we get through the end of chapter two and into chapter three is a description of the short term things that God is going to do. And those include being close to his people again as they repent. It includes defeating foreign invaders who were oppressing or being used as a judgment against his people. And it involves fixing and healing the land like at the end Disney movies, when everything turns green again after it was all ruined. There's this visual of the land coming back together and being put back together. God is not going to let this desolation last forever. And it looks like Joel is saying this day of the Lord is in the near term and that the people who are reading this book are going to experience that. But then he goes even further and visualizes a day of the Lord that is in the far distant future and is yet to come. And it's going to have an even bigger effect, but that is going to look like this upcoming near term day of the Lord. And in this grand day of the Lord that is far off and yet to come, there is a restoration of the land. It's like the healing of land. There's another healing of the land, but it's this return to the paradise of the garden. It's this restoration of the land that happens when union between God and man occurs and evil is defeated. There's a grand restoration in view. It's a terrifying sea change, but it's a good terrifying. There's also in this upcoming day of the Lord that's going to happen far, far down the road from now a defeat, not just of the oppressive nations, but of all the nations. They're all going to bend the knee to this God. That'll be a pretty dramatic change and it's going to upset a lot of systems. It will be terrifying, but terrifying in a good way and with a good outcome. And then finally, in the same way, in the near term redemptive day of the Lord that Joel predicts, there will be a reunion of God and his people, a greater intimacy. So in this distant day of the Lord that Joel anticipates, God's spirit is going to come and dwell not in a building, but dwell among his people. So Joel is drawing on that imagery that you and I have seen going all the way back to the beginning of the Old Testament with that cloud of the presence of God that dwells in the Ark of the Covenant, that dwells in the tabernacle, that dwells in the temple. The Jeremiah sees departing the temple as the exile Babylon stuff is going on. Where does the spirit of the Lord go next? We're left hanging still over the last few books that we've been reading since Jeremiah. Well somewhere in the future in a beautiful, awesome, terrifying day of the Lord and it looks like there are a few of those predicted throughout Joel. God's spirit is going to dwell among his people. It looks like that gets fulfilled in Acts chapter two when the Holy Spirit shows up, not as the product of a flame in the cloud and the smoke, but the actual thing that makes the cloud and the smoke itself metaphorically, the actual flame, the tongues of fire appear above the heads of the disciples as the Holy Spirit shows up and dwells them. The locust thing is really troubling as a metaphor for the forces of this world and even the forces of nature and the idea of billions, literally billions of independent moving parts, a natural drone swarm, the idea that each and every one of those is operating at the command of the Lord. That none of that is surprising him is baked into what Joel is describing here, but he uses that very powerful, terrifying metaphor to flip it around and be like, well, the God who's powerful enough to do that is powerful enough to deliver in ways that exceed anything you could possibly imagine. And drawing on the imagery of the wasteland created by this horrifying locust swarm that left nothing behind and everything desolate, we get this great image of reversal and hope that God is going to restore this new Eden and restore unbroken fellowship with his people and that the presence of the Lord will dwell among his people again as the evil nations are one day brought to their knees. I'm telling you, Joel is good. This is really well constructed and you can read it multiple times very quickly and you will start to see the patterns and appreciate the beauty of what is happening here. And I think the fact that Joel doesn't carefully locate itself in one moment in time. I mean, really, this could be something written during the era of Israel and Nehemiah. This could be something earlier on in the era of the kings. I really can't tell for sure. And that if anything, just further accentuates the power of the imagery. Obviously, when you visualize Joel picture a locust swarm, when you think about the theme, reflect on real heartfelt repentance in the context of the terrifying and awe inspiring day of the Lord. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to at least read for yourself chapter two versus 13 and 14. But really just sit down with Joel and read the whole thing. It's a win. You can knock it out for yourself and see it for yourself better than I can explain it. All right, my friends, we have leveled up on Joel and now I am going to go see if I can solve a metaphorical locust problem of my own. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
