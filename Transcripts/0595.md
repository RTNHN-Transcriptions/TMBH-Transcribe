 Do you all do horror movies? I really do much in the way of horror movies. We talked about this a few months ago after I watched Midnight Mass on Netflix, which I thought was really, really good. And then I was like, I'm going to go watch some more stuff that guy directed. Maybe I could watch a horror movie and find value in it. Nope. I only watched a couple more and I didn't even make it past the first scene. It was just not for me. It's too much. I'm weak. Then I'm absolutely unashamed to admit that weakness in front of you. But one of the things that I know from my limited amount of horror and suspense watching is that every now and then we'll be cruising through a scene. I'm like, oh, I know what you're doing with the music. I know what you're doing with the pacing and the camera angles. Ah, I get it. Okay. I'm going to watch this through my fingers. I cannot tell you exactly when the jump scare is going to happen, but I can tell you all the things that lead right up to the jump scare. Then I guess only the director knows exactly when the thing's going to pop out and there's going to be the moment or there's going to be a, oh, it's just a cat at first, but then it's a monster right after that surprise. That's for the director to know not for me, but I can give you a pretty good sense, even with a scary movie I've never seen before of what the paces are of building up to that thing. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 24, we just got done looking at a huge chunk of what's called the Olivet Discourse. It's the fifth of the great big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured and it's all prompted by the disciples being like, hey, sounds like you're going to die and go away and we're going to be here and we're going to have to kind of hold down the fort. Could you give us a heads up as to like when you'll be back? What will the end of things look like? What will be the signs of your coming, the signs of the end of the age? And then she says gives a pretty broad strokes answer to that in three or four parts depending on how you count it first. He's like, hey, a whole bunch of stuff is just going to happen. It's just the world doing what the world does wars and famine and things like that. That's not it. That's a big deal. It's tough. That's not it. And then he goes on to say there's going to be some kind of incident of profaning of the temple that occurs. That's going to be a little bit bigger deal. And if you see like the armies show up and the temple being profaned, like, you might want to go to a long weekend retreat or something. Maybe just get out real quick as you're able to. And then after that, there's going to be a time of suffering and during this time of suffering, some people are going to start to say like, Oh, son of man has returned. What's the Messiah? He's back. He's right over there. Jesus is like, don't fall for it. That's just all candy vans. Don't get into that candy van because finally when all of those things have happened, then the son of man will return and it'll be on the clouds and it'll be unmissable and like there'll be angels and stuff and the elect from the four corners will be picked up. And then he sums the whole speech up by saying in the same way when it gets to be sort of springtime, you go on and you look at plants, you're familiar with and they start to green up a little bit. You're like, Oh, dang, I couldn't tell you the exact day. So we're getting real close to spring. It's right at the door. It's right around the corner. So you will be able to see all of these signs. And as you do, and he seems to indicate that they'll see him while they're alive, as you do, you will know that this next thing is right around the corner. Everything's ready. It could happen anytime. And then this is a really long likewise, but it's going to connect. I promise we get to verse 36 of Matthew 24 where Jesus says, no one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven nor the son, but only the father. And yesterday we were like, whoa, how can you not know your Jesus? You know, all the stuff. And what we discovered from thinking back over all the things that we saw so far in Matthew, usual suspect style and then flipping forward to Philippians two was like, Oh, dang, like there was some kind of limitation that he voluntarily accepted. He voluntarily submitted death because he's in very nature. God, he doesn't have to die at all. He signed up for that. He's willing to do it. He's appealing to the father for help. So he's voluntarily put himself in a subservient position and submitted to the authority of his father. And he's asking his father for help and for provision. So all of that stuff is there. And I guess how can he not know? He can not know because he chose to not know, but there's another question that comes up right there. And the question is, wait a day, minute. If you don't know the exact day or the hour, then what was all that stuff about like big trees and profaning of the temple and flee to the hills and the son of man coming on the clouds and angels and the elect and famines and wars and rumors of wars. Like how could you give us that kind of broad strokes timeline if you don't actually know the day or the hour and here's where the likewise pays off all the way back to the thing. It's doing at the beginning with the horror movie thing. Well, the likewise is that in the same way, I can tell you all the beats that are going to get us right up to the moment where the thing will happen. But the precise instant that it will happen is only known by the director or the editor who ever worked on the movie. So Jesus apparently is limited in his knowledge of that exact trigger pull moment where the culmination of all things where the reckoning where the end of all of this where the return of the son of man is going to occur, he's voluntarily limited on that information. But he knows in somewhat specific strokes the paces that are going to run us up to that moment. He can anticipate those things far better than the disciples can and even involuntarily allowing this knowledge of this specific date, the specific moment to be limited to his father. He's still way more informed than anybody else and is more than capable of being like, look, you see all of this stuff. You're getting toward it in the same way that I'm like, look, that listen to the strings. You're dissing it and shrill, look at the way the camera's going around that corner. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. And so I don't think we should get to Matthew 24 36 and be like, oh, well, just so basically cancel everything Jesus just said because he doesn't actually know. Well, look, I mean, he's the most qualified person in the room to speak to the question. And clearly he thought the question the disciples asked had merit. I mean, come on, Jesus is empathetic. He is charging them with a big task. And it would seem that the take home message of everything that he told him was really just none of these things are totally within your control. Be faithful. Do the stuff you're supposed to do. Live out the values of my kingdom, regardless of these circumstances. And then in the end, God is sovereign over time. He's sovereign over the unfolding of things and the reckoning of things. And he will do what he's going to do as he's going to do what he's going to do. But any imagination that we might have reading this, we're like, Oh, the disciples were just so dumb back then. They were simple rubes who lived in a Northern Hillbilly hick country. And they just weren't as good at things as you and I are. And now that we've had a little more time to stroke our goatee and puff on our pipe and sip on our craft beer and scratch our butts with our bedazzled preaching jeans. Now we have determined that the exact date of return of Jesus is going to be right here on August 11th, whatever. This makes it clear that like if Jesus didn't know the date, like the prophet Kip from the local temple of future prophecy knowledge, he's not going to know either. This is reserved for the father and that's part of the design. It is then, I wouldn't say a concession necessarily, but a grand gesture of grace and empathy for Jesus to even spell it out in the broad strokes that he's spelling it out here for them. So, I find this passage to be so relieving. I, oh, I don't need to know. I can let go because this has been the most difficult thing for us to pin down in our whole journey through Matthew, right? Isn't it? Surely some of you have listened to this. You're like, Hey, wait a dang minute. I've liked a lot of what's going on here, but I have some pretty strongly formed, deeply held, well informed opinions about how the end of things is going to work out based on the Bible. I think you're showing a little preference toward this read and then others of you have shot me notes and you're like, Hey, I think you're showing preference to that read. And the reality is I'm not trying to show preference to any read. I don't even sure what the name of the position that I think the text is saying actually is in terms of how the end times work. To me, it comes off as being not particularly supportive of one singular, neat, tidy, little systemizable description of how everything plays out in the end. I could see how a few different reads on this could actually be very compatible with Matthew 24 and the surrounding passages. And that my friends could cause a lot of stress and anguish is where like, well, I want to know what the Bible says. I want to get it right. Why would I want to get the Bible wrong? I mean, we've tried so hard to get all the other things right. And it seemed like we can nail it down. We could look at history books and external stuff and look at the other gospels and see what he said there and kind of figure it out. But here, I don't know. It's challenging. Well, guess what? Jesus doesn't even know the exact day that it's going to happen. The whole point is that though it's an understandable question, this is kind of the wrong question. For the person who follows Christ, the kingdom citizen, faithfulness is the call for the long haul. So far, every Christian who's died has died without this thing being fully realized. So for every dead Christian ever so far, the call has been be born, live out your life and die in faithfulness to the values of the kingdom and to the king. And just know like these things are going to shake out. It's going to happen. Heaven and Earth will pass away, but Jesus words will never pass away. So cool. I care about what this says. I want to think about it. I think we get the gist, but also I feel like the pressure is a little bit off of us. If Jesus can't point to a calendar and say that's going to be the day right there because he's voluntarily limited himself from having that information and defers to the father on it, then maybe it's just fine that you and I can't point to the calendar either. And we can breathe deeply in and out and live in peace saying perhaps this is a chapter of the Bible that I'm not supposed to be able to neatly extrapolate out into specifics and map over the top of current events as neatly as I might like to. And perhaps part of the further value of the way this is set up is that it prompts the kingdom citizen to defer to the father in a way that follows the example of how the son himself defers to the father on this one. I appreciate you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again. I believe that it providesacious and colors to watch.
