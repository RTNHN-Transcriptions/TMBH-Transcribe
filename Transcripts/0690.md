 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. We're in Matthew chapter 26, verse 57. It goes like this, those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. Caiaphas is the big dog. He's the kingpin. He's the one who is always the big boss at the end of the level who Jesus was going to have to face. Jesus is being held out as the mediator between God and man. Caiaphas. He holds himself out as the mediator between God and man. It's a showdown. These two had to end up in the same room. They're about to end up in the same room, but we're in the middle of a deep dive into what we know about Caiaphas so that we can appreciate the gravity of the moment more like the original audience was able to. So we're going to pick it up where we left off last time around and go from there. Even though Caiaphas isn't on screen until the very end of Matthew, everybody knows that he is the big power, the kingpin. He is the head, the champion, the big boss of all of the people who were opposing Jesus, all of the people are presented as being the bad guys. They all answer to him. He's in charge of the cabal. And so the moment where his name actually gets mentioned, it doesn't have the same punch for you and me that it would have had for the original audience. It's like if you go to one of those Marvel movies, remember when those used to be fun? My goodness. It feels like work. Like, all right, well, I'm obligated we go to these Marvel movies. I got to find out what happens next or I won't be able to keep track. Okay, let's do it used to be fun. It's not so much fun anymore. But you go to the Marvel movies with somebody who reads the comic books and everything and somebody walks out and they're wearing like a blue suit with a red hood and you're like, Oh, look, it's blue suit red hood man. He looks blue and red, I guess. But the person next to you is like, Oh my gosh, it's, it's the silver donkey. And you're like, I don't as I don't know what that I don't is that good? I don't, I don't know what the silver donkey is. Can you can rewind it? I wanted this guy to explain the silver donkey to me so I can get it. It hits real hard for comic book guy doesn't hit real hard for you. Likewise, right here, the kyathis thing, it's not going to hit real hard for us because we just don't know that guy is unless you happen to be studying this era in history. But just know, this would have been like a big dramatic reveal for the original audience. Bop, bop, bop. Oh, there he is. To put it simply, the loyalists to Rome would have been pretty fond of kyathis. And if they had any gripes with kyathis, it would be that he wasn't effective enough in trying to bend the knee to Rome and to manipulate the religious politics in Jerusalem toward those ends that he wasn't shrewd and clever enough in prosecuting political warfare against those who were sympathetic to the zealots and the idea of independence. But nobody from that crowd would have been mad that he liked Rome. They were the appeasers and they liked Rome as well. They thought this was the only way forward. A whole lot of other people reading this who wanted to be done with Rome would have just despised kyathis for being, well, whatever the exact opposite of your political alignment is, he would have been that utterly reviled. Now probably where you're listening to this. It's not like a situation where your preferred politicians and most reviled politicians are the difference between having a country and not having a country or being independent and not being independent. Maybe for a few of you, that's the case. But if you can imagine the level of animosity, one might feel if the stakes were that high, then you got to apply that here. So the dropping of the name kyathis here is going to conjure a lot of emotions from a lot of people. This is a very big name. He is a part of a family legacy of power and being in bed with the Romans. And based on the fact that people rallied to Jesus side and responded to what John the Baptist had to say before that and frankly, based on the fact that people responded to several less compelling messianic claimants so enthusiastically before John and Jesus, you got to conclude that the era that was defined by Anas and kyathis and their lengthy combined high priesthoods, they weren't an era that inspired great religious confidence in the people, something that made people feel really unsettled and like, this can't be it. There's got to be something more. And so they were very receptive to the idea of a kingdom and indeed they even came out just a few chapters earlier. Waving pombranches and yelling Hosanna, Jesus, when he wrote in on a donkey, like they even knew what that meant and that it was a fulfillment of scripture. I guess what I'm partly trying to say is I don't think a lot of people reading this would have been like, you know, who gets it is kyathis. That guy right there has got a plan. He understands God and religion. And I've just loved the way church. I'm obviously using that term anachronistically and tongue-in-cheekedly. But man, things have just been great since that cat's been in charge. Kyathis, may he live forever. This is the best we've ever done it. Now, Kyathis was an establishment guy who establishment people would have really loved, but your normal people, they wouldn't have had a tremendous amount of affection for him, I don't think. And that's part of the reason that in Luke 16, where you get the story, maybe it's a parable. People don't know quite how to categorize it, where Jesus talks about the rich man and Lazarus. And there's this rich guy who has the five brothers or brothers in law, maybe. And every time he passes by the poor guy, he's like, I don't care about your stupid stuff. And he's jerking. And he dies. And then he realizes he was wrong about everything. He's like, let me go back and tell my five brothers about what's going on. It's like, no, we're not going to let you do that because even if somebody came back from the dead, they probably wouldn't believe. Well, if you read that in light of what we know about Kyathis from Josephus and from the Bible, I mean, you could see how somebody might think that maybe Kyathis wink, wink was supposed to be that scoundrel rich man who just didn't get it in that story of the rich man and Lazarus over there in Luke 16. For the moment here, I'm going to skip over all this stuff in this little summary about Kyathis that we're about to look at in Matthew 26, the stuff about the trial of Jesus and all of that. It's literally the next thing we're going to do. So put a pin in that, but Kyathis continues to play a role on into the book of Acts, which is like the sequel to the gospels. It's what happened after Jesus died and is resurrected and in the sense in the heaven. After that, Kyathis continues to cause problems in Acts chapter four, John, and Peter go and talk to both Kyathis and Anas. They're in trouble for having healed somebody with busted up legs or something. And it's crazy. And then Anas and Kyathis ask John and Peter the exact same question or effectively the same question that the religious leaders asked Jesus in Matthew 21. It's the question about like, Hey, by what authority are you doing these things? And I've talked about this so many times that I love this story so much. But then Jesus is like, okay, I got a question for you. What about John's baptism? Where's that from? And they go huddle up and they're like, well, we can't say it's from God. We can't say it's from people. So we don't know. And she's like, cool. I'm not going to answer your question either. Well, in Acts chapter four, Anas and Kyathis have that story rounded out at their expense as John and Peter are crazy emboldened. They'd been warned that they were going to have conversations just like this back in Matthew chapter 10 and the missional discourse. Yeah, you're going to go out. You're going to have some tough stuff to say. Like, don't worry, though. I got you in terms of what you're going to say. And so Peter in particular just let some habit and he's like, Jesus is the Christ and he's who you crucified, but God raised him from the dead. And it's by this power. Like Peter isn't subtle at all. There's no coil like, well, why don't you tell me something? And then I'll tell you like Jesus did the right thing in playing that game in Matthew 21. But Peter, this is a new era. This is a new time. And well, also it's Peter. And so he just thunders in there to Kyathis and tells him off vigorously and literally lays the blame for all of the crucifixion at his feet. And then Kyathis does the finger wagging authority things like, you can't talk about this. And Peter and John are like, Hmm, yeah, we're going to do anyway, says it right to him. I just judge for yourself. What's right? Like should we obey you? Should we obey God? And we're going to go ahead and say what we've seen and what we've heard. And it's just an awesome moment in the Bible. And it would have been even more cathartic for the first century version of the Marvel Comics fan guy who knows who the silver donkey is the first time he sees him, because they would have been like, Whoa, it's Kyathis. And I know everything about Kyathis. I'm like a huge fan of this whole Bible literary universe. And whoa, it's like the end of Kyathis's story arc. Because he got told off right there. That's amazing. It makes Peter look amazing. And it closes the book on what matters about Kyathis for the rest of this Bible story. I mentioned last time at the beginning of our conversation about Kyathis that he's an interesting character in terms of his relationship with history. Because he's all over the Bible. We get a lot of the details that I've just told you, those are from the Bible. A lot of those same details are fully corroborated outside of the Bible by Josephus. But then Kyathis also is a character who looks to have been confirmed by archaeology beyond the Bible and beyond Josephus. About 30 years ago, they dug up an ossuary, I don't know if it's limestone, I don't know what they carved those out of. They dug up a tomb, a casket from the first century that had a bunch of writing on it that talks about the family of Kyathis. And there was some debate for a while. Maybe people saying that it wasn't fancy enough for somebody of his standing, but other people say economically it makes perfect sense. And I think there's even been some more external corroboration since then. So it's like 90 some percent sure that we have physical evidence of Kyathis and his burial place. And I don't know if there remains in there. Like is there like a little bit of Kyathis dust still lingering around in there? I guess I don't know that. But it looks like Kyathis was in that box or in that room or tomb where those boxes were. So he's a pretty fascinating character from history because it's one of those places where you can go and touch a box. Well, I don't know if you're not allowed to, but if you were allowed to, you can go and touch a piece of physical history that is connected with like physically, connected with the guy who's going to end up condemning Jesus to death or bouncing him back to Pilate for the official sentence to be read. So it's a real neat connecting point. Historically, that is that this character is so well attested and that we even have modern evidence with near certainty involving him. I think that's kind of stuff is super fascinating. I like telling you about it. Okay, that's all I got on Kyathis. Hopefully it's enough for us to appreciate a bit more the gravity of who this dude is. Now the big bad guy is on screen. You can't go up the ladder any further. This is the kingpin, the guy in charge of everything. Now we know a little bit more about the pressures that he was facing and how the original audience might have felt or responded when they saw his name here. Surely they would have known. This is the showdown. Something got to give. What's going to go down? We'll talk about that more next time around. Hey, huge. Thanks.
