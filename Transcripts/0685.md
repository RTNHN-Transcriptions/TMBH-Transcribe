 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and we're looking at Matthew chapter 26 and very specifically verse 52, which happens right in the middle of the account of Jesus arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane. And in the midst of that arrest, the bad guys show up with swords and clubs and Peter imitates the bad guys. He tries to use their ring of power against them. He gets out of sword. He cuts off the ear of the servant of the high priest. And then this is what we've been discussing. Jesus responds thusly verse 52, put your sword back in its place. Jesus said to him, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Okay. Question. Should Peter and the other disciples have known that that's how Jesus would approach it. Would they have known that he would not like the sword thing? Okay. Let's start with no, it's understandable that they were confused. If as we looked at the other day, the material that Luke records and Luke 22 about, all right, you sell some stuff by a sword and they're like, all right, well, we got two swords and he says that's enough. If they misunderstood his meaning, if they were confused by that, if there was a little bit of give him the stick, don't give him the stick in their heads and they weren't quite sure what to do with it. Then maybe here in the immediate term, because they still have that conversation ringing in their minds, maybe they were confused and they thought possibly Jesus wanted them to defend him with violence now. But if they did think that surely they must have also known that that would be a departure from everything else about how they had done business and what Jesus had taught them. And to demonstrate that, I think we got to go all the way back to the very first stuff that Jesus is saying is first a flow of thought that we ever encountered from Jesus here in Matthew chapter five, it's the sermon on the Mount, you'll recall Matthew one is where we get the big genealogy that sets it up so that we're like, Oh yeah, that whole story. Every one of those names in the genealogy points to another gigantic story that demonstrates the consistent character of God and the consistent promise that there's going to be some kind of redemption that's going to come from somebody who's going to reign on the throne of David forever. And then chapter one gives way to chapter two, which is a bunch of birth narrative. We see the maniacal ruler who wants to kill all the babies, kind of like the maniacal ruler in the Exodus who wanted to kill all the babies, but Joseph adopts Jesus and Mary and Joseph flee under the guidance of God and the baby is saved and Herod eventually dies. Then going into chapter three, we fast forward real far, John the Baptist Jesus cousin is on the scene. He's baptizing people and saying stuff like, Hey, the old ethnic boundaries of this family of faith. There's something more to it and God's going to raise up this new family of faith, which I think comes as a very intentional chaser to the stuff in Matthew chapters one and two that smacks of Moses, because out of all of the tyranny of Pharaoh and murder in the babies back then, all of the other things that happened, even passing through the waters of baptism in the Red Sea. What's on the other side of all of that is this ethnic family of faith that God creates for himself and moves toward the promised land. And here we see the waters of baptism. We see this tyrannical ruler killing the babies. His is delivered from all of that as Moses was delivered from all of that. And what's on the other side of those waters of baptism that we see in Matthew chapter three is a new family of faith. Once again, so that's what we get in three then in four, Jesus is tempted. He passes the test where every other human ever has failed. Then he goes and starts to recruit his disciples who don't really know much about who he is or what he thinks yet. Then we get the first full flow of thought from Matthew and Matthew chapter five, the first chunk of the sermon on the Mount. He introduces the values of the kingdom with the beatitudes. Blessed are this, blessed are that. They're all upside down values when compared to the values of the world. And then people are no doubt wondering like that sounds great and you seem really legitimate, but we already have a religion and it's super good. What do we do with the religion we have? Then Jesus anticipating that question in Matthew 5 17 famously says, don't think that I've come to abolish the law or the prophets. I haven't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. And then he goes on saying, I tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of the pen will be any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished. Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments, and then he goes on to say your righteousness would have to surpass that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law or else you can't enter the kingdom of heaven, which is supposed to cause everybody to be like, well, the nobody can enter the kingdom of heaven because the Pharisees and Sadducees and teachers of the law, they literally get to write the rules and everybody wink, wink, nod, nod knows that they gerrymander the rules around their own preferences and behavior and opportunity. So like you mean to say that even if you could write the rules so you would never be wrong, that still isn't good enough. And then this is where we make the connection with stuff in Matthew 26 about living and dying by the sword and violence and what you do in the face of it. Then Jesus goes into a series of it has been said, but I tell you that statements that demonstrate that even external adherence to the commands of God, which will never pass away. Remember, he just said that in Matthew 518 that this external adherence is not necessarily reflective of obedience at the level of the heart, but at the level of the heart. Everyone falls short of the glory of God. And I'm drawing on language from the book of Romans there with that particular phrase. Everybody sends everybody falls short of the glory of God. Only God is truly good. Only God is truly righteous. And so if you were he setting up a conundrum, if you were to get into this kingdom of heaven, it simply could not come by your willpower or behavioral management. It would have to come by a righteousness from God that is a righteousness apart from the law that would have to be somehow imparted to you to think of it in a more philosophical way. The entities one is perfect, unlimited in any way. And the other is imperfect. And they are not in relationship. There's only one of those two parties who has the ability to mend the relationship. The imperfect simply lacks the capacity's ability opportunity to make itself perfect. But the perfect would by definition, having no limitations, be able to take the imperfect and make it right, make it righteous. The perfect then is capable of acting on the imperfect, but the imperfect is incapable of acting on the perfect. That's the conundrum that Jesus is setting up by demonstrating that everybody has got flaws, but he's also still seeing through in the second half of Matthew chapter five, these values of the kingdom. And we're getting a little bit of a sense of what it looks like to prioritize, to think at the level of the heart, to operate at the level of the heart in a way that's in keeping with the values of the kingdom that he's describing. And one of those that particularly relates to this stuff in Matthew chapter 26 starts here in verse 38. You've heard that it was said, I for an eye and tooth for a tooth, but I tell you don't resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles, give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. Now we broke down all of the implications of this very carefully. Hundreds of episodes ago, it's back there. If you are like, whoa, I'm just catching up or I'm just jumping in here a little bit late. That seems like a really tricky teaching of Jesus. You're right. It is tricky. You can go back and check that out and see how we break the whole thing down. But what we are getting here is an expression, an articulation of what it would look like to do kingdom values at the personal level that there may be some dying to self involved in living out the values of the king and the values of this upside down kingdom. Hoarding may not make as much sense as giving and in keeping with these values that the original audience still didn't understand at this point. Jesus had a lot to say yet. It might not make sense to retaliate. Even though maybe the law permits it, it might be more reflective of being a kingdom citizen to not to forfeit your right for retaliation. Jesus goes on, verse 43, you've heard that it was said, love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your father in heaven. He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that be perfect. Therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect. So back to our big question. Should the disciples have known that Jesus didn't want them to go stabbing and slashing to defend Jesus? Well, before we even get into Jesus talking with them about the actual strategy, yeah, I think they should have known that violence wasn't their calling. That wasn't the role they were supposed to play. They were supposed to be son's daughter's agents of the kingdom and to live out these kingdom values. And it would seem that Jesus had already made it clear that this was the trajectory that it was on that they were not going to return the favor, even if someone struck them on the cheek, even if someone robbed from them, deprived them, harmed them, shamed them. It looks like at least bare minimum for them and their unique role, maybe for Christians in general, that that just wasn't going to be the game plan, that that automatic hair trigger response, if you did something to me, now I get to do something to you is just simply not a value of the kingdom that doesn't advance the kingdom. And again, this is before we even get into this stuff where Jesus is saying things about his kingdom not being of this world and him telling the disciples exactly what it is that he's here to do and what has to happen in order for that to all work out. And also what has to happen in order for the scriptures to be fulfilled about how he would be offered up as the sacrifice that he's going to be offered up to be. So on the one hand, is it possible that the disciples were just confused by the, all right, we got two swords. Okay, that's enough comment. Yes, it is possible that there was a lot going on and their heads were spinning and maybe they didn't have time to think it all through because all they really did was walk a little bit and then take a nap and this is all happening very suddenly. And so they just kind of reverted to what people would normally do because they're still a little bit foggy in what Jesus meant by the sword thing that we looked at in Luke 22. Yes, that's possible. But if we look at the whole corpus of Jesus teachings and the stuff that he specifically taught to the disciples, remember he took his disciples up on the mountainside and began to teach them in Matthew chapter five, that stuff we were looking at that was directed at them. Other people were just listening in. It looks like he spelled out pretty clearly exactly what he wanted his disciples to do in exactly the kind of situation that is unfolding here. That said, I want to be empathetic to the disciples again because that's hard. Like somebody you love, your teacher, your master, the person to whom your fortunes are are hitched even from a very worldly primitive sense. They call your families like, what the heck are you doing with your life? You're like, I am going all in on this homeless guy from Nazareth. I'm all in. Maybe they're even like, I cannot afford to lose. I cannot afford to be wrong about this. I don't really know how to swing a sword, but I guess I better try. Maybe that's where their heads go. But the key point is Jesus nips it in the bud and says that if you draw the sword, you're going to die by the sword. So I think it's pretty interesting that tension mounts and all of these ideas that have been in theory in better times in the past 25 chapters, push comes to shove and violence is very alluring. The disciples seem to jump at the opportunity or the parent need to go and do something about it yet even under duress, even though it might have felt good to have people stick up for him in that moment. He has to tell him to stop and he shuts down the violence. This one has huge implications. So we're going to keep working on it next time around. We appreciate that we get to do this together. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
