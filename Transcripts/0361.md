 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we are picking up where we left off last time around Which is Matthew chapter 15 looking at the feeding of the four thousand which is a very? Interesting miracle that is obviously gonna have a lot of parallels with the feeding of the five thousand which happened That many pages ago It's just right there in the last chapter and either Matthew is stuttering and is Overstacking similar events for no reason whatsoever or what he's doing here and including these two miracles So tightly next to each other is in keeping with the care and crafting He's demonstrated in the rest of the document and there is a point to it narratively and theologically that's the second one It's on purpose. It's really good. That's what we're gonna talk about right now. Jeff play music and then let's get back into it The disciples then who are still in intensive training mode at this point Are not tracking with this. They're not getting that this is the long-term plan So jesus is just gonna walk them through the exact same paces as last time. How many loasts do you have jesus asked? Seven they replied in a few small fish. All right, let's bounce back over here to 14 and just compare notes Uh, Matthew chapter 14 15. This is back over at gallily stock with all jewish people Is evening approached the disciples came to him jesus and said this is a remote place and it's already getting late You should send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food Jesus replied. I don't need to go away. You give them some to eat We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish they answered Bring them here to me. He said So at gallily stock in chapter 14 for just the jewish people We get the five loaves and we have two fish and that feeds 5 000 people the jewish people Over here at decapolis stock We have seven loaves so we have a little bit more bread now and a few small fish So maybe more fish whatever the case matthew does give us the detail that at decapolis stock That is how much food we started with and so then we continue with our comparison So uh matthew 15 now decapolis stock with the gentiles He told the crowd to sit down on the ground then he took the seven loaves and the fish and when he had given thanks He broke them and gave them to the disciples and they interned to the people all right. I'll go back over here to matthew 14 at gallily stock with the jews Okay Bring them here to me. He said and he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Ooh That is a key distinction to catch that In matthew 15 he told the crowd to sit down on the ground over here. He told the people to sit down on the grass Those are different words. That's not just a translation flourish on the part of this particular translation Meaning that the original audience would have expected that in the lush Sea of gallily of jewish territory that you would expect to sit on comfortable grass I think mark even gives a very specific description I think it's here of the green grass and peter was probably mark's source on that very specific detail Now jesus is having them sit on the ground in the harsher environment east of the sea of gallily Yeah, he took it. He looked up to heaven. He gave thanks over here. He took the seven loaves and the fish and he gave thanks And he broke them gave them the disciples back over here to 14. He broke them gave them to the disciples Yeah, and the disciples gave them to the people back over to 15 Gave them to the disciples and they interned to the people so it's pretty identical In terms of the mechanics of the whole thing and then rounding it out for the capitalist stock in chapter 15 with the gentiles It says they all ate and were satisfied afterwards the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces That were left over let me go over here To gallily stock with the jews in chapter 14 And it says they all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up 12 Basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over So everybody's fed at both events and there's way more left over and then it says in chapter 14 at the jewish Gallily stock it says the number of those who ate was about 5,000 men besides women and children We flip over to chapter 15 to decapolis stock with the gentiles and they all ate and were satisfied The number of those who ate was 4,000 besides women and children These stories are so Stinking similar in terms of structure and the very next thing that happens after both is they get into a boat and travel in in Matthew 14 There's a little bit of a miraculous interlude there with jesus and peter walking on water and all that business But they both end with the travel across the sea of gallily again verse 39 of chapter 15 Jesus is leaving to capitalist stock and leaving the gentiles behind it says after jesus It sent the crowd away. He got into the boat and went to the vicinity of magadan Real quickly. We don't know where that is some people associate with magdala either way it's a More obscure community probably somewhere in the nine o'clock vicinity if we think of the sea of gallily as a clock Which means that upon leaving the gentiles from decapolis stock on the east side of the lake We have now traveled to the west side of the sea of gallily back into jewish territory And if you weren't sure if we were in jewish territory the very next sentence at the beginning of matthew 16 says the pharisees and sageses came to jesus So we know we're back where the jewish people hang out because of that context clue So the 10 trillion dollar question here Is did something amazing just happen or did something amazing? Just happened because either way, I mean that was pretty good but Was jesus just being cool and meeting the needs of some people who showed up? Or did this mean something? Did this represent a shift in the ground rules in the plan of what people could expect? Well If the gospel ended right here or ended in the next chapter, I'd be like, I Maybe could go either way But in light of the fact that all of the old testament points to the idea That god made this deal with Abraham god made this deal with moses God made this deal with david with the larger nations in mind Would only make sense that if matthew is holding jesus out as the fulfillment of all three of those deals That jesus would be operating with those larger nations in mind and all three of those deals really overtly Have this larger thing in view. I mean the covenant with Abraham ends with you'll be blessed and you'll be a blessing to all the nations The deal with moses though it is expressed elaborately over several chapters of interaction between god and his people The bottom line is the nations are going to look at what I do with you whether you obey me or disobey me And therefore whether I bless you or punish you and they're going to know that i'm the one true god And then the unconditional deal that god makes with david Was that there's going to be this great king who will rule over all the nations and this authority will be more than just over israel And that that's going to come out of david's line So you can't fulfill the promises of the old testament without going beyond the physical and cultural and linguistic and ethnic boundaries Of the jewish people and now jesus is doing that Again if you read this passage in isolation Make of it what you will but if you read in the context of everything that's happened up to this point the gentiles who appear in the lineage of jesus the centurion whose faith that jesus praises This kennonite gentile lady who just a few verses ago Has this exchange with jesus that demonstrates her great faith and recognition of jesus as the fulfillment of that promise to david All of this stuff Leading up to this suggests that this matters and that this is exactly what it looks like If you're not sure and just grab the second half or what's left of your bible You can just thumb through all these pages and then you go from being No to okay. Yep. It's on every single page. It's all over the place This was clearly in view And this is one of the first really obvious shifts that is representative of something that is only going to become more obvious As we go along, but I want to leave it Here because I think there's a thing that we left a pin in Whatever a handful of episodes ago regarding this bizarre difficult to understand interaction that jesus had with the kennonite lady that left some of us feeling weird left some people on the internet feeling really weird But I think it's here for a reason strategically on the part of matthew I think it's another one of these don't don't don't and then you got to read more bible to get to the don't don't and the don't don't happens When jesus quotes this line that again, I think was a saying a slogan A political throwaway line to explain the jewish religious attitudes toward others in verse 26 He says to that lady who's just asking them for help. I mean she called him the son of david She gets it, but he says oh no, it's not right to take the children's bread And toss it to their dogs And then she says oh yeah, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table Ah, so she gets it. There's a hint and jesus is like you've got great faith and your request is granted and then what happens exactly next my friends He takes the bread that was supposed to be for the chosen people and he tosses it to the metaphorical dogs They're not dogs jesus doesn't think of them as dogs at least not in the insult way that you and I would usually Maintain a term like that he took the bread and he gives it to them in the very next passage This is all on purpose. This is all making a point and it is a great reminder that this is what goes wrong When we read the bible in little tiny Elemental pieces looking for the lesson about what we ought to do or how we ought to behave I mean that's in there and it comes up and when it's there, it's really obvious and evident But that insular read Stuff like that that is supposed to be glaring To just slide by and then we come off looking kind of dumb like the disciples as if we miss that stuff like wait Uh, where are we gonna get enough bread? It's like oh my goodness. Did you not read what just happened in the last month in context? again This is why I've got to remind myself over and over and over again to think big picture Because when you look big picture this document not only holds together beautifully But it takes the high ground and becomes a force to be reckoned with with how Effectively how beautifully it's crafted and thought through how efficiently it uses narrative and dialogue to communicate these massive Theological points to an audience who might not have had the patience to read a gigantic treatise But who might be willing to read one document like this Giving you one shot to make your case in a very loaded way That jesus is the long promised king that he is establishing the kingdom that he is the messiah And that that messiah is going to be a blessing and a kingdom builder for a new people of faith That goes way beyond the old boundaries, which is enormously Exciting and has massive implications beyond the first century I go on and on and on because I get excited and yet you hang out with me anyway Which means that you are nice and you are gracious and you can tolerate my quirks Which in turn makes my heart soft and I appreciate you. All right, I'm met This is the 10 minute bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon
