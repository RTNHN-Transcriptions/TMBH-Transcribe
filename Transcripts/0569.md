 Hello my friends, it's Matt, it was an 10 minute Bible hour podcast. I'm sorry for the clicking. That clicking right there, I got to do a cough drop. My elbow, a cough makes it hard to talk to the microphone because then I want to hack and gag and it's just apparently it's not appealing. I'm told people don't like the way that sounds. So cough drop it is. I don't remember the first third of Matthew like way, way, way back when we were just going to know each other. We were all babies back then. So much time has passed. It's crazy. And in the early going, we were like, Oh, there's all this stuff about Jesus. It kind of fits with what was predicted from the Old Testament. Could he be the guy? And it's kind of hard to tell. And then he does his first big public speech, sermon on the Mount, chapters five through seven, and he lays out the values of his kingdom and gives you a sense of what it looks like to follow God in light of those values. And then he gets done with that and he's walking down the hill and everybody, including hopefully you and me, if we were reading it, right? Are like, that sounds great. Those are the values that everybody of every political persuasion wants. That's the good stuff. Everybody wishes that could happen. Lots of people make lots of claims. How is this guy any different? How's he going to back that up? And then immediately he touches some guy and curses leprosy and then some government official comes up from the army and is like, Oh, he heals somebody I care about. Jesus is like, yeah, we can just knock that out from here and healings happen. And then all kinds of people come to me, heals all of them. And then all of a sudden he can cast demons out and command nature and defeat blindness and muteness and deafness and death itself. And people are like, whoa, this is a huge deal. And the religious leaders are starting to get a little bit nervous by the time we get to the end of chapter nine. And then Jesus takes that core group of guys who've been with them the whole time, but they're just now maybe starting to barely kind of figure out who he is. He's like, all right, gang, open world quest. Take this with you. It's dangerous to go alone and he sends them out with Matthew 10 seven. This message is you go preach this message, the kingdom of heaven is near. Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons freely, you have received freely give. And then you'll recall we looked at how chapter 10 breaks down into three different parts of this open world quest that Jesus sent the disciples out onto to go and represent him with that message. Part one of Jesus instructions in chapter 10 has to do with what it's going to be likely right now immediately when you guys go out and you do this little trip. Part two has to do with what you guys can expect later on in your life. And part three has to do with like, this is just going to be how things are for the people who follow me because it's how things are. And that was very, very much in keeping with something Jesus said in his first big public speech in chapter five, the sermon on the Mount once again, when he was laying out what we called the Beatitudes and of course the final Beatitude. Those are the values of Jesus upside down kingdom is blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven from the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. So right from the get go of his public talking ministry, Jesus makes it real clear that the people who follow him, like you're going to get persecuted and there's a blessing in this kind of suffering. And don't worry, like history shows, if you're on the side of the things that are true in kingdom oriented and of God, people who claim to like that God are going to be real, real tough on you. And then he reiterates that in the open world quest passage in chapter 10 that you and I just talked about, can you hear that cough sneaking up by the way? Do you hear it? Like just it's right there and it wants to take over everything and ruin our conversations just second or real good cough crop. Just a second. A little bit more. Sorry. It's worth it. Just healing juices get released when I chomp it around like this. Oh, yeah. We're reloaded and ready to go. And maybe even at the beginning of chapter 10, when the disciples were being sent out on this open world quest and Jesus is like, Oh, yeah, some people aren't going to like you. Just move on from those towns. Maybe the disciples are like, I don't know. I mean, this seems really good. Who doesn't like healing and hope and all of that? Yeah, maybe it's hard to picture. But surely as the disciples hang out with Jesus through the middle third, act two of the book of Matthew, they're like, Oh, dang, I get it now. There's literally nothing he could do that everybody would like. Somebody's going to be mad. Everything is a threat to some institution or something that you're very loyal to. That's very important. And even a moderately sophisticated person is going to be able to articulate some kind of very pious sounding reason why they can't do the obvious good thing that got. God wants them to do, but instead are going to have to be horrible to the disciples who are trying to do the thing that God says to do. And so after all of that persecution and push back and even violence and anger, we get to chapter 24 and that theme of it's a blessing to suffer, but you make no mistake guys, you are definitely going to suffer. It gets repeated even harder here and it gets repeated here in the context of the disciples asking a question about the reckoning, like the end of things. Like what's going to happen to the temple and when is all this stuff going to go down about the end of time and how will we know that we're in the moment in history where God sorts it all out? Tell us they say to Jesus, when will this happen and what will be the sign of your coming end of the end of the age? And then as we talked about yesterday, Jesus starts by saying, all right, well, like here's just how things are going to be moving forward. Don't lose heart over that stuff. Don't be surprised by that stuff. It's going to be wars, rumors, war governments are going to do stupid things into the world individuals are going to do stupid things. There's going to be natural disasters. There's going to be government inflicted natural disasters. All of this is in keeping with what the whole Bible teaches about the fallenness of humanity and creation and nature and all of this is a product of sin. It's that everything everybody falls short of the glory of God, but there's this other thing that is the standard of God, the glory of God, the realization of the kingdom of God that is way better. And even though that's been initiated, which is not there yet. So Jesus then is telling the disciples, yeah, yeah, just go past the red barn of false Messiahs. Just keep going right on past the car hinge of wars and rumors of wars. Just keep going right on past the Mecca, well, Bino squirrels, nations rising against nations and famines and earthquakes and all that different stuff. Don't lose heart. Don't get discouraged. Keep going until you get to the specific directions, which are for you and they're horrible. Matthew 24 verse nine goes like this, then you now speaking to the disciples themselves will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time, many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other. And many false prophets will appear and deceive many people because of the increase of wickedness. The love of most will grow cold, but he stands firm to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations. And then the end will come. And I wonder if after he said all of that, the disciples were like, can we go back to the Mecca of all Bino squirrels? Because we didn't get killed and beaten and stuff in that part. I like that part better. And all seriousness though, that had to be tough for them to hear because the things he described that are just going to keep happening, just keep rolling right on past that throughout the course of history because world kingdom is going to world kingdom. They were pretty bad, but now that he's speaking directly and specifically to these guys who are asking the question and who have committed their lives to following him. Now they realize, dang, I'm not getting to that reckoning that I want. I'm not getting to that vindication. I want to have happen. I'm not getting to that moment where all of the stupidity and the dumb Facebook posts and stupid tweets and all the wrongness about all the other people that needs to be straightened out and called into account where all of a sudden they'll all have to look at me and be like, dang, that guy was right all along all of that stuff. Yeah, I'm not going to I'm not going to just get there for cheap and free. I'm going to have to go through all of the suffering and all of this pain before any of this gets sorted out. There's some difficult things between here and there. And Jesus prediction for them was exactly right. All of them were persecuted. Judas, I suppose, aside who kind of persecuted himself, but the guy who replaces him, Matthias, 11 of the 12 ongoing disciples are all persecuted to death. And the 12th is persecuted harshly, but lives out his life in exile again as a result of persecution. And I know Matthew 24 is one of those passages that speaks to something that doesn't come up a whole bunch in the Bible. And that is how stuff going to shake out the disciples wondered about it. People's sense of wondered about it. Everybody wonders where all of this is going and what it's going to look like. So maybe these parts of the Bible get a little bit of disproportionate attention accompanied by a different technique or approach than we might apply to all the other parts of the Bible. And when people look at a passage like this, it's really easy to be like, what does it mean for me? How much am I going to have to suffer? Where are things going? Where does Russia factor into this? How should I vote so that Israel is positioned the right way for the end? Before we get into any of that stuff, remember, we're looking at a human story written by one of the people who is here for this. Think about what this must have felt like for Matthew to hear it. Maybe he and his buddies were holding out hope that they wouldn't have to go through all of these ugly things that Jesus is talking about and that he would just use his obvious miraculous power to just fix it all and make everybody bend the knee right there bow before me and tremble. All of you suckers. You guys who were obedient the whole time. You 12 come on up here. These guys were right all along. You all are jerks. And now we're going to change the whole world by force. And while at some point the Bible says every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. It's clear from this that Matthew is receiving the bombshell along with the other 11 dudes that is. Dang, we're not we're not going to be around to physically see that we're going to be the first wave of attack here and we are not going to survive it. And there are lots of theories about it, but I have no idea where Matthew even actually wrote his book. Maybe he'd already been persecuted by the time he was writing this. Maybe he was still anticipating that that was coming down the pike and maybe I should be careful about using phrases like coming down the pike when talking about Matthew. Since that's exactly how he died. He got run through, speared and staked to the ground tradition holds in Ethiopia for going out with that message that Jesus sent him out with in Matthew chapter 10. So yeah, there's some big pictures, theology and stuff to think about here and we're going to keep doing that. But also I think it merits pausing for a moment to consider what this moment must have been like for the guys we have been encountering the story of Jesus along with through the course of this book of Matthew. Well, that was bright and perky, wasn't it? And I've still got a kind of cough drop left. So that's probably another 20 or 30 minutes of my evening with limited coughing. Hurray for me. Thanks for hanging out with me. Sorry about the cough drop. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
