 Hey, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour tennis metaphor as we have discussed before. I really like playing tennis. I'm not that good at it. I picked it up a few years ago. I would like to think that I'm improving. My game involves a lot of finesse spinny stuff, probably to disguise a lot of the glaring weaknesses in my game. It usually works out pretty well when I play singles. I can trick people a little bit and stay in games maybe a bit longer than I should be able to. Every now and then, I really hit my serve, which is designed to have ludicrous amounts of spin. And if I get that right, that's very effective in singles. It kicks forward off the bounce aggressively into my opponent's business and they don't return it very well. And if they do get it back over now, I'm totally in control of the point. But in doubles, it always works out different. So with doubles, of course, you're playing against two opponents and you have a teammate. So if I'm serving in doubles and I managed to just happen to flukely hit my awesome spinny serve, what I find is that a lot of times my opponent, the person receiving the serve will just deflect it and that doubles the spin on it. And even though it looks like a limp, easy ball and like we should be in control of the point, my teammate will oftentimes miss it because of how crazy the spin is and I'll kick off their racket in a weird way they didn't expect, which is fine. And that's on me, not on them. But it's interesting to me how when I play doubles, if I happen to do my very coolest thing that I can do on the court, it usually doesn't actually result in any points. It usually boomerangs on us and hurts me and my teammate. Likewise, as we are getting into Matthew chapter 14, we are seeing this dynamic where Jesus does miraculous stuff, but it doesn't actually seem to work out that well whenever he does it. I mean, it's great for whoever had the miracle thing happen to them. Like if you're going to die in a boating accident and then there isn't a boating accident, that's awesome. If you're blind and now you're not blind anymore, I mean, that's great. The world is beautiful. This is wonderful news. If you were deaf and now you can hear, that's awesome for you too. But if we go and look at how things work out in the narrative every time Jesus does a miracle in recent memory as we get into the beginning of Matthew 14, we see that he's hitting this awesome serve. But then what happens right after that usually doesn't benefit what he's trying to accomplish beyond the cool thing that he's doing for that one individual person. So we pick it up in Matthew 14, starting in verse one, we're just going to do verses one and two today. And remember, we're coming off the kingdom parables discourse and at the end of the kingdom parables discourse, there's this little anecdote, this little tag where Jesus goes probably with his family from Capernaum back to Nazareth. Both of these places are in Galilee and in Nazareth, people are like, okay, we hear you teaching and we know you do wonders and stuff, but we're going to do that stuff. And also don't we know his family? And then all of a sudden it's like, I'm suspicious of you. This is weird. I'm offended. I don't like it. And then Jesus says in so many words, well, it's only in his hometown that a prophet doesn't have any honor and he doesn't do much in the way of miracles there. Pick it up in Matthew 14 one. At that time, Herod the Tetra, heard the reports about Jesus and he said to his attendants, this is John the Baptist. He's risen from the dead. That's why miraculous powers are at work in him. All right, narratively, there is a ton going on there that we need to get to most glaringly. It's wait, what John the Baptist is dead? Why? Huh? What happened? We didn't even get the narrative thing and what we're going to discover in a minute is that Matthew is telling the story a little bit usual suspect style. It's a tiny bit out of order here. We're going to flashback and find out how this jarring reality that Jesus cousin is dead actually went down. It's been hinted at earlier on, but now we're going to get the actual details. So we got to go, of course, and figure out where John the Baptist has been and what's going on. Last time I saw him, I think he was in prison. We also got to talk about which Herod this is. There are so many Herod's that's always disorienting. We're going to sort all that stuff out and make sense of it in the next couple of episodes. But I want to linger on this point. Herod has all been at his shape because he thinks there's been some kind of reincarnation. Like I killed the guy who was the problem. Again, that breakdown is forthcoming. And now it looks like he's back from the dead because I can't think of any other explanation for why this Jesus character is doing these miracles and John did a bunch of miracles. The miracle thing is the common thread. Jesus must be John and tempting, though, it may be to gallop forward into the salacious story that's coming up next. I'm hung up on this miracle thing and it seeming to backfire again. This is to the exercise together here. Let's go back and see how it's worked out the last whatever five, ten times the miraculous things have occurred. How does that pay off for Jesus? Okay. End of chapter 13. He didn't do many miracles in Nazareth because people were like, yeah, we're not really into it lack of faith. Chapter 12, they bring a demon possessed man to Jesus and Jesus is like, cool, you're healed. But then the Pharisees say it's only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, this fellow drives out demons. So it boomeranged again. He had a great serve, but it didn't score a point for the team or at least not. In the narrative political sense. I'm gonna go back a little bit further here. And oh, here we go. This is a guy with the shriveled arms still in Matthew chapter 12. He heals a guy with the shriveled arm and the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill him. Talk about your all time backfire. Okay. We're going back a little bit further. Matthew chapter 11 and verse 20, then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent. So what's he doing? I mean, he's going and saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand. So repent and get ready for this sign up for the real kingdom. The miracles are signs that point to the kingdom, to the authority of the kingdom, the values of the kingdom. And people see it and they're like, Oh, I really liked that trick you did. Oh, no, I'm not signing up for your thing. You can just forget that right now. I'm king of my own life, but that thing was rad and you can do more of that if you want to so that denunciation in chapter 11 really does flow out of miracles, even though those miracles aren't necessarily happening on screen. Number nine. Okay. While they were going out, a man who was demon possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus and then Jesus heals him. And the Pharisee said, it is by the Prince of demons that he drives out demons. Okay. Here's one going backwards a little further. Still in Matthew chapter nine, there's some blind guys that come to Jesus and they're like, Hey, have mercy on a son of David. And they kept following him and badgering him. And so then Jesus goes inside. That is key to the point I'm trying to make here goes inside and they come in. So it's totally private. And he's like, Hey, do you actually believe in the son of David? And they're like, yeah, yeah, we totally do. That's why we kept saying you're the son of David. And then he touched their eyes and said, according to your faith, will it be done for you? And then they can see. And then he says, see that no one knows about this. Do you remember when we got hung up on this a while back and I was like, why all the secrecy? Why is this? And then I promised that I really thought that was going to come into focus more later. I think it's coming into focus more later. These miracles, these great serves Jesus is hitting from time to time. They do not work out the way you and I would figure they would work out. So they go out and they spread news all over the region about what Jesus did. And that's part of the boomerang. In fact, we were just looking at there in chapter 11 where he denounces all the cities that didn't repent. We back up a little further and maybe you don't count this as a miracle. But to me, this counts as a miracle. There's this guy named Matthew. He's sitting in his jerk tax collector booth and Jesus is like, yeah, follow me in Matthew. He's like, Oh, okay. He follows him. And then there's this big celebration of a bunch of other misfits and cultural outcasts who are too naughty or bad or dirty. That is a miracle. That doesn't happen. That pivot doesn't occur in people's lives, especially in mass. And are people excited about it? No, Pharisees gripe about it and get after him. And it hurts Jesus political standing all the more right there. We back up a little bit further in chapter nine and we get the paralytic who was lowered down through the roof because they so badly wanted him to be healed. And Jesus is like, I see you there. You can't be a car son. Your sins are forgiven. And do you remember what happened? People got mad and they're like, ah, it's blasphemy. You can't be forgiving sins. And then Jesus heals the guy anyway. And a whole bunch of people are blown away and they're impressed by it. And they think that's really awesome. But even though it looks like everybody has to at least begrudgingly admit that that was really cool, that miracle still came with significant friction. We back up a little bit further to chapter eight. Jesus is on the boat and he goes to the other side of the lake and he goes to the region of the Gatorines. Remember the demon possessed guys are there. And he's just like, Oh, okay. Doki, we're done with that. And he drives them out and he sends them into a herd of pigs and the pigs go crashing over this steep bank and they go down and they drown and then outcome the townsfolk. And they're like, yeah, we don't really want to do anymore of that at all. We'd rather have demons ruining people's lives and still have our pigs than have these guys be better and not have our pigs anymore. So we're going to need you to leave. And in fairness to the text, if we go back any further than that, Matthew eight or even before the sermon on the mount where the miraculous stuff is kind of alluded to vaguely. The Pharisees have their antenna out. They're bothered by it, but they're not like murderously angry like they are as we're getting into chapters 12, 13. And now into 14, it's not just the religious leaders. It's political leaders are starting to get really angry too. And these people have the power of the sword. So this is scary stuff. So this entire conversation we're having today is simply about one thing. It's to draw out the motif that we have seen over the last five or six chapters that demonstrates that every time Jesus does miraculous stuff, it seems to cause at least as many problems as it causes good outcomes. He's hitting these monster serves, but in one sense, it's kind of backfired. And Jesus, nobody was doing he's in control of the situation. He's handling all of this the way he wants to handle it. But and I think this is very, very important. So if right now you're in the sweaty unit hard and you're like getting into the stretch run and you're a little bit distracted or maybe some thing is coming up on the ticker on the screen there and you're like, I'm looking at that. And I'm listening to the thing. Your kids screaming or stuff's going crazy. Your traffic's getting weird. Come back to me for just a minute here. Cause I think this is a really big deal. These people in the Bible, they're not different from you and me. They are you and me. The good things about them. The screwed up things about them. They're circumstances. They're just like you and me. They got miracles left and right. They got the things that you and I deep down, maybe theorize that would take our faith to the next level. If we saw them, these people said, I'd believe if you showed me something and then they didn't believe it was never enough. It was never the right thing. And likewise, I'm an evidence guy. I'm a skeptical guy. I may show me something physical, something that I can't deny kind of guy. I can't tell you how many times in my process of faith, my very bumbling process of faith, I have prayed to God or even made deals with myself in my own brain. I'm like, well, I would just need to see a little bit more. If I saw the stuff that they saw back then, oh yeah, you wouldn't be able to stop me. I'd be utterly convinced at every level. But they saw this stuff that they saw back then and they responded at about exactly the clip that Jesus predicted in the parable of the sower in Luke 16. And that story about the rich man and Lazarus, the concluding thought illustrates the same point that even if somebody came back from the dead, I suppose that wouldn't get it done for many or most of us. What I'm trying to say is you might read the Bible and be really jealous of how easy faith should have been for these people because they kept seeing it. They kept seeing the irrefutable stuff. But look what's happening. They don't have eyes to see. They don't have ears to hear. This stuff happens right in front of their faces and they're like, I don't know. I don't buy it. I'm not really in. And so for me, the epistemological take home here is that even if I had way more quote proof heaped upon me of all of these things and who Jesus is and that he is truly the king, that probably wouldn't be the thing that moved the needle and ultimately got me to a place of certainty or dialed in locked in faith. That dialed in locked in faith thing is going to happen. Belief because of the events and circumstances that we see that push the boundaries of the laws of time and space. It looks like that's just one little element and not the ultimate deciding factor one way or another. Jesus does a bunch of miraculous stuff in front of a whole bunch of people that communicates a whole bunch of truth about who he is. Some of those people look at it and are like, dang, I get it. I'm in. And the majority of those people look at it and are like, that was really cool. And I like the way things are. I'm still out. And I think if coming out of the kingdom parables discourse, we understand that that is how it is playing out. And that is how it would play out with us if we were there to. Then I think we're set up really well to move forward, having gleaned what we needed to glean from this theme of the miraculous that we've observed over these last few chapters. Next time around is a history day where we go and try and figure out which Herod we're talking about this time. And it's going to be a ton of fun. A map is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
