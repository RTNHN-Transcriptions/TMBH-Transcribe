 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 2nd Peter. Not too long ago we looked at 2nd Timothy, which was the end of the road for Paul. Now we're in 2nd Peter, and this represents the end of the road for Peter. This is another letter written by Peter to the same audience who is writing to. And 1 Peter is a general, mostly Gentile Christian audience in Asia Minor in Turkey. Again, it's in very pro-Roman territory. These are people who have felt under duress and just like everywhere else. False teachers who see an opportunity to exploit this upstart new idea and to glom onto it and get money and ladies out of the deal for themselves. They've showed up from all different stripes and started to insert false teachings. And now apparently they're even mischaracterizing the teachings of Paul to try to throw these people into confusion to separate them from their money and to gain prideful popularity and the following of their own all ostensibly in the name of Jesus. But in reality it's all about these false teachers. Well, just like at the end of 2nd Timothy, Paul knew, he'd been arrested a lot of times. He could tell the difference in different flavors of rest. He knew, oh, this is a big one. I'm not going to survive this. And the tone of the letter reflects it. Likewise, Peter had also taken a beating. He knew when it was a big deal. He knew when it was a little deal. And he could tell that the circumstances surrounding what was going on here, the heat that had been turned up in Rome, the fact that the Christians were a convenient scapegoat for some things that were going wrong in the current administration there in Rome. He's just new. I'm not going to survive this thing. And so maybe this is the only letter that he wrote from that moment of knowledge right before his execution in the late 60s AD. Maybe he wrote others as well. And this is just the one that we have preserved. But either way, the message is very straightforward as he's writing to these Christians who are being prayed upon by false teachers who do not love them the way Peter loves them. False teachers who do not love Christ as they ought to be loving Christ. And so he writes a letter that communicates this message. Following Jesus is costing me dearly. It's going to cost you dearly, and it's totally worth it. So remain faithful in action and belief in your loyalty to Christ. And so on some levels, what we're getting here is Peter's farewell tour. These are the closing remarks. If I could only say one more thing to you, and it had to fit on a little piece of parchment or a little scroll that could only be this big, I guess this is what I would want to say to you. But additionally to that, this is sort of Peter vying for the hearts and the loyalty of these young Christians who are thrown into confusion. And he's trying to get them to follow the teachings of the gospel and Jesus that have been handed down to them from the beginning as opposed to this goofy stuff that was coming in from these false teachers. Well, he does that in three movements and the three chapters of the book pretty much covered these three movements. Though section one only really covers part of chapter one's chapter one. Section one, we're talking first about the action side, obeying Christ and saying faithful to him in your actions, persisting in your faithfulness. And he reminds them of the stuff that he said in his previous letter about how they are fully in God. They are the real deal. They are a part of this big story of redemption and God's people. And here he lists out his own miniature version of Paul's fruits of the spirit that we see at the end of the book of Galatians. And in the context of being the last thing that Peter is going to say to these people, it reads even more beautifully and even more tenderly with him saying, if you get nothing else right, let this be the stuff that is manifest in you for this very reason. Make every effort to add to your faith goodness and to goodness knowledge and to knowledge, self control and to self control, perseverance and to perseverance, godliness and to godliness, brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness love. He and Paul are in lockstep on this and he and Paul are also in lockstep on what this list of virtues means in terms of their strategy. We talked about that when we were looking at first Peter, Jeremiah from the Old Testament, Jesus, who factors pretty prominently in the New Testament, Peter and Paul are all on the same page in saying we're not going to conquer Rome with the sword. We're not going to win some gigantic culture war through deception and manipulation. What we're going to do is faithfully represent Christ and the values of his kingdom while we are in exile, so to speak, in a hostile foreign land and through this salt and light distributed in the middle of this darkness, God will be exalted and people will see the truth of that and respond again. All these virtues that Peter just listed off right here, all the virtues that Paul lists off in Galatians. Those are the ones you would need for this game plan and those are the virtues that are reflective of the values of the kingdom expressed and modeled by Jesus himself. The first movement of this letter then is about staying steadfast in your right action. The second movement in this letter is about being steadfast in right belief. The way that Peter goes at that is to look at a few of the claims that these false teachers have made and then to eviscerate those claims. The false teachers say, Jesus is never coming back. You misunderstood that. He's not actually the king. And Peter says, yes, he is. I saw him in his glory myself and I saw him come back to life. He refutes it with personal testimony. Then the false teachers say, there is no final judgment. Did all get sorted out in this world? And Peter says, no, God will justly judge these false teachers. He will bring it around. And he gives three examples, two of which are in the Old Testament, one of which is peripheral to the Old Testament where Peter seems to be referencing a story from the book of first Enoch. Well, then the false teachers are saying it doesn't really matter what happens with your body because it's all about the spirit anyway. Then Peter says, no, right action is absolutely important. And he calls out the fact that these religious leaders are misconstruing Paul's teaching. He doesn't clarify here in chapter two that he's talking about Paul, but he very much spells it out a little bit later, referencing back to it in chapter three, where he acknowledges even what Paul has written should be thought of as scripture. That's an interesting side note. But Peter says, no, God very much does care about right action. And he very much does call believers to obedience in that regard. And then getting toward the end of chapter two, Peter goes into this robust denunciation of the false teaching and false motives and corrupt character of these religious leaders in a way that is very reminiscent of a verbal beatdown that Peter had a front row seat for in Matthew 23, when Jesus lambasted the religious leaders with the famous seven woes, he declares against them just shortly before he got arrested and went to the cross. And then the third movement in this final work from Peter is all about this Old Testament theme of the day of the Lord. And Peter reminds his audience that God is faithful, that God is patient, that he's drawing more people to himself. He's not just stalling. He's doing this for greater redemptive purposes, but that there will be a day of reckoning. There will be a day when justice happens and all of this gets sorted out. And just from a big picture Bible point of view, I think it's really important that that is coming up again here right at the very end, the closing leg of the race of the whole Bible, because that day of the Lord theme feels like it still hasn't been totally paid off at this point in the Bible. And we're obviously going to get more of that as we get into revelation. The final book of the Bible here in just a little bit. So then Peter, as we know it at least, signs off once and for all saying, therefore dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position, but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever. Amen. And then Peter put his money where his mouth was and he went to his death. When you visualize the book, a second Peter picture Peter in chains. When you think about the theme, reflect on how Peter is saying, following Jesus is costing me, it will cost you and it's totally worth it. So remain faithful to him in action and belief. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get Peter's parting words in chapter three. And now we've collected our level up for second Peter. Next time around, first John, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. This podcast is supported by many of you at patreon.com slash the TMPH podcast.
