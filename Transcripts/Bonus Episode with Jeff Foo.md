 ðŸŽµ Boney's episode, a Boney's episode Of the 10 minute Bible, our podcast It's a Boney's episode, a Boney's episode Of the 10 minute Bible, our podcast Come on now! ðŸŽµ Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible, our podcast bonus episode Because we do that from time to time I think we might even have another one next week So here we are, and by we I also mean Jeffery, Jeff Foote is here, hi Jeff Hi Matt I wanted you to jump on with me for a minute Because a while back we did like a whole big gigantic thing Where we went back and we looked at all the musical nuggets and Easter eggs That you whipped up to make the podcast more fun and interesting We did a whole contest and we gave people prizes And it was epic and you wrote people's songs If they were the winners and could figure out the most Easter eggs And we've done a bunch of that since But we don't really have a contest going And we're probably not going to do a contest for this stretch Yeah, probably not But it's really good stuff, dude, and it makes it really fun And we get episode 747 coming up You have the plan already dialed for that, right? Oh yeah, oh yeah And you probably knew what to do without me telling you, right? Yeah, there's been times where we don't really even need to talk about it We just, we know it's going to be good That makes me happy Do you think music used to be better? I don't know, it's always some good, some bad, but I prefer the old stuff Okay, fair enough Yeah, because it seems like most of the stuff that we do It's a pretty deep callback You pick things from, you know, childhood for us, the 90s, 80s I just think it's a lovely decade for music Like a lovely 15, 20 years span there From somewhere in the 70s to somewhere in the 90s I'm kind of a sucker for it But what do you think made it work so well? Well, I was going to say you hope the good stuff lasts because it's good, right? So if we're throwing back to kind of the obvious stuff Like a couple weeks ago we did Africa for Simon and Cyrene You know, everyone knows Africa You don't have to be our age or grow up in the 80s I think it's just the good stuff is good Can you think of anything that wasn't good from the 80s? Because I can Oh yeah Okay, go, give me some 80s turds Go, let's hear it I want to be a cowboy But boys don't cry Oh, gross That is utter trash What about that? The Tom-Tom Club song Do you think of that as a good song or a horrible song? They needed David Byrne Talking heads without David Byrne, it doesn't work It feels really screwed up, doesn't it? They're doing this work on my house They get this little machine that measures things And anytime when it finally grabs the measurement it goes And I always sit at my desk going And finally the other day This dude, he's been here like I don't know how many times he's like, what are you doing there? You don't know the song? Because listen to your beeper thing, it's like You don't know nothing? That's why I pulled it up and I played it for him And I don't think he was very happy with me Because I think now that stupid riff is a part of his life And he works with that machine Every single day So, yeah, thanks 80s music Other trash, other 80s trash, go, what are you guys? I was just thinking of Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam What was that? No, I don't have that one Head to toe? Oh, yeah, that's awful Yeah, and she's not in key like the entire song No, it's totally flat Yeah Ooh, gross Oh man, that didn't work, I don't know why they kept that Yeah, that was pretty foul I was just having a conversation with a buddy here About the complete and total whiplash you get Listening to where the world Where you go from Like everybody trying to outshine each other But you go from like legitimately phenomenal singers Like Stevie Wonder Or Ray Charles Sure Or Steve Parrish Sure And then it's Bruce Springsteen And Cindy Loper and Bob Dylan Yeah, okay, that's awful If you're paying attention to that kind of thing Yeah, that's 80s drivel as well Okay, so we've been fair We're not totally old music Apologists I think it's like any other era You get some good stuff You get some bad stuff It just feels like there was more awesome happening in that window of time I suppose that's my thesis So there's just a lot of, a lot to draw And I think it's fun And thank you for making the podcast better Obviously, we can't be throwing like dumb joke songs at the end of some of these episodes We're doing right now about the crucifixion and stuffs that feel weird Even though we've had a few that would have really worked Yeah, I almost thought to pitch you a couple times Like some sincere Like old hymns or something I don't know if that fits the tone But we're in that kind of zone right now Well, we did onward Christian soldiers once We definitely did Why are you laughing Jeffrey? Oh, no reason No reason Okay Is it because you mashed it up with poker face by Lady Gaga like a monster? Yes Which was so fitting for your story In that episode It's an abomination And I'm delighted and happy about my part in all of that That's fun Why don't you listen to now music? What's the thinking there? Oh There's just so much With Spotify and Just kind of a De-monetization of music And you can just find tons and tons and tons of subgroups That's what I find So whatever is actually popular in the Bigger culture I'm not going to the places where that would be What people listen to You know, like when we were kids You go to the swimming pool and everybody's playing top 40-80s music You go to the mall Everybody's playing top 40-80s music And now there's not just that one spigot for all music You're right Yeah, I kind of like A lot of things that are coming out right now But nobody else knows any of it And not because like 2004 indie band Well, you just haven't heard of it. It's not like that It's just that there's so much I keep finding cool stuff that I like now And I keep playlists of new stuff that I like And I'm starting this new newsletter thing That this isn't the official announcement But I'm starting a newsletter And I want the newsletter to just be like an email from your friend That's it There you go, doesn't look real corporate It's just I wrote an email this week Here's all the stuff that I made on the internet And also here's some funny things I saw And here's a pretty picture that I saw of a thing that was pretty And made me think about some stuff Also I watched this on TV and it was good You might like it And also what I want to do on there Is the mix tape thing I miss mix tapes When we would record songs off the radio You'd have to wait in your room for hours Until they finally played the one you wanted And you get them all in order And then you give this precious thing to your friend And you're like Hey, these are songs that mean something to me And then you understand each other better And then your friend owes you a mix tape That's right And so I want to use this new newsletter thing that I'm getting started It's kind of like a friends share mix tapes with each other thing with the internet You and I have very diverse musical interests and influences Yep It's not just 80s pop I mean the two of us can go down a lot of rabbit holes On a lot of different musical styles Yeah, we like a lot of different stuff And we like very different things from each other There's a decent shaded amount in our Venn diagram We discovered recently when we tried to make an album together And it was like, huh Yeah, well let's play with the overlap stuff And some of it just doesn't and that's okay So what are some of the differences? Between you and me? Yeah Oh, man, I love four on the floor Pop with a sick hook I think people who are good at music and who like classical music and big band And various styles All of which, I mean both my parents were music majors Vocal and instrumental performance majors They were my music teachers growing up And I was not homeschooled They worked at the school and I took classes from them We did music appreciation Constantly growing up I like a lot of stuff And a lot of people who have appreciation like Like I do in that regard Turn their nose up at pop Like, oh, that's just That's for idiots, that's stupid Anybody could write something like that And I disagree I think it is really hard to write a sick hook Something that just goes straight into your brain on the first try And then you want it again because it's actually fun and good I don't mind stuff that's squared off through the front door Let's just have fun So I think I'm more of a fan of pop than you Fair statement? Fair statement, I do enjoy good pop And I agree with you that Simple and good Is probably the hardest type of song to write But you definitely have more of the country background And I have more of the Prague rock, man Well, that's for sure You were rebellious sooner than I was So you liked more troubling acts in the early 90s Stuff that just Sounded like it was there to just be obnoxious and jab the bear You see the beauty in that And you appreciate that in ways that a lot of people might miss Or other people liked at the time While you were listening to Garth Brooks Garth Brooks on Haddaway and Real McCoy Yeah, that was me, I was doing that Wow, that sounded just terrible I feel like I should feel guilty about that or something But I don't Because I'll tell you what music I listen to La Bouch Whatever I like Oh, yeah, La Bouch, absolutely Wait, which one was La Bouch? That was really popular, was that another night? No, that's Real McCoy Was that Be My Lover? Was that La Bouch? Be My Lover, that's what it is That is trash It's just awful That early 90s Garbage Euro Dance pop phase But it was also catchy, I couldn't help it fun factory I think was in there too Yeah, I listened all At least we can agree Ace of Base Rose above all that On apologetically, I like all the Swedish acts Generally speaking, if you're from Sweden and you made music In English with Americans in mind Even if you're mocking us I don't care Continue the mockery, bring it on I love it Wigwam is my most recent I think they're Swedish I know they're Scandinavians of some sort I think they're Swedes Ace of Base, Rock Set Abba, bring it on man, I love all that stuff I found a lot of bands this year that I really like I found a lot of albums this year that I really liked One of those is called the Clamour and the Crash By a group called Rooktown Have you heard this? Did I share it with you? I have heard it, yes Oh wait, you wrote it and it's your musical pseudonym That's right, you did hear it because you are it It's my band It's really good, dude And I know a lot of people here have listened to it as well And I think it's kind of fun that we have some ownership of that As a podcast community here And I really appreciate those little places Where you let me offer a bit of input here or there But it's not me, that is just all your weird Musical brainchild And for as weird as it is, it's really listenable It's genuinely one of my favorite things that I've heard this year You did provide some good counsel right at the beginning When I was still writing it all, which was Lean into the party rock And lean into the riffs Yeah, still think that Let's turn up the crunch on the guitars, let's write some good riffs And let's make it fun and we put in some horns And we kept it funky Yeah, it's just silly and fun subject matter-wise on the surface But then everything you did lyrically Every song means something and takes us somewhere that matters That premonitions song There's a lot of material from the middle of Matthew in there That was informed by conversations we had on this podcast Particularly about the two separate incidents Where the religious leaders come to Jesus and they demand a sign And Jesus has the exchange with them Where he's like, oh, you guys can read the weather You know that when the sky's a certain color This is what the weather's going to be like How is it then that you cannot see what is plainly unfolding in front of your faces And so it's fun to hear you lyrically riff on that And musically do something super, super cool with that song And then that mystery song that you did at the very end Is just a masterpiece, man, it's like, hmm, thank you 678 completely different movements I mean, it moves like Bohemian Rhapsody Just dramatically jarringly different stuff And it works and really says something And then you get to the very end of that song And I remember the first time I heard it, I was like, Jeff, you just need to stop now You said the thing, and it was great You said a thing about the role of mystery and journey in life And the process of what's entoned is faith and the big questions And you said it, and musically you got it right to the place where you need to land the plane And I remember saying out loud, just land the plane, Jeff, just don't bring it back in Just land the plane, and you did And the whole album just wraps up on that thoughtful, sensitive note I'm like, huh, yeah, nice job, dude, that is, that is ACES Great stuff So nice job, man, congrats on really genuinely a super, super cool album, I've enjoyed it Well, yeah, thanks The music that you wrote, and I think everybody knows this, but I'll just say it again All the music on the front end of this whole Matthew series, that's all from your last album Just little tidbits that we snagged and grabbed onto So people can go and hear the full songs that flow out of that as well on your previous album Which is called, Sea of Tranquility, that's under my name, Jeff Foote, on all the places people listen to music You set such a tone for how I want this to be I do not want to do the podcast where, well, I went to college for this, actually And I read several books, and I have the power of editing and googling And so I can just appear to be completely omniscient about all the things involving the Bible up the top of my head When the truth is, I'm just not I don't want this to feel like a descend from the mountaintop thing because it isn't We're doing the work together, it means that if you're on a journey, you gotta be a little bit lighthearted You can't take yourself too seriously And your music just frames and bookends these conversations So nicely sets the tone in such a good way And the idea that somehow our little conversations that we have here on the daily podcast Somehow informed your much grander artistic achievement on this album That's kind of fun for you to let us think that, so thank you, that is kind of you It is always fun Hey, if you're still listening Thank you for indulging us this It is fun to chat about it, and Jeff is just such a faithful, smart, competent, silent partner on this thing So often, I thought it'd just be fun here to get him on and have him be not so silent to partner on this conversation today So, Jeffrey, thank you for everything you do, thanks for chatting it up with me Yeah, absolutely We're gonna wrap up with one of the songs from Jeff's album And I want it to be the one that I helped you with the most Okay That'll be fun, I got a teeny tiny little bit part helping you make this thing go Do you want to do a casey case some dedication or something? Here's Jeff Foote's band, Rook Town with his hit, premonition from his recent album The clamor and the crash This special dedication goes out, I don't know who it goes out to, I didn't think that far ahead Just play the song I've been down this road before, I know what's behind that door, no one can say No one can say what it is to me, oh, oh There's a sign, the sign says no soliciting Tomorrow's always a mystery And will you find me tonight Watching the flames taking flight What would it mean then in the end To rise above a premonition I see your signs red in the sky Got to do what's right for me and mine Not everything, not everything is heaven I broke a clock for every broken clock and lucky guess There's a thousand disappointments What will you find in the night Watching the flames taking flight What would it mean then in the end To rise above a premonition To rise above a premonition To rise above a premonition I've been down this road for a long time To rise above a premonition To rise above a premonition To rise above a premonition To rise above a premonition To rise above a premonition To rise above a premonition To rise above a premonition
