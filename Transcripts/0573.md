 Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we are at a spot here in Matthew 24 where Jesus is giving what later comes to be known as the Olivet Discourse because it's on the Mount of Olive. See what they did there, Olivette Olive. And in the process of doing so, he is not giving the disciples exactly the answer they wanted, but he's giving them the answer they need to their question of how is everything going to work out? Like what's the timeline on things? How will we know when these big events that you're telling us are still to come are actually going to unfold? And in the first part of the answer is we've looked at very closely, he's saying like, here's a bunch of stuff that's really no sheer sign of anything. This is just history, being history, the world, being the world. You don't even need to panic or do anything. Just be faithful and do the kingdom things that you're supposed to do as my followers under any circumstances. But then in verse 15, seems like he pivots a little bit back toward their original question. And even though he isn't giving them a timeline here or anything neatly chronological, he is saying that one of the indicators of something at least that is really a big deal shaking loose is some kind of abomination occurring in the temple, some kind of profaning or violation of Jerusalem of the temple. And specifically, he says that using this language, Matthew 24 15. So when you see standing in the holy place, the abomination that causes desolation spoken of through the prophet Daniel, let the reader understand, then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. And in Matthew, in most modern translations, that phrase, let the reader understand is set aside by long dashes or hyphens. And it's not in red letters. So it's treated as set apart in the text from the words of Jesus. It's treated as an editorial aside by the person who wrote the book of Matthew. I have every reason to believe is, you know, Matthew. And that phrase has always caught my eye because it's like Matthew is really reiterating what Jesus is saying here, like, Hey, you really want to catch this. There's something super important here. And it's almost like that moment in storytelling where the hero is at the point in their journey, where they could really use one last round of guidance from the mentor or sage character who they've had in their life, but who has now gone. This would be like your Mr. Miyagi or Obi one in the original trilogy or your Dumbledore kind of character. But now that mentor is gone and maybe just for a moment in a movie or a book, they think they hear one last word of wisdom from them or like one thing that they need, but they didn't get all of it. It was in a crowd. It was in a moment. And they're like, wait, come back. What? Let's let the reader understand me. And please, I need you. And it feels almost like that right here as you read through this thing is like, wait, this seems really, really important, but you're not giving me a ton of details. Help me out. What is let the reader understand? Come on. Give me a bit more. But in the conversation today, one I want to look at is the reality that I think we might have what we need to be able to say. Oh, yeah, the reader understands that I think I get what he's driving at here. So clue number one in terms of getting to the bottom of what this sign, this moment is that Jesus says is one specific thing that his disciples should be keeping an eye out for is that he points specifically to the book of Daniel. And there are a few references to things that sound like this back in the book of Daniel, which I totally know where it is and I can just flip there. And I'm obviously not stalling because I bought a microphone and I made a Bible podcast. So I know where things are in the Bible. Ha, there it is right there. Daniel one one in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. Okay, we've heard about this stuff. And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his God in Babylonia and put in the treasure house of God. Well, that sounds like an abomination because Nebuchadnezzar went into the temple into the holy of holies and we're talking about like the special super important golden furniture and furnishings that are in the most holy parts of the temple. Well, that sounds like something of a profaning there and it's how the book of Daniel opens. So this idea of the temple profaned is an important motif in Daniel looking backwards and probably even looking forwards and it's introduced right off the bat. Then we flip over to Daniel chapter five starting in verse two. Now back that up. Let's just start in verse one. King Bel Shazar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them while Bel Shazar was drinking his wine. He gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them. So they brought in the gold goblets that have been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem and the king and his nobles and his wives and his concubines drank from them as they drank the wine. They praised the gods of gold and silver of bronze and iron, wood and stone. And then right after that famously, this is where we get the phrase the writing on the wall. There's literally fingers that appear at this banquet and the text of Daniel says that it wrote on the wall of the royal palace and the king looked and saw the words and he got all frightened and sick and freaked out. And then the king calls in all of his magicians and astrologers and everybody else. And they're like, Oh, it means you're great and super good at things. This is awesome. But then eventually the king calls in Daniel and gets a very different message and Daniel interprets to the writing on the wall as being a condemnation that is born in part out of his father's profaning of the temple and bell Shazar playing along with this profaning of the temple by what he just did at this party. It says Daniel talking to you, his son verse 22 of bell Shazar have not humbled yourself though you knew all this. Instead, you've set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubine strength, wine from them. You praise the gods of silver and gold of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand, but you did not honor the God who holds in his hands, your life and all your ways. Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription. This is the inscription that was written. And I'm going to read that inscription to you here in just a second again. Can you hear me battle him back to coffee again? Sorry about that. I'm hanging in with you here as best as I can. And we got to remember though in order for this to make sense that once again, bell Shazar is held out as being the son, a descendant of Nebuchadnezzar. So these are the Babylonians here, not the Assyrians. The Assyrians came before not the Persians. The Persians come after. These are the Babylonians in Babylon, modern day Baghdad. This is the inscription that was written according to Daniel. Menet, Menet, tekel, parson. This is what these words mean. God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end, tekel. You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting Paris. Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and the Persians. And the text holds out bell Shazar is feeling like, well, I might not like it, but I think that was an honest interpretation of what was there. And then it goes on to say that very night, bell Shazar, king of the Babylonians was slain and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom at the age of 62. Now there are a lot of historical questions there about who identifies or corresponds to extra biblical names of characters at this transition in power that would be super fun to break down. And it's very break downable, but we're going to save that for another time because right now what we're focusing on is this theme in Daniel that Jesus has referenced in Matthew 24 about this abomination that causes desolation, this profaning of the temple as an affront to God. We're talking about how that manifests in Daniel and how the original reader would have understood what Jesus is talking about in Matthew 24. So we've looked at a couple of places in Daniel already where there's a reference to this theme again of profaning the temple. And then if you move over to Daniel nine, and I don't have time to read all of this also, it's just so much to unpack. The second half of Daniel nine in particular gives us this prophecy about this series of intervals of seven that can somehow be measured out to correspond to a bunch of time. There's a lot of debate about exactly what kind of time we're talking about here in chapter nine. But chapter nine of Daniel is dealing with some of the same questions. Like how's this all going to work out? Where is history going that Jesus is dealing with in Matthew chapter 24? And so when Jesus dips back in to Daniel nine for this phrase, abomination of desolation, he's going right back to the same genre he's dealing in. And well, the dots would not have been tough to connect for the original audience, even if it's a little more work for you and me to connect the dots. So somebody is coming along who is supposed to be difficult according to this prophecy. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. This is verse 26 of Daniel nine. The end will come like a flood war will continue until the end and desolations have been decreed. He will confirm a covenant with many for one seven. Again, that's just something we'd have to take more time to break down in looking specifically at Daniel, which we're not going to do right now. In the middle of the quote seven, he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on a wing of the temple, he will set up an abomination that causes desolation until the end that is decreed is poured out on him. Now again, this Persian conquest of Babylon and Daniel serving as a Jewish prophet in the courts of both the Babylonians and the Persians is all set in the second half of the sixth century BC and very clearly, given what you just heard, Daniel with this theme of profaning the temple is looking backwards. He's looking at the moment that he is in and he seems to be prophesying something about it moving forward backwards being Nebuchadnezzar's profaning of the temple carried forward into contemporary times of Daniel with Belchazar's participation in that ongoing profaning and then looking forward in that prophecy. We just looked at in Daniel chapter nine about some future profaning from a yet unnamed character who's going to go and set up an abomination that causes desolation in this holy place in the temple. And next time around, what we need to talk about is what the Jewish people had done with that. So Daniel's looking backwards and talking about profaning the temple. That's easy. It's in the text. The names are there. The dates are there. We know exactly what happened. The part where Daniel's talking about what happened in his lifetime. Well, that's really easy to like writing on the wall. Belchazar, you're out. He died that very night. The Persians took over. Okay. That's pretty straightforward too, but there would have been a lot of questions still hanging out there about like, what was the forward looking part Jewish people at the time of Jesus would have had some debate about when exactly that abomination that leads to desolation was supposed to happen or maybe even believe that it had happened already. Like I said, that's what we're going to break down tomorrow. Consider this a time out. Can you hear the time out? Because I'm making that with my hands really aggressively so you can hear it because because we just have the microphone and no camera. But I want you to experience the time out with me more on this tomorrow. We'll pick up right where we left off. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again.
