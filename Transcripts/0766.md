 Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Do you remember in Gladiator, which I hadn't watched forever and ever and ever, but my kids are old enough now that I was like, all right, let's try it. I'll just fast forward the part where that lady gets cut in half by a chariot and we should be good. And it mostly worked out. The kids aren't too terribly scarred. We were watching Gladiator. We got this scene where the guy who runs the Gladiator outfit. I can't remember his name. Sorry, the pea, maybe he's the old guy, the old veteran used to fight gladiatorial combat and Rome. And now he's got a hot prospect on his hands. It's the general Maximus Meridian is something to something, something lots of Latin sound and things. It's that guy. And he's really good at war because he's a general and he's awesome. And he's dominating in the minor leagues. And then this guy, he calls him up and he's like, all right, look, here's the thing. We're going to go to Rome and I can tell you're mad. You're going to go fight in the big leagues. But you got to understand it's not about the stabbing. It's not about how awesome you are at that. It's about winning the crowd. You got to win the narrative. That's effectively the speech. And I remember watching that as a kid and being like, well, it's kind of about the stabbing though, isn't it? I mean, really at the end of the day, if you're a gladiator and you want to keep gladiating, you just want to stab more than you get stabbed. But then I watched it with the kids the other day. And I was like, dang, that guy whose name I forget, but it starts with the P. He is making a ton of sense. Because in the interim between first time watching it, and now I have come to realize the power of narrative, then probably you have come to realize it too. I mean, if nothing else, the last six or seven years of news has certainly proven to all of us the power of framing the pitch, framing the narrative. We've seen again and again, right? Some kind of news story happens, some incident occurs. And there's this calm before the storm where everybody's like, a thing happened. And it's consequential. But I'm not sure if this helps or hurts my team. I'm going to wait to start blurting out uninformed opinions on the internet and tell the thought leaders, tell me what to think and how this makes the other team look bad. And now I know what the narrative is. And there's this race to figure out who can own the narrative. It doesn't matter what's the true or not in this scenario. It's about what the guy from gladiators said, it's about winning the crowd. It's about winning the opinion. It's about getting that momentum behind you. And that's a very world kingdom set of values. Well, in the book of Matthew, we've got two competing sets of values. We've got the world kingdom set of values, which is the one that you've learned along the way. It's the one that I suppose we all learn to embrace a little bit, just to get by. It's the one that we cynically acknowledges there. But what's anybody going to do about it? We just put our heads down and get on with life. You got that world kingdom set of values when it comes to truth and power and controlling people and the point of life. And that's exemplified by the enemies of Jesus, even though they're religious people, everybody was religious at this point, even though they're religious people, they're religious people who are advocating world kingdom values under a thin veneer of vaguely theistic God sounding stuff. And then you got Jesus with the kingdom values stuff. And we see him introduce these concepts in his first big recorded public appearance in the sermon on the Mount Matthew chapters five through seven. And then he chases that description of the values and the point of this very different kingdom with a whole bunch of living out and doing stuff and breaking the laws of time and space to demonstrate what this truer, greater, realer kingdom looks like. And so Jesus is kingdom, guy, then the religious leaders as enemies are world kingdom guys, manipulative aggressively, deceptively control the narrative because people are idiots to be controlled. And if you can win the crowd, you can win whatever you want is a world kingdom value. And here in Matthew 27, we're going to see that these very world kingdom savvy religious leaders are not entirely at peace with the Jesus thing, even though he has just been killed by professional executioners who have indeed verified that Jesus is dead. They're still strategizing here because they know the power of narrative and they do not want some kind of narrative from beyond the grave to prop Jesus back up religious weekend at Bernie style and cause some kind of sympathy or following that could threaten their power. They've worked so hard to defend. So what are we not so far? Matthew 27 57 gets us into that Joseph of Verimithia business. We were talking about last week, he and Nicodemus, according to John, that doesn't come up in Matthew, they partner up to be like, all right, enough's enough. This is the moment where we got to kind of take our public stand. And we are throwing in with dead Jesus because we are we're betting he's coming back to life. Big, bold, dangerous move on their part, something where overwhelmingly, you're going to lose that bet historically, but they see something in Jesus and they think it's legit. Joseph Verimithia goes to pilot asks for the body pilots like yeah, whatever fine, great, take it maybe under the advisement of that centurion who was very changed by the whole execution affair. And it's like, I pilot seriously like man to man professional advice here. You do not want to mess with this anymore. Something is up with it. Maybe that's how that went down. I certainly came away with that impression after going and looking at the parallel accounts in other gospels with you the other day. And then ponches pilots, I find take the body. And so just Verimithia and Nicodemus, they take the body and they wrap him up and linen cloth and they put him in a new tomb that nobody's ever been in before that apparently belongs to Joseph of Verimithia. And all of this is witnessed by two witnesses who've been reliable and faithful and loyal the whole time, not witnesses who are manipulated or pressured through their own cowardice. These are very brave people. And that is verse 61, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary. They are present and they're sitting the whole time that all of this is taking place. They're watching the preparation of the body. They are there opposite of the tomb. Watch and like hawks. This is where we get into the contrast between the kingdom kingdom read on this narrative on this moment and the world kingdom read on this narrative on this moment. The ladies, Joseph of Verimithia and Nicodemus, weird that it's people who for the most part haven't really come up through a narrative. No Peter, no John, even they're all doing something different, not even Matthew's right in the book and given accounting of him being present for this. But this unlikely group of heroes of kingdom, value, kingdom, citizen types, they're taking this big risk and they are there because they think the narrative is Jesus is going to be handed over to the chief priests and the elders, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, he's going to be executed. And on the third day, he's going to be raised back to life. That's what they think the narrative is going to turn out to be and they want to watch it. They want to be there for it. But on the other side, verse 62, the next day, the one after preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees also went to pilot also is my little italicized edition there. I add that little italicized paraphrase also because I think Matthew is again trying to draw a contrast here. This is a technique he uses editorially throughout the book. And I think the contrast is between the kingdom kingdom narrative people who go to pilot and the world kingdom narrative people who go to pilot. Why did the kingdom kingdom people go to pilot? Well, because they think it's all true. And they think that Jesus body shouldn't be disregarded and mistreated and to be consigned unceremoniously to some mass grave. Now we get the world kingdom people approaching pilot and they come up and they're like, sir, they said, we remember that while he was still alive, that deceiver said, after three days, I will rise again. So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he's been raised from the dead. And this last deception would be worse than the first. Matthew's presentation of these guys paints them as dripping with deception. And that's consistent with how they've been presented throughout the fact that Jesus goes to the cross at their behest, would seem to support Matthew's read on that. But do you notice how eager they are to preserve Pontius Pilate's dignity and to defend the truth? There's just been some lion going on around here, Pontius Pilate. And as people who love the truth, maybe the most of all, we just couldn't bear to see another horrible deception, perhaps the worst one of all. We're going to need to make sure nothing goes down here. And so unwittingly, what they think they're doing is narrative control work. They're going to have the vouch of a Roman guard to prevent any shenanigans and to serve as witness to say, yeah, nothing happened. So we get a contrast of two witnesses who are going to be stationed at the tomb. Then you see what Matthew is doing here? It's pretty nifty. The narrative witnesses number one, Mary and the other Mary, they're there the whole time watching the whole thing happened because they have a kingdom narrative perspective on this, which the scriptures hold out as being the true read on all of this. Then you've got the deceptive read on all of this and you got two witnesses there as well. They're going to be Roman guards. So both sides have made moves to safeguard the narrative. But the interesting thing that's going to happen here that I think is so cathartic to imagine happening in this world is that for once, it's not going to be some silly narrative battle where some people are like, no, that wasn't what was said. It was actually the other party who did that and inflicted those injustices. No, it was not. It was you who did it. Well, let's go back and look at the receipts. That's the kind of nonsense narrative squabbling that we see all the time now. And truth just goes through the ringer here. It's not going to come down to a silly little narrative battle. It's going to come down to in the mind of Matthew and in the mind of the original audience. Well, did that guy come back to life? Because if he did and anybody saw that, it kind of settles it. So we're getting all the dance steps of a narrative battle here between a kingdom, kingdom narrative and a world kingdom narrative. And it's setting up for a very satisfying conclusion for the person who's reading the book of Matthew and is convinced like the centurion and so many others that Jesus is who he says he is and that what's going on here is going to change the course of all of history. I saw a couple more you were kind enough to write reviews on your various podcast apps. That helps a ton and getting the word out it signals to those different podcasting apps so that people listen to this and that they like it and that other people might like it. And so those reviews are about much more than the obvious encouragement that it provides to me. That's also a simple thing that you can do if you want to to help get the word out about this podcast and invite more people to the conversation or you could also not which is also cool. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. you
