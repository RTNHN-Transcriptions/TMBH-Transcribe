 Do you remember way, way back at the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Robert Downey Jr. was stealing our hearts with his charm and his wit and his arrogant guy but with a heart of gold archetype that would be imitated with literally almost every other Marvel character that would come thereafter. But it was awesome in Iron Man. Do you remember when it got to the end and you're like, ah man, I know the beats of how these secret identity superhero movies go. It's like, we as the audience, we get to be in on the secret. That's pretty fun. But all of the stujas in the show, they don't know. And so one of the big plot points is going to be like, who is Iron Man? And everybody has to wonder and he has to do what it takes to defend and hide his secret identity. That's so fun. Yeah, let's do this as a whole franchise. And he's up there at the podium and he's got his little notes. He's like, yeah, you know what? Actually, I'm Iron Man. It's like, ah, that's great. One, because it's different and it bucked the trend too because it's in keeping with the comic books. Everybody in the comic books knows Tony Stark is Iron Man. And three, because it totally fits with his character. Like, come on. I'm Iron Man. I have a role to play here. And now is the time when it is appropriate for you to know exactly who it is. It's me. Look, I ain't saying Jesus of Nazareth is Iron Man. Gets better than that. It's better set up than that in the book of Matthew, even though I did think Iron Man was, you know, was a cinematic achievement. It was a good show. Bibles, even better Matthews, even better. The way it relates to the Old Testament is even better, but that was such a wonderful punctuation moment on that whole Iron Man build right there at the end of the story. And if you think about it, we haven't really had the truth is I am Iron Man moment yet from Jesus. In fact, critics of Christianity and the Bible, which is always funny to me. Like, I totally get, you could dig deep into the Bible and be like, I looked really, really closely at it. And I don't know. There's still just too many existential and philosophical questions that I have to be. Sure enough, that there's a God for me to take the leap and dedicate my life to such a God to the pursuit or advancement of the values of such a kingdom. I just can't do it. Okay. People have different thresholds of belief. I get it. But some of the lazy haven't read the Bible criticisms of the Bible. Man, those, those, I'm a little less sympathetic toward, I think. And one of the worst of those is the ones where people are like, well, he never, he never said that he was the son of God or God in the flesh. Like he didn't say that. Like, oh, wow. But he totally did. In every way imaginable, short of just standing up like a proud, arrogant Tony Stark and saying, the truth is I am the son of God. The truth is I am God in the flesh. Well, that's what a Tony Stark would say, who's here a little bit to be served and adored by his fans and his minions. And Tony Stark, you know, a little bit came to serve others, but also really wants to be served too. Well, son of man didn't come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many Tony Stark and Jesus of Nazareth are not the same character. And in the same way that it was absolutely in keeping with the character of Tony Stark to be like, I am Iron Man. So it really wouldn't be in keeping with the character of the incarnate Christ to get up in front of everybody at a big Roman corporate press conference and be like, I am the son of God. You know, it's true. Cause I said so. Look at me. I can back that up. This isn't his style. Does he affirm it? Yeah. Does he say it? Kind of does right here in the passage that we're looking at. Like he, he affirms his role in a way that everyone in the original audience would have known exactly what he meant, but he doesn't do it like Tony Stark. He does it like Jesus of Nazareth, who is on mission to accomplish the things that he said he's on mission to do. I'm talking too much without reading the verse. I do that sometimes stupid. Street the first. Okay. Here we go. Matthew 26 verse. Nah, I'm going to back it up. Matthew 26 verse 62. Let's start here. Jesus says, Kiphus stood up and said to Jesus, are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you? And you remember this was them saying that Jesus supposedly said he was going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, but Jesus remained silent as we discussed in fulfillment of stuff in Isaiah 53, then the high priest still Kiphus said to him, I charge you under oath by the living God. Tell us if you are the Christ, the son of God. And as we discussed, Jesus had thoughts about oaths and how things ought to be in that regard. And whatever those thoughts were, it was something that was entirely saturated in kingdom values. He thought about oaths in that context, make of it whatever you will. When he spoke about oaths, he pointed somewhat vaguely, but it was there to Christology stuff about the nature of Christ himself. But here he's not going to be discreet. This is about as much of an iron man moment as you are going to get. He's saying it not in the far off reaches of the far north up where that campfire was, where Peter rightly identified him as Christ and Matthew 16. Now he's saying it in the house of the high priest with witnesses present to everything being recorded. This is legally binding verse 64. This is in red. Yes, it is as you say Jesus replied. So again, to the, I'm sure well intentioned, but frustratingly ill prepared critic of the Bible and Jesus who's like, yeah, the Bible doesn't, he never even said he was the son of God. I repeat, tell us, are you the Christ, the son of God? And then Jesus says, yes, it is as you say. So I think that counts. Like, I think that's Jesus saying, yep. Do you notice that again, he's using that, you said it kind of language. I mean, he just did that right with Judas. What is it? Just one page ago and chapter 26 is law on working this through. Then Judas, the one who would betray him said, yeah, verse 25, surely not I rabbi. Jesus answered, yep, it's you or you said it. You have said so even. So twice that terminology comes up when somebody says a thing that is true in Matthew 26, we have firms that think about this, that he is the Christ, the son of God. He just owned it and he owned it in front of people who he knows will kill him for saying that. But he can back and look at everything he did. Look at everything that's happened. Look at all of the things that he's taught. Look at all of his ability to break the laws of time and space. Look at his relationship with the father. Like at some point, if you're reading this thing through for the first time and you don't know anything about it and you're some relatively close to the original audience level member and you're reading through it. You go along and you're like, I hope it's him. I really want him to be that and it looks from chapter 16 like he is, but I don't know. Anybody can say anything in a circle of friends who are maybe a little sycophantic and we'll just go along with whatever. But here he's saying it on record and he's saying it to people who are going to kill him for saying it. Yeah, he's the Christ that is the Messiah, the son of God, meaning that what he just said to them is, yes, I am the one about whom all of history speaks. I am the centerpiece of history and existence. I am the thin spot between God and man. I am God in the flesh. I am the suffering servant. They knew Isaiah 53, meaning that what he is saying is that what you are doing right now is what the bad guys do in Isaiah 53. That is also implicit in what he's saying. I am the way, the truth in the life. I am the bread of life. I am all the things that he says over in John that he is. I am. I mean, like essence, it's like the name of actual God. He said it seven times in John. And now here he's confirming it. And the scary thing is that there'd been a whole lot of messianic claimants who got up just like Tony Stark. We're like, I'm the Messiah. We looked at a bunch of them over on the YouTube channel. You should go check out that video if you haven't. I cover a ton of these rival messiahs. It's the thumbnail. If you can't find it from last summer, it's thumbnail with the guy with glasses on. It says Carl and he's a fake messiah. There's a painting. It's a great thumbnail. My favorite thumbnail I've maybe ever made. You should check it out just for that if nothing else. But all of these rival messiahs who made big giant Tony Stark style claims, they could not back it up. Come on. Pilot broke up one of these. Cabals that had come together with a couple of soldiers and some spears. Other guys got arrested out in the desert. Other people just went out and were like, Oh, I'm in trouble with the government. Cause I said it was the messiah. I'll go live in a cave. And then you know, when we heard from them again, never, they just. Went away with the slightest bit of pressure. None of them broke the laws of time and space, let alone broke the laws of time and space in front of a good, Jillian witnesses. Both friendly and hostile, even witnesses who hated the way he broke the laws of time and space so much that they told him to go away because they were freaked out about it and didn't know what to make of it. This guy, Jesus of Nazareth, he's scary. Cause when he says, yeah, it says, you say I am the Christ, the Messiah, the son of God. That's the question he's answering. He can back it up. This is the biggest, most dramatic moment in the whole gospel of Matthew. So far. This is the payoff that everybody's waiting for. You've been around this forever. You've been saturated. You've brined in a society that is soaked in this story. So you know this moment's coming. Maybe even read Matthew before. So you know this moment is coming, but to the original audience or to the actual humans who were there as this was playing out, ba, ba, ba. This was the big moment. There it is. Black and white, red and white as it is here. Spelled out for everybody to hear the implications of this. Of course, are massive. It's as simple as this. If what Jesus said right there, what he affirmed, if it is true, then God made the universe and everything in it. And then God chose a people with whom to create a relationship to demonstrate his character throughout the centuries and to demonstrate human need for God to conquer our greatest weaknesses, that being sin. And death, the enemy within the enemy without it means that God allowed human kingdoms to exist so we could see how those always break and always fail and always turn to injustice and lack of provision and evil and lust for blood so that he could contrast it with what an actual kingdom looks like with actual kingdom values that are eternal. And lasting. It means that God allowed a gajillion run of the male clown kings to come and go to mock the idea of real authority and kingship so that we could see what a real king looks like when he shows up right here. It means to quote Han Solo that it's all true every last bit of it. If what Jesus said here, it's as simple as a yes or no, a one or a zero. This is a binary question. If what he said is true, it's all true. All of the big grand narrative that is held out here in the Bible about what God is doing and his redemptive work and Christ being the centerpiece of it. You can debate passages here and there or whatever, but the big thrust of the story, it's real. It's true. Oh, oh, look, it's my kids. They're calling. Hang on a second. I'm going to wrap up this thought. You just a minute. Let me see what's going on here. Hello. Hey. I'm going to be kiddo. OK, bye. Yeah, it's good that my daughter called. I was getting excited and going on and on, but it is exciting because this is the big moment. This is the drama right here. He said it and we need to think about the implications of what he just said yes to and what he says and follow up to saying, yes, he is the Christ and the son of God next time around. Also, you remember that music thing that I said that we were working on that I was going to tell you more about that I'm really proud of and excited about? Oh, yeah, that's still happening. And you can go listen to that at Spotify. Also, we're going to continue to bounce individual tracks to all of the patrons of the program at patreon.com slash the TmVH podcast. It's so good. I don't feel cocky saying that because I'm not responsible for why it's so good. Jeff has made a genuinely fantastic piece of art here and I want you to listen to it. I hope you buy copies of the CD. I don't get anything for that. It's just I believe in it that much. And I hope you share it with friends because it's legitimately awesome, thoughtful music in a way that you just don't hear very often anymore. So yeah, once again, the climber in the crash, Jeff did that. His band name is Rooktown and so dang good. And also, man, I'm excited to keep going on Matthew 26. We are into the good stuff. All right, more next time I'm Matt. This is 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
