 Here's one of the things that I'm just loving about this passage, we're looking at Matthew 27 with Joseph Verimathea and all the details Matthew is giving about who collected Jesus' body and where the burial is happening. What I love about it is just how tangible this would have been for the original audience. Jesus is actually dead. He is actually getting buried. You know, sometimes they wrap people up in sheets if they do a nice burial for him. Well, guess what? That is exactly how Jesus got buried. You know how whenever the Romans crucified people in Judea, there was always a question of, yeah, what are you going to do with the body? Well, that has been answered. Here's what's happening with the body. Here is whose tomb that body is going in. All of these details are here and that creates a sense of proximity for that original audience member who can go and tangibly encounter these things. They could go to that tomb. They could find out exactly which cave, which carved out chunk of rock this is and go to it. They could go find Joseph Verimathea. Well, maybe they could if they were reading this a couple of decades later. But if the legends of the Middle Ages about Joseph Verimathea are to be believed, then maybe they couldn't because maybe he was off gallivanting around Europe somewhere burying grails more on that in a minute. Hey, you know what I didn't mention? My name is Matt and this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and I'm super, super glad that you're here. We're working our way through the book of Matthew, one little chunk at a time. And then when we're done with that here in about a month and a half, starting on January 2nd, we are going to start going through the Bible one day, one book for the first quarter of next year. And it's going to be delightful. Back to Joseph Verimathea. Let's go and look at what else we know about him from the Bible before we get into some of those medieval myths and legends that came along later. Mark 15 42. It was preparation day. That is the day before the Sabbath. So as evening approached, Joseph Verimathea, a prominent member of the capital C council who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God went boldly to pilot and asked for Jesus body. Pilot was surprised to hear that he was already dead, summoning the centurion. He asked him if Jesus had already died when he learned from the centurion that it was so he gave the body to Joseph. So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid. So we're getting some new stuff here from Mark. Apparently, Jesus died quickly by comparison and pilot was a little surprised by how quickly he died. He had that centurion. Presumably that would be the centurion who said surely this is the son of God. He had that guy come in and vouch. Was there anything going on there in that unspoken dynamic where the centurion was like, yeah, he died. And also it's weird, man. It's weird. They don't mess around with this. And maybe in that unspoken vouch, that was what was enough for pilot to be like, yeah, I wondered if there might be something up here. I'm not giving that body to his accusers. I'm giving that to whoever this guy is. Yeah, sure, Joseph, you can have the body. Or is it possible that what we're learning here is that pilot and Joseph Haverimathea knew each other? Now, Mark says that it was bold for Joseph to go before pilot, probably not like Esther before Xerxes kind of bold, but it had been a hard day for pilot and this guy is under pressure and duress. He Joseph Haverimathea understood some of that politically. And as we hype up that a size yesterday, just wanted to take some of the pressure off of a pilot and it provided a great out. Maybe as we're hypo thethesizing today, something about the look in the centurion's eye or what he signaled to pilot told him, just give it to Joseph and be done with this. Truly wash your hands of it. You want nothing more to do with this situation. Either way, Mark's account squares with Matthew that Joseph gets the body and he wraps the body and linen and he puts him in the tomb. But let's go back to that capital C council thing. Joseph Haverimathea, a prominent member of the council. Well, what council? Why wouldn't you clarify that? Wouldn't they be talking about the council? Everybody would know like the Sanhedrin? It seems like Mark is suggesting that Joseph Haverimathea is kind of like another Nicodemus character. I don't think he's come up in our conversations at all. But the most famous verse maybe in the entire Bible, John 3 16 is delivered from Jesus to a member of the Sanhedrin or a Pharisee at least who has under the cover of darkness come to Jesus to be like, Hey, you seem legit. What's the deal with all of this? And Jesus said, the stuff about you forgot so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, all of that business. Well, is it possible that it wasn't just Nicodemus who was persuaded by the things that had happened with the life and teachings and death of Jesus? Is it possible that there's another member of the Sanhedrin who wasn't yelling crucify him crucify him? And that Joseph Haverimathea is indeed that. Let me put it this way. If Joseph Haverimathea is the member of some other council that Mark is referring to here, I don't know what that council would be. And if I don't know and you don't know, and nothing else springs to mind immediately, then probably we are talking about another Nicodemus here. We are talking about another member of the Sanhedrin, the religious ruling class that looked at Jesus and was like, this guy seems legit. And notice also the language who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God. He understands that this is a kingdom. He understands a lot of the stuff that was revolutionary when Jesus is saying it back in the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5 through 7. Remember, Jesus comes out. He gives this manifesto of the kingdom. And even that as a set of categories to think about the stuff of God seems to have been a little bit foreign to your average citizen of Galilee, even your religious leaders at the time. But Joseph Haverimathea got it. So does that mean that Joseph Haverimathea is kind of half Anna and to Simeon, who remember at the beginning of Luke, we looked at this a few days ago, put their blessing on little baby Jesus and we're like, Oh, praise God, you've allowed my eyes to see your salvation. The salvation of Israel is here. I mean, they'd been attentively waiting for the kingdom for the king all this time and they knew it when they saw it. Is it possible that Joseph Haverimathea then is half Anna and Simeon and half Nicodemus? Oh, no, I just think it's interesting that we're getting a closer look at what this guy actually believed. It's so funny that I thought we were going to get into relics and medieval myth and legend and all of this stuff this time around. We're not going to do that, but we are going to get more from the Bible, Luke 23. And I don't know this. I've stopped my head. I got a look versus 50 through 56. It looks like. All right, here we go. Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the council says it again. Now a lot of people think that one of the sources that Luke references at the beginning of the book of Luke when like a good historian, he lays out who he's citing or rather what his methodology was and gathering information. A lot of people, I think rightly believe that one of Luke's sources would have been Mark or Mark and Peter. And so it's no surprise that his details would line up with what we read in Mark. A member of the council, a good and upright man who had not consented to their decision and action. So my theory from a minute ago when we were talking about Mark that this would have been one of the members of the Sanhedrin who didn't yell crucify him crucify him is confirmed here in Luke that he did not consent to the action. And the fact that Luke phrases it this way means that council call that much more. It's got to refer to the Sanhedrin, right? It's got to refer to the council of religious leadership. He came from the Judean town of Aramathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. Same language that Mark used going to pilot. He asked for Jesus body, then he took it down, wrapped it in the linen cloth. That detail again, placed it in a tomb, cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. Matthew used the term new. Luke is saying not only is it new, but like nobody's even been in there. It was preparation day and the Sabbath was about to begin. And then it says that the women were there also and that they saw that his body had been placed in it. Interesting stuff. Over to John. We get our Joseph of Aramathea stuff in chapter 19 verses. It's got to look again. I don't know this 38 through 40 later. Joseph of Aramathea asked to pilot for the body of Jesus. Now, Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews with pilots permission. He came and took the body away. He was accompanied by a ha, Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night, recorded here in the book of John. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about 75 pounds, taking Jesus body. The two of them wrapped it with the spices and strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs at the place where Jesus was crucified. There was a garden and in the garden, a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid because it was the Jewish day of preparation. And since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there. I think we're getting a pretty robust picture of who this guy is. And is it an interesting though? We don't really get enough from any single account to flesh out the character and the pressures he's feeling and his motivations. But when you line up all four, wow, we see a picture of somebody who's in a horrible political position, but who is operating in a way that he was almost like a mole. He was someone who had infiltrated the Sanhedrin, but was persuaded by the position, the character, the testimony of the Sanhedrin of his own counsel's sworn enemy. And then finally, when everything comes to a head and the cross happens, Joseph of Arimathea, along with Nicodemus, they're not in hiding anymore. They fear the Jews. Yeah, as well, they should look what they just did to Jesus. But there's no way that what they're doing here, claiming the body and burying him in a tomb associated, they owned deeded to Joseph of Arimathea. There's no way that's going to stay silent. So Nicodemus and Joseph are putting their necks on the line at this point. And maybe this is where we need to wrap up. But what a bold move at this moment. The dividends haven't been paid yet. Crazy stuff happened around the crucifixion enough to compel some witnesses to be like, dang, I think that's the son of God. But they're betting on somebody coming back to life. They're placing their chips on that particular tile. Are you kidding me? That's a very high risk bet because of how much dead people normally stay dead. But that is how convinced these two very learned people with so very much to lose are about Jesus being the Christ, the Messiah, the son of God. And I'm telling you, if they don't think Jesus is coming back to life, these moves, they're making don't make any sense. They are getting in on the ground floor. So to speak, they are lining themselves with a dead messianic claimant while that claimant is dead on the belief that he is coming back to life that I should ever experience a faith so genuine and so well grounded as these two guys. Very, very compelling. We're still going to talk about relics. We're still going to talk about legends and myths in the middle ages. And it's going to be fun, but that's going to happen next time around. Very quickly as we wrap things up, we had a conversation here a couple weeks ago on a Saturday bonus episode about where things are going on the YouTube channel and here at the podcast and other stuff. I just put out a video announcing that on the YouTube channel side and that's news to a lot of people over there because they're not over here on the podcast as well. It would help me out a ton and I would be so grateful if even though you can already get the drill because you're here and you're ahead of the game, it would still be very helpful if you would go and watch that video or even if you don't want to watch it, just play it through. That helps the YouTube algorithm know that it needs to put that in front of a larger percentage of the subscribers over there. And so yeah, if you'd be willing, that would be a huge help. If not, guess what? It's totally cool. Anyway, I'm Matt, this is 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
