 Hey, my friends, it's Matt, the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. I'm back at my house, my microphone back, and it sounds better, it sounds better, right? Hopefully it sounds better. Because yesterday I held my cell phone to my mouth in a hotel courtyard, and I think all things considered, it came out, you know, I listened to it. Pretty good-ish. It mostly worked. Thanks for your patience with that. I'm really delighted by the fact that we have been able to put out an episode every single weekday since October of 2019 when we started. We maybe straight up took Christmas week off that first year, but then I looked at the numbers and I was like, oh my goodness, if I take a week off, like with just nothing, I think people kind of forget, I should never do that again. So maybe we took that week off. I think maybe we did. But other than that, you know, you're kind of pulling out every day. It's what we do. Like we're having a conversation, we're working on a thing together. This is fun. This is part of my rhythm. Hopefully it's part of your rhythm. So I don't want to miss it. And my travel, I was out filming videos for the YouTube channel. Got extended a little bit, and so you got to do what you got to do. Thank you for your grace with that. Thank you also for your grace and your patience and your benefit of the doubt when I think things you don't think. And I laugh at jokes. You don't laugh at when I watch programs that for whatever reason you wouldn't watch or did watch and didn't like, you've always been real cool to me about that. And I'm going to have to depend on that goodwill a bit more as I talk about this little thing as we get into Matthew 27 today. Game of Thrones was a show on HBO. I don't recommend it. Sometimes I say that tongue in cheek and deep down. I'm like, no, seriously, they'll probably go watch it. And it's just kind of tongue in cheek and you do with it what you will. This one, like no, straight up Bible podcast. I do not recommend that you go and watch Game of Thrones. It is as shocking as you've heard, especially in the early seasons. My skin is thick. My offendability ratio is such that I'm pretty hard to a Paul, but this show tip toed right up to that line and even crossed it a few times for me. But even more offensive to me than all of that shocking stuff. And wow, was it shocking at times? Is how much season eight it broke from all the storytelling style and approach and the way chronology was handled. They just pitched everything about who the characters were and where they were going and how you pay off a character arc. And so it felt gross. It felt like somebody else wrote the last part. It felt like the thing got sold out and thus the very negative reaction. What went wrong was that you had one set of ground rules for how you tell the story. You had a purpose that had become very evident for where this thing was going and then you just broke from it and the new purpose became get it over with. When we look at the book of Matthew, we can tell pretty early on with even a casual glance that what we're doing here is not what Game of Thrones was setting out to do, which is to tell a cohesive chronological narrative without a ton of value judgments. It's a little bit morally murky that causes you to wrestle with the dankness of humanity and the human soul and politics. Whereas here with the Bible, there's a good and bad. It's pretty clear what's going on with Matthew. This is a story of Jesus life. It's not a comprehensive biography. We skip three decades in the middle of the story. We skip all kinds of interesting or important details that we would have loved to have known. No doubt. No, rather, Matthew is doing a thing. He's giving us the details about Jesus story in the order it makes sense to deliver them in order to speak to a first century Jewish minded audience to convince them that Jesus is the fulfillment of all of the law and the prophets and predictions that had come before in what we call the Old Testament and that he is indeed the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of God, God in the flesh, the long-promised King of the long-awaited kingdom who will sit on the throne of David and reign forever and who will establish a new family of faith that transcends the old ethnic boundaries. That's what Matthew is trying to accomplish. And from time to time, as he does this, he makes it clear that he's willing to go outside of chronology as need be to arrange the story in such a way so as to pay off the Old Testament stuff and see through those themes and that purpose. One is a dramatic political retelling of history. The other is a theological biography meant to point people toward right belief in Christ's recognition of Christ as the Messiah and the Son of God. So when Matthew deviates from chronology, I understand how the outside critic might look at that and be like, wait a day, minutes, some of the other accounts of Matthew, they have that order a little bit different. That's messed up. What gives? Well, what gives is that none of them have made it clear that what they're doing is a slabishly chronological telling of the story. And unlike Game of Thrones, we're jumping all over the place in season eight with travel times that make no sense and making things happen in a way that is a chronological mess. Here that chronological flexibility actually serves the purpose. And if we bear that in mind, then when we get to Matthew 27 and we start thinking about the flow of time here narratively, we don't need to be troubled by it. It might look troubling at first glance, but it makes sense when you put your brain to it. Here's what I mean. Jesus and the disciples are on the Mount of Olives, the Garden of Gethsemane. And then the arrest happens. And then Jesus gets taken from just picture it like a clock. Let's say the south end of the city of Jerusalem is the six o'clock. The north end is 12 o'clock. The Garden of Gethsemane then is outside the walls of the old city of Jerusalem. And it's at like three o'clock. That's where all of the garden stuff in the prayer and all of that business happens, the arrest. Then Jesus gets taken inside the clock somewhere in the neighborhood of the three o'clock range. That would be where the temple complex and stuff was. But first he gets taken to more like six o'clock, which would be where the Sanhedrin met and where the palace of the high priest is, Caiaphas. So we have this little Kangaroo Court trial there that we've been looking at. At the end of that time, Jesus is taken here in 27 verses one and two early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. They bound him, led him away and handed him over to pilot the governor. Now they're taking him closer to three o'clock. So kind of back in the direction of the garden, the Mount of Olives, but we're still well inside the walls and adjacent to the temple right now. And what you will notice here is there's not really any window of time then from the arrest outside the clock on the three o'clock side to the movement to the trial inside the clock around the six o'clock spot to being handed over to pilot inside the clock around the three o'clock spot for any kind of lengthy deliberation about money and bounties and buying fields. It just doesn't make any sense. So we read that stuff, but then the next thing in the narrative is when Judas who'd betrayed him saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned to the 30 silver coins of the chief priests and elders of Cindy said, for I betrayed innocent blood, what's that to us? They reply this your responsibility. So Judas threw the money into the temple and left, then he went away and hanged himself. Obviously, there's a lot to unpack there. We've got a few days to do that. Nobody was going to the temple there. I mean, we're still in the morning here. There's no opportunity for this to unfold, but unlike Game of Thrones, where you're breaking all the rules to start messing with the timeline, the gospels have always been flexible with the timeline. Sometimes it's more evident that that's happening as is the case in, what would that be Luke chapter three at the end of Jesus baptism when it jumps right ahead to John criticizing Herod and then Herod adding this to all of his other wickedness. He arrested John and killed him. Well, Matthew gives us a different timeline there as well. And whereas Luke's telling that is an obvious chronological aside, Matthew's telling of those events in chapter 14, aren't necessarily in chronological order, but it fits there a little more naturally. And so even if some of the events surrounding the end of 13 and what happens in 14 might not be exactly in that order, it flows for what Matthew's trying to accomplish. A casual reading wouldn't even raise a question like, okay, well, now this just happened next. Here in chapter 27, what we're getting is I think the equivalent of what Luke did with the Herod story is just a very obvious aside. Clearly we're still fully in the flow of Jesus arrest, but we got to wrap up the Judas thing kind of like we needed to wrap up the Peter thing. I mean, it seems like the best way to tell the story would just be Jesus got arrested, then he went here, then he went here, then he went here, then he went here, then he went here, then he got crucified, but you got these other character arcs that you need to wrap up. So if you're Matthew, do you wrap up Peter and Judas like after the ascension and the Great Commission at the end of Matthew? Okay, so then all this stuff happened. There's your big climax. There's the big point. And now here's a weird epilogue also. You might remember Peter. Well, let's go back to the night that Jesus was arrested. Peter was jerk and he ran out and he wept bitterly. And then, you know, Judas later he came back and it just feels like the white print on black that's always unsatisfying at the end of a movie that says what everybody ended up doing afterwards. And that frankly kind of detracts from the punch of the final scene. So Matthew makes the editorial decision to close out those two character arcs right here so that everything that needs to be paid off from our ancillary characters is paid off before we really get down to the nitty gritty with Jesus. That's what I think is going on here. So whereas we might from time to time see movies or TV shows or read a book where the a chronological stuff is kind of unsatisfying and comes out of the clear blue sky, especially because those stories are holding themselves out as being chronologically precise. In the same way that a story that breaks its own rules might be unsatisfying. So another story that's willfully out of order and totally transparent about the goals, the automatically it's trying to accomplish such a story like that going out of order can be very satisfying as well. Matthew is the latter kind of story. And here again, he is exercising that to pay things off in a very responsible way that allows us to focus fully on Jesus, even though pretty clearly the Judas thing must have happened a little later on. We'll break down exactly what that Judas stuff looked like next time around a mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
