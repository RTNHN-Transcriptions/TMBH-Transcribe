 Hey my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and for those of you who are new, first of all for those of you who are new, welcome. Thank you for jumping in. I've heard about it. I am crazy grateful that you're here and we're talking about this stuff. I love the fact that whoever you are, you are not exactly like me and I have found it super fun and energizing to talk about something that for whatever reason often causes us in our insecurity to move into little camps and avoid other camps and just hunker down and think together and make sure we get all our ducks in a row. I have an adult opportunities in my life to talk about God and the Bible and faith before this with people who aren't like me and so hey thanks for being here at one. Thanks for caring about the same stuff that I do. And three, thanks for being willing to hang out with someone who's different from you. You being here speaks in my mind positively about who you are and I'm grateful to you. I am also grateful to you, those of you who are new and those of you who have been here for a while because you are forcing me to work very, very, very hard on the Bible because this is much harder than I thought it was going to be and it has been humbling more on that stuff in a minute. But for those of you who are new, you probably caught back there at the beginning of my buddy Jeff, he wrote this bonus episode song. That is how we signal to you that this is a bonus episode, not one of the official episodes it's something we do on weekends from time to time when we want to step back and just take a breather and think together about the big picture of the proposition of what we're working on or maybe a few highlights or cool details that we didn't have time to chase down all the way in our conversation. So that's what you're getting right there. And also, I think it's worth clarifying because my data indicates that there are a lot of you here right now who are really very new in the last few weeks to this conversation and this podcast, which again is awesome. You are here, but you might not know this. So let me just lay it out a little bit. What you are listening to right now is effectively season two, if you will, of this podcast. It's the one where we're going straight through the whole Bible, one book per day until we're done. I'm just doing my best to break down and make sense with normal human language, each book of the Bible in order. But season one was different. It was a deep dive into one book, the book of Matthew. And I worked on that for three years and learned so much. And we just wrapped that up as I'm recording this a couple of months ago after 800 episodes. And I know this sounds overwhelming. But when you're done with this, you might really like it. I really like doing it. And maybe you want to go check that out and see if it's a fit for you. Either way, I'm glad you're here now in what I suppose is season two. And at this little breather point for me, because I just finished Malachi. Now, I think you just finished Nahum. That's the episode that we published yesterday. But I'm five books ahead of you in terms of my recording and homework and everything, which means I'm about to turn the page to Matthew when I go into work on Monday. And I'm pausing at this moment to reflect on this whole Old Testament experience that I've just gone through that you are just about done going through with me. And I have some observations. Here's the first observation. I did not know nearly as much about the Bible as I thought I knew. I don't want to be an arrogant cuss. I don't want to be someone who imagines he knows a bunch of stuff because I constantly learn that I don't know things. But I've read it a lot. I went to school for this. I've had really smart hyper competent rock star professors pour into me and teach me stuff. And yet I'm reading through this material and I'm seeing stuff I've never seen before stuff that I just straight up forgot or maybe I zoned out every time I read it. I don't know what's wrong with me. But there's stuff I've straight up missed in the Old Testament that I've caught this time and that has been amazing. I can't believe how much as I got into the minor profits. I mean, that's usually where I personally stall out. I kind of get a charge at a Leviticus. And I don't hate that second run through of the history and first and second chronicles. I bawg a little bit in both of those. But the minor profits are usually what kills me. And I kind of got to grind through them. But not this time. And it's because of you. You're here. And so I can't just fake it completely. I actually have to I actually have to grapple with each of these books as many times as it takes. I got to read them as many times as it takes to kind of see the matrix and put something on the internet that's defensible. And that is hopefully a fair reflection or my best effort at representing what's actually in there and why it's actually in the Bible and how it all hangs together. And I've just become obsessed with this prophetic literature section here toward the end of the Old Testament. So many little things and nuggets and maybe it's because we just did Matthew together. And Matthew is a book that is written by one of Jesus' disciples to the Jewish people, people who were theoretically looking for a Messiah. But they had you know their cultural memory. It was all this stuff that you and I just looked at in the Old Testament and all that story up through first and second chronicles and then Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther, the stuff that we get narratively in Daniel, all of that business is what they just experienced. All of the berating, brutal prophecies calling out their horrible, awful behavior and the repentance and the restoration and the failure again and again and again. And then you get another 400 years of stuff like that in between the Testaments. And then you get to Matthew and Matthew is writing to an audience of people who I think some of them were losing hope that God would remember that he would see this thing through. And I think some others had shifted their hope to something more violent in nature than the king who was promised and talked about through the Old Testament and with increasing specificity as we get toward the end of the prophetic books here in the Old Testament. And so as I worked through Matthew with so many of you, and there's so many dips back into the Old Testament. So maybe that just helped me have my antenna out for it more because Matthew was fresh. But this was invigorating going through all of this and and just seeing stuff I hadn't seen before. So thank you. And I'm not just blown smoke. I'm really grateful to you because I wouldn't have done that without you being willing to think about all of this with me. So I'm grateful. Seriously, it means a lot. But in addition to that, I've had to read these books more times than I expected. And that's another reason that this has been harder than I expected because I figured I'd be able to read each book once, see the matrix on that book, fill out, you know, maybe one page, it's about what I'm trying to get to in terms of my little notes that I write down. But yeah, my goal is to do all of this primarily just depending on the text itself. And I can't help but remember some of the stuff I got taught about these books and classes that I've read along the way. But I'm trying to just do the honest read, not like the denominational read or the try to leverage you toward a certain outcome or leverage you toward like some sort of political conclusion or culture war nonsense. I'm not doing any of that. I just coming at this the way I want to come at it, which is as fresh as possible. I think there's a God behind it. Let's see what's here. And so I figured I'd just read each book and then I'd be pretty much good to go. We just turn on the microphone and do it. And that has not been the case. I think only two of these books in the Old Testament were I able to read just once and feel like I got it well enough to go ahead and record that that was a horrible sentence. Man, oh well, we're not editing. I'm just going to leave the ugliness of that there. What I'm saying is every single book but two of these I had to read multiple times to feel like I had a handle on them to start to see the structure and see the rhythm of it and be able to talk about it in a big picture sense. And so this really forced me to zoom out and to appreciate the Old Testament in a way that maybe I haven't before. I feel like I really believe in God. But I feel like I believe in God more and see him and his character and how his word hangs together better as a result of doing this. So just to be clear, this whole thing is not performative. I am learning with you. This is very difficult for me and very rewarding. And yeah, this is this little line in the Bible that gets repeated so often that God's word does not return void. And that's what I'm finding. I can't pick this up and just work on it and have it do nothing to my life. It is affecting my life. Even when I'm not working on this stuff and working with you my mind and my heart feels different as a result of this. So that's been pretty cool as well. Big picture on this Old Testament thing. One of the things that I'm noticing as I get to the end of it here is the second to last book of the Old Testament is Zechariah. And after reading that book a bunch, I read that one the most of any book in the Old Testament in part just because I liked it in part because I was a little bit ahead at that point. So I had the luxury of a little more time to keep reading it. And in part because every time I read it, I would catch something new structurally and I would catch something new in terms of how it points to Jesus. I mean, Zechariah is just loaded with Jesus, Messiah, stuff. And so one, I just really liked the book. But two, I came to see the theme of that book as being closely tied to what Zechariah's name means, which is God remembers, Yahweh remembers. And so here this book is real close to the end of the Old Testament. By the time you get there, you very much in reflective look back, think about how all this hangs together, what does the story mean kind of mode? And then you run into this prophet, whose name is God remembers. And you think about that for a minute, I'm like, well, does he? And then you look big picture at this story that can really only be appreciated, big picture after having done what you and I are doing right now. And you go, huh, yeah, he kind of does, doesn't he? There are all these awful injustices and horrible, wicked things throughout the Bible, not like silly little hand slap things, where maybe we imagine God to be mean and picky-unish and too demanding, like, oh, God is judgy about things that I feel that, you know, he persecutes. No, no, no, I'm not talking about that kind of stuff. I'm talking about just the gross, grievous, gigantic evils that any sane person would look at happening that are described in the Old Testament. Any sane person would see that and be like, there needs to be justice for that. That has to be answered for that. Can't just flow downstream and be forgotten. Well, then you get to the end of the Old Testament, you read this book of Zechariah, you see what he's doing in the book, you think back on the whole Old Testament, you're like, you know what, he kind of did remember all of that stuff. Like even one of the prophets is talking about why there's going to be judgment all these years later because of that incident with Naboth's vineyard. I mean, somebody stole somebody else's land and ruined this other person's family. And there's still some outstanding prophecies oracles of judgment against that guy and his line. And well, that finally is going to get paid off because God remembers. And that was really intellectually interesting to me and viscerally encouraging to me as I look around my world. And I see things that look not very just, see institutional evils. I see evil leaders. I see evil voting blocks. I mean, it's amazing how good we are at doing things that are destructive in small numbers. But also, when we all get together, we also do things that are destructive. The stain of sin is in the fabric. It's on us. And there's a lot of injustice in the world that I've participated in that and I've enabled that. And there's even stuff that I've done there, even people right now who when they think of their hall of fame of people who have hurt them and they feel they've been unjustly treated, I'm probably in it. I regret that. I want to patch all that up, but I probably am. So there's just stuff that's hanging out there. And sometimes it feels like it's just all going over the waterfall. Just that that went out with the Friday news cycle. Now we're going to get six more days of injustice. And the worst parts of it will get tweeted out at 4 45 p.m. Eastern time at the end of the Friday news cycle. And those will go over the waterfall and nothing will ever happen. Nothing will ever be done for justice for the people who are wrong for the evil that occurred. And then you get to the old testament, you think about Zachariah and you're like, no, now God remembers, and there will be justice for the oppressed. Stuff will get sorted out somehow. And his justice will be right and his justice will be perfect. But also, that whole God remembers theme of Zachariah and of, I think the whole Old Testament also includes the mercy part. He keeps remembering to be merciful, even to people, even to this big family of Abraham, who were more down than up, but up and down all over the place. He hasn't bailed. He didn't quit. The redemptive plan somehow keeps finding a way. And so God remembers is scary if you go around perpetrating evil all the time. And if you become addicted to that evil and do it in the shadows and think there'll be no reckoning for that ever, like the evil empires of Assyria and other characters like that we read about in the Old Testament. But that whole God remembers thing is encouragement to the hurting, the oppressed, the marginalized heck, the person who's doing well, but is still legitimately wounded, dinged up by institutional evil or stuff that other people did. We're all victimizers. We're all victimized. And God remembers. So what is that going to look like when we get to the New Testament? If God remembers his mercy, but he also remembers his justice, which one do I get is someone who reads through the Old Testament and likes it. I mean, I want the mercy part where he remembers all the ways that I've been hurt and does justice for me on my behalf, where he's merciful to me in spite of myself. But I find great solace in the idea that God remembers on the justice side for all the people who've done bad things to me or to people to whom I feel empathy or compassion. So again, I asked the question coming out of the Old Testament, which one do we get? And that's pretty quickly answered in the New Testament. In the New Testament, what we're going to see is the completion of all of this stuff about God's character and his relationship with people and the sacrificial system and his justice and his ongoing patience and mercy. The justice thing is going to be worked out at the expense of his son. Jesus is going to show up as the Messiah. And we've seen allusions to how he's going to suffer. He's going to suffer at the hands of even his own Zechariah gets into that as well. But the specifics of it don't totally come into focus until we get into Matthew, until we get into the rest of the New Testament. And then we realize God's righteous wrath, his not forgetfulness toward the evil that needs to be addressed, it will be satisfied. There will be justice for those things. A price will be paid. It's just that in this strange twist of intervention, this glorious, beautiful twist, as God carries out that judgment as he executes that in Christ, he is also executing his mercy that he also remembers. So what we're going to find is we get into the New Testament is that this tension is resolved in Jesus. It's resolved in the cross and the resurrection. And I feel more prepared to go and encounter that and really soak it in and appreciate that right now than maybe at any other time in my life coming out of the Old Testament and standing at the precipice of the wide open country in front of me that is the New Testament as I get ready to hike down into it and explore it myself. And as you come with me, which I'm really excited about. So I've had a blast. This has been very humbling, very fun. I'm already scheming up ways that I can do this again and again. What's another angle that I can take? What's another way that I can build this into the rhythm of my life every year or every few years? And I don't know exactly what that's going to look like. But what I know is I want to chase this feeling. And I want to be around the Bible at the depth and with the intensity that I've been around it for the last few months. I think I'm going to come out of this a different person. And I'm hoping you're having a meaningful experience with that as well. So this week, you'll catch up with me. And then the week after that, hey, we're off and running into Matthew, we'll go and meet Jesus and a whole new set of historical circumstances as well. I think that'll be a lot of fun. I sent out a whole bunch of cool little notebooks to everyone who supports the program in any way. We did a deep dive in anybody who we could find who had sent something in recent months on any platform. We really did our best to make sure everybody who was supporting in any way when we sent those out would get a little booklet for this through the Bible series season two, if you will, and then also a booklet ahead of season three, which is going to be a trip through the book of Esther and a historical deep dive into the cultural context there, which is the Persian Empire. It's going to be so much fun. We're going to do that right after we're done with this part. So we sent all of those out. It was a massive project. It was really fun stuff and envelopes. And we got all the domestic stuff out first. We got some help to send it out to everybody who is from outside the United States. And I got a bunch of them back. Some of the addresses didn't work. And so if you didn't get one, there's a decent chance you're on that list. The post office or international shipping or something didn't like the address we had for you. And so it's possible that that just came back to us. I am sorry about that. I just got a big stack of those, maybe another six or seven of them here the other day. So hey, I meant well, if you didn't get one and you're still hoping to get one, you can shoot me an email and we're going to do our best. I don't mind paying to ship it to you again. I don't mind trying it again. I'd really like for you to have that. And I'm really grateful for the help from everybody who supports the program. Obviously, you're the reason this exists. It just it wouldn't make sense. I'd have to find another way to make things go for my family if you weren't doing that. So the least I can do is send you these books. If you didn't get one, I'd love to hear from you. And I would love to take another run at getting that your direction. Also, the way the Patreon thing works, which is where most of the support for this program comes for. It's patreon.com slash what is it? The TMVH podcast. Yeah, I think that's it. If you go there, even if you've never had a Patreon account before, it's a real simple thing. You sign up for it. And then every time I make something, I go in and I tick a little box. It's like, all right, there we go. We charge the patrons. That's the way it's set up. So we have a set up that we do that once a week, roughly on Monday for a week of podcast. And so if you sign up for like two bucks a week, you know, over the course of a normal month, that would be four weeks and it would be be eight bucks, which is awesome and just amazing and ridiculously generous. And I continue to be blown away that anybody does that at all. Thank you again. But from time to time, I totally forget to tick that little box. And I did that this week. So I'm going to go and, or I guess it was two weeks ago, the first week in February, I forgot to tick that little box. So I'm going to go and do that and publish this little bonus episode along with that. So if you see, if you see that charge come through, that's what it's about. It's because I forgot the first week of the month because I don't know, probably probably because I'm looking at the Bible a lot right now and not paying attention to some of the other things that I normally need to pay attention to. So yeah, thanks everybody who supports the program. And thanks to everybody who doesn't, you don't need to do that at all. It's a free conversation that we have together. And I like it that way. And I'm glad you're here, whether you're the kind of person who supports things on the internet you can have for free or not. I think, like I was saying at the beginning, it's really cool for me personally to get to have this kind of conversation with a diverse room like this with people who aren't just like me talking about the most important stuff that I can imagine and liking each other in the process. It's just awesome. Cool. All right. I'm going to go get cracking on Matthew and I'll let you finish up the rest of the Old Testament this week. And we'll keep pressing ahead. I appreciate you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
