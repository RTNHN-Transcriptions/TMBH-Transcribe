 I remember rascaling around a little bit here and there when I was a kid and by rascaling, I don't mean like anything super scandalous. It's just sort of a normal childhood for the 80s and 90s and you had a real long leash and you didn't have any automatic generic boredom quencher device in your pocket that just made it all go away whenever you needed it to. Well, I guess there were Game Boys. But it just wasn't the same as what a phone does. And so the expectation was, you're supposed to be bored and the boredom is supposed to make you want to go do things and explore the world and it's supposed to make you curious. Here's a bunch of freedom to go do it. Go do it. Just figure it out. And so we would go and do that and usually it's pretty harmless, but every now and then you'd get into a little bit of a scrap, you know, a little bit of trouble. Maybe end up somewhere that you weren't supposed to be rather innocently with your friends. But I was always the super soft-hearted kid who remembered all of the stories that mom and dad told me about doing the right thing. And I remember the goofus and gallant cartoons from highlights. And so if anybody ever did catch us somewhere we weren't supposed to be, I would always be the one who was like, guys, we can't run. We have to talk to him. And then everybody would run. And I'd just be there. Dang, I should have ran. And then I ended up having the conversation and then I'm getting in trouble. What I like the most about this analogy is that in it, all of my deadbeat friends who ran and deserted me are like the disciples on their worst day. And I'm like Jesus of Nazareth, the Savior of the entire world, God in the flesh. I don't see any problem at all with this. Likewise, I think this is actually one of the stronger ones we've ever done. Likewise, though, in Matthew 26 and verse 31, Jesus is no longer saying like, one of you is going to bail out on me as soon as the pressure gets turned up. He goes from one of you will betray me like saying at the last supper, it's going to be one of your fault. One of y'all are just going to inflict this thing on me. And of course, we've discussed at length that he clarified that it was Judas and then it did turn out to be Judas. But now with maybe everybody else feeling a little better about it, like, well, he didn't say that it was me. I'm good. I'm loyal. I'm well behaved. Now he turns to them as they finish singing the hymn that they sang. Again, I think that was probably something from Psalm 118. And then they go to the Mount of Olives, which isn't really a very long walk at all from where they probably were. They go down, they go back up in elevation. They've got a really beautiful, idyllic view of the city. I think that just would have played into the dramatic mood of the entire thing. And maybe it's about the time that they're getting over there to where they're going to set up shop on the Mount of Olives. Maybe it's on the way. Jesus says this. Then Jesus told them. This very night, you will all fall away on account of me for it is written, I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. Now the second half of that is a reference to Zechariah. I did not remember where, just a second. I am looking. Zechariah 13, I put a receipt in there. So I remember where it was. It's a reference back here to where the prophet in the Old Testament says, awake, oh, sword against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me, declares the Lord Almighty, strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered and I will turn my hand against the little ones. It's pretty freaky and it's pretty confusing language in its original context that really comes into focus as Jesus invokes it here in Matthew 26. And now you look back on that stuff in Zechariah and you're like, oh, okay, well, we're talking about this moment when Jesus in her circle would abandon him. And when this shepherd king, this servant who is predicted back in the Old Testament here when he's in his hour of need, this most difficult moment, this is what's going to go down. It's just going to add to the humiliation and the pain and the injustice of the entire crucifixion affair that we got a lot more Zechariah to talk about. So we'll be getting back that direction a little bit. But how about that first phrase? Is that ring a bell? You got to go back ways. But is that ring a bell? It's very night. You will all fall away on account of me. I had to think for a minute, but I was able to pull it mostly because of you and how it's time we've spent here. And because as I've argued it a couple of different moments, I really think that Matthew 11 is an underrated chapter in terms of its pivotal importance in Jesus' relationship to the crowds in terms of clarifying how Jesus was following up on the stuff that John the Baptist did or rather that John the Baptist was predicting and pointing to all of the grand stuff that Jesus would do. There's just a lot in Matthew 11 that is right at the back of your brain. And that's where that phrase pops up. So you'll recall in Matthew 11, Jesus is just getting done with the conversation with the disciples about how things are going to go when they go out into the great wide world on their big open world quest. It's dangerous to go alone here, take this little wood sword and you'll green elf outfit and go out there into the great wide world. And this is what it's going to be like in the immediate term, in the medium term and for all the people who are going to come after you term, and then they go off and do that around in Galilee. And then I guess presumably they come back because in verse two, it says when John, John the Baptist heard in prison what Christ was doing. He sent his disciples to ask him, are you the one who was the commerce? Should we expect someone else? And Jesus replied, go back and report to John. What you hear and see, ah, hi, you remember this, right? This is that Isaiah 35 stuff where Jesus answers like, I don't know. What is the Bible say about what it's going to be like when the Messiah comes? Well, it says this, the blind are going to receive sight, the lame are going to walk. Those who have leprosy are going to be cured, the deaf are going to hear the dead are going to be raised. The good news is going to be preached to the poor. It's just, it's Isaiah. It's straight out of the book. And Jesus is like a two plus two. This one's very, very straightforward. But then he says, as he's wrapping this up, blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me. And remember when we talked about that a long, long time ago, I think we got a little bit hung up on it because the language is a bit confusing. Now if you go and you dig into the original language a little bit more, this one is, is one of those that gets rendered in a lot of different ways and a lot of different translations. But there's definitely some kind of illusion to the idea of stumbling here that the NIV is, is communicating as fall away. But it looks to me like in the original language, what Jesus is saying here would have connected with that whole Psalm 118 thing again that we were looking at yesterday and that they just got done singing. I am stalling to turn to it. I have succeeded in a way of not. Psalm 119 is so long. Stop it. Psalm 119. You're making me look like an idiot in front of my internet friends. There we go. Psalm 118 verse 22. The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone. And so often that language about the cornerstone or the capstone also relates to the idea of the stone that causes the stumbling of the people who are opposed to what God is doing through that centerpiece, that linchpin, that keystone, that cornerstone of his redemptive plan and the cornerstone is of course, Jesus, he's made that clear, Matthew's making that clear. And so anytime this stumble language comes up and this is maybe a little bit difficult to catch in the English rendering, but the closer you look, the more you realize it's there. Anytime this stumbling language comes up regarding people not knowing what to do with Jesus and responding to him incorrectly or improperly, it's connected to this idea of him being this stone, this cornerstone. Remember at the end of Matthew 21 when Jesus could hit with that series of questions and he fires back with clever answers and parables that demonstrate the fraudulent of the religious leadership and he says in Matthew 21 43, therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed. It's still clear that this cornerstone motif, this stumbling stone that is also the central supporting stone that holds the whole thing together. This motif runs throughout all of Matthew and it runs throughout the Old Testament as well. There's a reason Matthew is drawing on it and not just Matthew, but Matthew quoting Jesus drawing on it as well. The idea of this stone and the position it holds is that it really could go one of two ways. If one misevaluates this stone as being the centerpiece, the one that holds it all together, there would be great consequences for the building or for the person who strikes themselves against it. Again, maybe I'm stretching that language a tiny bit, but for the person who recognizes what it is, they see the beauty of the whole structure. They see how it all fits together and they know where to point to say that right there. That is the linchpin. That is the thing that makes it all work. But what Jesus is lamenting and predicting in Matthew 26 is that the people who should really should see that this chief cornerstone is indeed the centerpiece. The ones who should see it for what it is and get it the most, they are not going to, at least in the immediate short term that Jesus is talking about, they like so many others are going to stumble over it. And at least for a moment, that means that the disciples are going to be like the individual represented by the rocky soil in Matthew chapter 13 in the parable of the four soils where Jesus again uses that language that depending on your translation, the English might not show it, but it's there, that language of stumbling. Jesus says in verse 20, the one who received that seed that fell in the rocky places, the man who hears the word and it once receives it with joy, but since he has no root, he lasts only for a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the world, he quickly falls away. So you've got Jesus warning about falling away on account of him. You've got Jesus warning about falling away on the account of the world. It looks like those are slightly different forces that are at work, but either way, this fall away or more literally this stumble would seem to be connected to this cornerstone language that he just got done singing with them about one verse earlier in Matthew 26.30. It's sure enough in the same way that all my friends hung me out to dry when we were in that guy's field and apparently there was a sign and we weren't supposed to be in that field and they all left me there to just talk to him and then I got in trouble and none of them did. It's hard for me to even finish it because I do get to be Jesus in this analogy and that's kind of crap, but I might as well just wrap it up now. So Jesus gets left by all his friends and if you've ever been ditched by all your friends or done any of the ditching, I guess you get a little bit about how that works. The difference here is that it's not to some guy. It's Jesus of Nazareth, the centerpiece, the linchpin of the entire redemptive plan and further the behavior of the disciples was predicted and even their bad disloyal behavior is held out by Matthew as being a providential fulfillment of what was predicted about how this was also supposed to go down from centuries earlier and therefore their bad behavior is just one more thing that points to the reality that Jesus is indeed the Christ is indeed this cornerstone, this linchpin, this centerpiece of the whole redemptive plan. We got a new good ideas for churches episode up. I think it's really good. This one is a little less practical and a little more big picture like this is what's going on in the world. How do our brains work now? How do we interact with each other? The changes are happening in our relationship with authority. And so whether you are somebody who does something at a church or not, I think you might really enjoy that conversation that Aaron hosted over on the new good ideas for churches podcast. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
