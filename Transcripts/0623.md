 I'm going to start with Squishy Heart of Dad stuff here. I got three kids, the two older ones, or my little girls and the youngest ones, my little boy. And I'm crazy about them. There's nothing I love more than being a dad to them. Husband to my wife, the family thing for me is beautiful and rich. We are right in the middle of the wonder years, the awesome years of all of this. I mean, someday we will yearn and long for running around town and getting kids to all the things we're getting them to and sitting down and eating together at the end of the day and laughing at YouTube videos together and just all the things that we do. It's so good right now. But when those little girls came into the world, they changed me. And I sometimes say like, oh, they awaken to something in my heart, but I'm not even sure they awaken to something in my heart. I think that something new was born in my heart when they were born. And it was a combination of softness and compassion and tenderness and feeling that the well-being of another human might be more important than the well-being of me. And this sense of highest regard for another person who at this point is mostly just potential. Like they're not even there yet, but I see so much of what they could be like. I never felt any of that stuff before. And I kid you not. My oldest, she came into the world and I started to feel all of those things within like 60 seconds. I had this biological God-given impulse to be like, I need to show you everything you've never seen a mirror before. This is a mirror. And I'm so old. This is water. This is what happens when it pools. This is what happens when it flows. I wanted to be the first one to introduce you. Pretty cool. What am I talking about? You were in water this whole time. I'm so embarrassed. I'm sorry. I'm nervous. I've never met a kid before that is my kid. This is kind of a big deal for me. And there's just all this swirling mass of emotions has never gone away or subsided. It's just sort of matured over time and become something I'm more dialed to over time. There's stuff that I cry in in movies now that never affected me beforehand. I'm going on and on. This is too much. So let me just get to this. There's also this thing that happens with me being a dad and loving them that much where if I send those brave little girls out into a challenging social situation where they don't know anybody and I see some little kid come up to them or group of little kids come up to them and include them and open their circle to them and take them under their wing and make sure that they know it's okay and that they're included. I love those kids forever. Like I don't care what they turn out to be. I'll still always think they're awesome because of what they did for my kids and how they treated them. What you did to those little kids you might as well have done for me because I received it that deeply. Thank you youngster. I see how you treated my daughters well done. Also there is an opposite and probably even more intense reaction to me sending my girls out into a difficult social situation and seeing them weighed out into it and then seeing someone decide to be willfully cruel to exclude them for their own benefit to hurt them to harm them to gossip about them to damage them. And that makes me feel outraged. I control it because they're kids and I do my best to forgive it because they're kids but left unchecked my heart impulse is to say even to that kid I bet 20 years from now I know who you are. I saw what you did to my daughters when you guys were all five. I'll never forget. Okay, I will forget like that's not right. That's not the attitude that should be there. But if you understand that impulse as a parent or for that matter as somebody who loves anyone then I think that helps set us up to get the rest of what we're going to encounter in Matthew chapter 25. With this stuff about the sheep and the goats we've spent the last couple of days looking at it and through those couple of conversations I've been trying to reframe this whole passage a little bit because the part of the passage that is going to pop for a modern audience right now is the part where God is judge and where he makes a value judgment where he looks at a thing and is like I know all the things I'm fit to make the judgment and I do make the judgment and you over here you're going to the right and you over here you're going to the left. It's like an ultimate reckoning and that is very, very, very, very troubling for how we think right now. No one, not even God should be allowed to do that. Well the reality is I'm with you on the no one part right up until not even God like ultimately justice is a thing we all yearn for. We talked about that yesterday and ultimately reason and the rightness of God demands that at some point there's a reckoning and we've talked a lot about a whole bunch of the things that go into that and we're going to talk about that a whole lot more and if you're troubled by this stay tuned because the whole cross thing that happens at the end of Matthew addresses the tension you feel with that right now. But I think for most people throughout history that thing that troubles us was not what popped from this passage. I think what's popped for most people and what is supposed to pop for us is the father, the judge, the king's attitude toward how his beloved little children get treated. He's sending them out like sheep among wolves. Remember that Matthew 10, 16? We can do something really dangerous, a hostile environment, a troubling situation. And what we're discovering in this last passage here of Matthew 24 and 25 is that the king's got a real soft spot for his sons, daughters, heirs, agents, children. And when they are mistreated, excluded, abused, that's a problem for the father. I think we want a father like that, don't we? Whose heart is soft for us and who cares about these things and who takes it as a personal offense if his own children are mistreated or abused by someone else? That's what's being described here. Remember, the flow of thought is not first and foremost. How do we get to the judgment? What's the reckoning? The flow of thought in Matthew 24 and 25 has been disciples asked, you're coming back. How do we know what that looks like? What's the timeline? When is that all going to go down? And Jesus really relatively quickly answers that. And then he pivots and implicitly is saying, timeline is the wrong question, bros. The correct question is, what should you be doing in light of all of this? What we're getting is another thing that the kingdom citizen should be doing in anticipation of the return of the master. And that is doing right by the children of the master, doing right by others, doing right by people who are in a difficult position, living out kingdom values toward others in such a way that it glorifies God and serves people like all of us who have needs. So with that in mind, let's just listen to how this whole passage plays out. Matthew 25 32, we've worked on this part already when the son of man comes, I'm sorry, it's verse 31, when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him and he'll separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He'll put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. That was pretty quick. We buzz through that real, real fast there. It's like, okay, there's judgment. The original audience apparently was like, okay, yeah, we knew that. We know that's what happens like with God. Of course, there's going to be a reckoning. He's God. They're not threatened by this. They expect it. If this were written to a modern audience, maybe he would linger on that a little bit longer. He said, the surprise here, the pivot is into the evaluative feedback that the king is giving to the people who he is sending off to his right and to his left. And this is the instructive part. It says, then the king will say to those on his right, come, you who are blessed by my father, take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. That sounds a lot like the very last passage with the parable of the talents where the two come back and they get it right. He says, well done, good and faithful servant. You've been faithful with a few things. I'll put you in charge of many common share in your master's happiness. So now we get another statement of blessing, like the thing you want to hear from the king. If you are a servant of said king, take your inheritance and the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. And then he goes on to say, why? For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. It was a stranger and you invited me in and he did clothes and you clothed me. I was sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you came to visit me. Then the righteous will answer him, Lord, when do we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink? When do we see you as stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothes you? When do we see you as sick or in prison and go visit you? And the king will reply. I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me. Then he will say to those on his left, depart from me, you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink. I was a stranger and you didn't invite me in. I needed clothes and you didn't clothe me. I was sick and in prison and you didn't look after me. They also will answer, Lord, when do we see you hungry or thirsty or are you a stranger or needing clothes or a sick or in prison and didn't help you? He will reply. I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you didn't do for me. Then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life. You can see that there is a lot of symmetry in this passage the way it rounds out. This is a justice passage. There are two levels of justice. There's the justice that happens on the horizontal level between peers, the kids and how they receive the little girls who walk into the social situation. There's that. Justice means, hey, these are outsiders who are in need. Let us do the thing that is just and right and good and include them and welcome them in. There's that but then there's also the ultimate justice of the king coming in and evaluating the situation and saying either you did that or you did not do that. If justice is a thing, necessarily judgment from the one who is in the position to do the judging must also be a thing. They're necessarily connected. And I say again, while on the surface that is culturally troubling for us in the right now in the grand scheme of things, if we step away from our debates and who said what and who we're mad at as humans, we have a built in sense of justice. We know that the people who are being rightly condemned by the master here and being told like you wanted this stuff from me, you wanted this grace, you wanted to be received into my kingdom, but you didn't receive anybody into your little kingdom. The cost of me bringing in into my kingdom is so much greater than the cost to you to bring somebody into your little kingdom. And you didn't even do that. You just thought about yourself. I mean, it sounds a lot like the parable from a little while back about the guy who got forgiven a huge debt, but wouldn't forgive somebody who owed him just a little bit. And that's reminiscent of the Lord's prayer itself or the only positive thing that we pray in the Lord's prayer that we'll actually do is forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors. This concept of giving away the grace, the forgiveness, the values of the kingdom to other people who need it as we seek to receive that grace, that forgiveness, that provision, those values of the kingdom from God that this is the right orientation. That theme comes up in the very first of Jesus speeches and the sermon on the Mount and the very end of the Olivet Discourse right here repeats that same theme. There is an expectation that the things you are given by God or anticipate from God that are good, you need to give those things away to other people. And in this situation, some folks made that connection. And so they gave it away and they're even surprised and baffled to have it pointed out because it was second nature, just kingdom values. This is how they live and what they do. And the other side is just sitting there waiting for their reward and they didn't get it. Now, there's a whole lot of implications here about bigger questions about like how does salvation work and how do we round out this passage? Where does it fit? And we're just going to take some more time to figure that out in our coming conversations. But today, I just wanted to focus on the aspect of this passage that is reminiscent of how a parent loves their kid and the protectiveness that a parent rightly feels toward that kid and the affection that a parent rightly feels toward someone who does right by their kid and the frustration that a parent rightly feels when someone wrongs or abuses their kid. A good parent feels those things. And apparently the heavenly father, the king, whose character is on display here is good parenting. I want to believe and I'm glad to find in the Bible that the God character and all of this, the father character and all of this cares about his kids and cares about what happens to them and how they are treated. That he cares about the weak, the vulnerable, the outsider and that he further expects his own kids to do right by them in the same way. I would expect my own kids to always be the one who opened the circle and welcome and treat other people the right way. And in the same way that I would be very, very upset with my kids for not doing that. So the father has those high expectations for those who identify with him and are a part of his kingdom as well. I promise we're going to talk about this patron idea I have today, but we're at a time. We'll kick it down the road again. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
