 Hi there, I'm Jeff and this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Today's episode features Matt in the third part of a conversation with his friend, Aaron Utect. Parts 1 and 2 can be found in episodes 205 and 206. Without any further ado, let's get to that intro music. Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. I'm hanging out with my buddy, Aaron Utect. We had a really good question from somebody who goes by the Reddit handle, Rome, L-P-I-S 1212, about the idea of the initiating prayer, the initiating moment at which somebody's like, you know what? I think there's something to the Jesus thing and I think I want to sign up and follow Jesus. And so how do I do that? Well, for a long time, there's been this idea that you pray this prayer that is drawn from different parts of the New Testament. It's all Bible-y, but it is a relatively recent innovation. Prior to that, one might enter the church by going to the high church and having them baptize you. And then that initiates your relationship with the church and having a relationship with the church is how you have a relationship with God or enter into following God. But in the age of Protestantism, there's a little more skepticism about that mechanism of having that all funneled through the church. And so inevitably, there comes a moment where this idea of an initiating prayer surfaces. This becomes very popular starting in the early 1800s, especially in America and in evangelicalism. And as maybe come under appropriate scrutiny a little bit more here in recent years, and that is what I think the question that Rome for short is asking us here, this individual rightly points out that they can't find any evidence of a sinner's prayer in the Bible, but that rather following Jesus seems to be the rather nebulous formula for how one starts as a Christian, how one gets in. But like I said, this is a huge question. How you sign up is a really big deal. So here's what I want to bounce off of you, Aaron, as we were going through the sermon on the Mount with the conversation we have here on the podcast, we got to the part about the Lord's Prayer, one of the most famous parts of the whole Bible. And the argument that I made, and I want to bounce off of you, is that I think there is an initiating prayer in the Bible. I think there is a sinner's prayer in the Bible. I don't think that by reciting those words in order, there's some magical spiritual transaction that occurs and then just now you did the thing you have to do to be a Christian. Rather I think the orientation of the Lord's Prayer, your God, I'm not, your kingdom, not mine, you provide, I don't, you're in charge of justice and mercy. You protect me from my enemies. Total dependence on God and embracing of the values of the kingdom, that to me is the posture of following. If somebody's looking for something a little bit more precise than just a nebulous follow. Am I crazy? Is it too much of a stretch to say that the Lord's Prayer in a way is the sinner's prayer? Those are two different questions. Are you crazy? Is that legitimate? Okay, that's right. Don't even answer the first one. The answer to both would be yes. But I know, actually I think it is. I think that's a good way to think about it. The Bible seems to be a little bit more open-ended about how it begins rather than what's commonly called the sinner's prayer. About how becoming a Christian begins? Becoming a Christian, yeah. It's a little more open-ended. The sinner's prayer in a lot of circles is treated somewhat superstitiously. As long as I recite these words, well, I pray the prayer. My kid prayed this prayer back when they were a kid. So I know they're Christian, even though they're not bad. So the words of it are not bad, but it can become. I think this is a human tendency. We want to know what's the minimum, what's the formula? Give me the superstitious right. I'll throw the oil on the statue. I'll burn the incense. I'll slaughter the chicken. What it will do the right. Just tell me what the right of passages. We're uncomfortable with this totally being open-ended. I like what you're saying in that Lord's Prayer. I think that makes a lot of sense because it's a heart orientation. It means your kingdom come not mine. That's completely... It feels like an empty... Up-and-day. ...at the beginning of the thing. Like you don't even think about it. That upends everything. It's a total reversal. It disrupts everything about our lives. We are constantly, subconsciously, most of the time, posturing to build our influence. I mean, we're all encouraged on social media now. Build your following. Be an influencer. We all are posturing to build our own little kingdom. And when we come to follow, we just get completely disabused of all of that. To pray that your kingdom come not mine. Your will be done. Not mine. That's really hard. I think it's harder than the sinner's prayer. Because that isn't in the sinner's prayer. The sinner's prayer that I prayed both times I converted once when I was a little kid. I guess I converted three times. Why does anyone listen to this? What the heck do I know? When I was a little kid, we're still working on Matt to convert him fully. That's fair. When I was a little kid, I became a Christian laying in bed after breaking a rule and my dad caught me and rather than punishing me, explained the whole grace of Jesus thing. And it made sense. And I was like, I want to follow Jesus, dad. And he was like, all right, well, this is what you pray. And I have no problem with him doing that. I have no problem with the way he laid that out. I think that's probably when I became a Christian. And then because of the constraints of my household, I behaved well enough that I suppose it looked at least externally. Like I was a kid who was following Jesus. And then I got to a point where I was a little bit older and a Charles Finney style revival guy came to town and he said a bunch of good words and applied some pressure. And I was like, I'm not sure I got this right. I need to go up to the anxious seat and convert to a Baptist church. And so I did. And I meant it. And I prayed the center's prayer and he gave me a penny and I taped it in my Bible. I was like, this penny is a free gift. And the grace of God is like that's a beautiful illustration. And I still have that penny taped in that Bible. And so I don't know. That counts. That's great. But then when my faith fell apart and absolutely broke after seminary, the comeback prayer didn't sound like that at all. At that point I was in a place where God knows exactly what words I'm thinking. He knows, I'm hurting and this has kind of been a difficult season. And that prayer was very alone, very imprivate. I employed language. I don't employ in front of people very often because I was like, well, what does it matter? He knows. He knows exactly what's going on here. And in looking back, I realized that that center's prayer, when my faith came back together after breaking, it really was the Lord's prayer. Like if this thing is real, you are in charge. If we're really going to do this thing, then I have to assume that right posture that I'm seeing throughout the Bible, I have to forfeit my ability to say, my kingdom come and my will and my stuff and my things. Just because I prayed that doesn't mean that I'm exactly doing it. I don't know. It's what you aspire to. It's what you're acknowledging verbally is the truth and the reality of the situation. He's other. He's better. He's different. And I'm the opposite version of all of those things. I'm normal and pedestrian. I'm not infinite. I am flawed. I am inconsistent. So I like the version of this situation where you're king better than the one where I am, or at least verbally, that's the commitment that I'm making. And that theoretically is not just the initiating point then, but it's also the sustaining point, the trajectory of being a Christian. Yeah. Everybody has a different starting point. I don't use the sinner's prayer when I talk with people, mostly because I think it's potentially misleading. I want to jump in right there and ask you a question right on the spot here, buddy. Why does it matter if it's misleading? Who cares? Like, isn't the point to always be closing? ABC, copy is for closers, get people to sign up for Christianity. What does it matter how you get somebody to sign up? Don't we just need to get them in the door? What's the difference between getting somebody to become a Christian because we put them in the anxious seat and got them to pray the words and say the thing in front of their friends versus somebody signing up for Jesus' invitation to follow and the Lord's prayer version of it? Well, I will probably get roasted for this on the interwebs, but I don't think the point is always to be closing because what you win people with is what you win them to. And the Bible is inviting us, as we invite others to follow Christ, inviting them to a lifestyle of sacrifice where the king is on the throne and we're worshiping a king who's not us. Your kingdom come. Not your will be done, not mine. But that does not come if we trick people into it. Not to mention that if eternity really is on the line, I don't want to mislead somebody. If I'm trying to tell somebody how to get to heaven and I want to invite them into this, I want to be as transparent as possible. Disclose. Disclose. Kind of like Jesus. Kind of like Jesus. Like, yeah, you want to find me cool. I'm homeless just so you know. They smell weird. Yeah, exactly. What you win people with is what you win them to. And what we in the biblical definition, what we win them to is as important, if not more important than just plain winning them. I think you're onto something. I think the reason that my faith broke is because I signed up for a diminished version of the thing. There's a very different kind of Christianity that happens and that goes into practice when what you're pitching is kind of a partnership where you and God work together to resolve your problems in your sin and there's like this fulfillment and happiness that you feel. It's kind of a 1980s, me generation consumerism sort of version of the thing as opposed to crucified with Christ died itself and I now exist as an agent, a son, a daughter, an heir of this king and this kingdom. And this is just who I am now. This is what I do now. Is a gigantic deal. And I think that's why Jesus is hitting all the stuff about count the cost. If you're just like, oh yeah, sure, it sounds good. Whatever. I'll do this. I signed up for a lot of things. I try to be a person who says yes to things. It feels like Jesus is like, ah, then you're not getting it. You're not tracking the gravity of what we're doing here. And that's why I think back to the Lord's prayer. That is disclosure. That is Jesus saying to his original audience and his now audience, hey, this is a big deal. It's not really breakable. This becomes who you are, not just what you do. It's transformative to the deepest level. That's why I haven't really asked people to sign up on this podcast. I think one, because it's a podcast and two, we haven't heard Jesus out yet. We're in the middle of Matthew. Yeah. Maybe there was enough there for some of the original audience to be like, I've seen enough. I'm in. It looks like that happened. But it's this big deal as he's acting like it is. And as the language of the Lord's prayer says it is, it's okay to take a minute and do the math on the thing and figure out if this is actually worth like, I don't know, your eternal soul. Fair enough. In fact, Jesus himself, and you're not this far yet in your podcast, but there will come a point in Matthew's gospel where he will drive the crowds away because they're there for the wrong reason. They're assuming this is about something it's not. And he does the same thing in John's gospel as well. I guess it's good of places I need to leave with my friend. Rome, PLIS1212. That is an excellent question. Thanks for asking it. Sorry, it took me so long to get to it, but you know, we got to rhythm to this thing. We get to it when we get to it. I know that there are a bunch of you listening to this who would not say that you're in or out. You're thinking about this thing the way I was a few years ago when my faith was kind of broken and I was deciding exactly what I make of any of this and kind of starting fresh. I know there are a ton of you who are in that spot and I do not want you to mistake this conversation for some kind of clever way for me to try to close the deal with reverse psychology and like get you to sign up right now. I don't want that. I appreciate what my friend here just said. I don't want that because I think it produces a weird broken gross version of Christianity and all of us know what some of the symptoms of weird broken gross twisted up Christianity can be done right. And on the terms of the kingdom, I think it's the most beautiful thing ever. It's why we take all this time and talk about it. If you get it wrong on the front end, it perverts up into something pretty weird and dysfunctional fast. And so I don't want that for you. I don't want you to go through it. I don't want you to experience that. Obviously, you know, where I landed on this thing and what I think and I respect you wherever you're at in your process. Also I respect you, Aaron, you tech this bump. I don't know if the mics will pick that up, but I'm going to do one here so you can hear it. And thanks also to you for being up for thinking about important stuff like this. All right, we're back to Matthew Manana. I'm Matt. There's a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
