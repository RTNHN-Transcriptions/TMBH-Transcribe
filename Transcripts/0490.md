 Look, I'm not recommending that you go and watch it in any way. I'm also not saying, don't go watch it. This is the internet. You know the deal with this program. I don't get to tell you what to do and you're not here because you want to be told what to do. All of that said, Dave Chappelle just put out a new special on Netflix. And I watched that the other day. And it's funny and troubling and brave and scary and man, there's just a whole lot going on there. But as I watched it, I found that I couldn't just watch it as some guy watching a Netflix special. I was watching it as someone who's aware that there are really three completely different conversations, three completely different audiences that are in view as this Netflix comedy special is going on. One is the people who are in the room in Detroit. It was really fun to sit there and watch a handful of the people in the room respond to things. You can kind of tell what your biases were as you watch and you're like, Oh, I bet that dude is not going to like this. Oh, I bet that guy over there is going to hate that joke. I bet that lady's not going to think that's very funny. And sure enough, she didn't think that was very funny repeatedly. So you got the audience here. That's just the original audience in the room. And you've got the people who Dave Chappelle clearly has in view throughout the whole conversation who he knows are going to be super mad at him, who he's been feuding with and arguing with back and forth on the internet. So you got in the room in Detroit, then you've got audience number two, who is the internet, Twitter, the reactionary audience who are going to fire back and forth with an at Chappelle. And then you got audience number three, which is, I guess, pretty much me like person at home on couch watching Netflix with wife listening to jokes and trying to understand what is happening here socially. Three very different groups are in view. Likewise, when we get to Matthew chapters 21 and 22, really, when we get to the part of the book of Matthew, where Jesus has made his way into Jerusalem, it gets pretty confusing because there really are three conversations going on here. And I feel like we've talked about them all at separate times in this little conversation we're having today. I want to talk about all three of them at once. Conversation number one that's going on here is simply narrative. Jesus comes into town and he has some conversations with people. Here's what everybody said back and forth. Here are the stories that we're told, the Old Testament verses that were quoted. Here's what the crowds were yelling. This is the rate at which time went by. Now you got the details that are pertinent to what actually happened. That's conversation number one. Conversation number two is not even subtext. It is right through the front door. And conversation number two is one that is going on between Jesus of Nazareth and the religious leadership of the Jewish people at the time. We've spent a ton of time trying to figure out what to make of all of this, but clearly the tension between Jesus and the religious stuff he's saying about the kingdom and the religious leaders is like, this has just come to a head. Then you might think that Jesus would get to their town and that he'd try to make everything better and smooth things over and make it nice, but that notion is dismissed within about two seconds when he's like, ah, good old Jerusalem. It is good to be back here. I'm going to go kick over a ton of tables in the temple right now. And then he does that like immediately. And then you might think, oh man, he'll probably apologize. That was a little bit passionate a little bit much. Nope. He just starts telling parables in which the religious leaders are the bad guys and in which they're being called out and in which their very salvation status, their status before God is being called into question and more than called into question, it's being in tone that they're not even in by Jesus. So you got conversation number one, which is just the narrative. You got conversation number two that we're looking at here, which is between Jesus and the religious leadership and the question about what happens with Israel and all of that kind of stuff. And then you got conversation number three, which is what does all of this stuff mean for people who might believe in Jesus someday, who might believe in the resurrection and the redemptive plan and the kingdom and embrace the kingdom values and everything else that goes along with it. You're trying to read these parables and understand what he's doing from an exemplary perspective. Like, well, if I'm going to follow Jesus and I'm going to embrace his values, what do I do? What do I believe? What am I supposed to take from this? And so all three of these things are happening at once. And that makes for a very complex viewing dynamic, much like it did for me watching that Chappelle thing, even more so, this is a complex multifaceted dynamic narratively. I think we're in a pretty good place. But as I said yesterday, today is about recapping all of it and trying to wrap our brains around all of these dynamics that are going on at once. Just to be clear, narratively, everything about Jesus life has been pointing toward this moment, this little chunk of time in Jerusalem. And as the tension gets ratcheted up over little things like his disciples eating pieces of grain on a Sabbath day over Jesus healing someone on a Sabbath day over Jesus healing somebody's legs and saying your sins are forgiven and people get mad and he's like, seriously, you have a problem with that? Like, you're not sure I have authority to do that? Well, you want to see authority? Try this one on for size. Hey, get up and take your mat and walk. And then the guy does Jesus authority in the mind of the original audience, a concept that is introduced right at the end of the sermon on the Mount where it says that everybody was impressed because he taught his one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law. His authority has been crowding out and threatening the authority of the religious leadership. And so narratively, the kingdom is here. Jesus is amazing. His disciples are rough around the edges, but they're figuring it out. And there's a timetable on all of this, a time crunch on all of this, because he can't keep being him. His disciples can't keep growing as disciples. His following can't keep growing. The kingdom can't keep flourishing without that becoming a threat to the religious leadership. And they have power and they're not going to lay down that power meekly. So narratively, we're rolling Jerusalem. The pregnant question is, is he going to make nicer? Is he going to act like he acted when it was a little bit easier out in the sticks? Now he's under the bright lights and he's right here. Is he going to do the thing where he's a big talker when he's talking about someone? But as soon as they're in the room, he's a little bit more scared. Well, that really hasn't been his style anywhere else. And sure enough, true to form, he comes into Jerusalem. And if anything, he ratchets up the intensity, even going so far as to make what it looks like he's been saying all along evident that the religious leadership is broken, not worthy of being followed, and that all of these things that are man-made and silly going on in Jerusalem, these are all going to be replaced. It's going to go away. It's going to be replaced with something that is far better in a fulfillment and a completion of all of that. And that this is where Israel is supposed to go next. This is what was always intended by the prophets and all of that. And that really gets us into our summary of the second thing, which we've spent the most time on. So I don't really need to recap it very much. But pretty clearly, Jesus cleanses the temple in chapter 21 and everybody's on the defenses. But the crowds love Jesus all the more for it. And they come to him and they're like, Oh, Santa, the son of David, they want to be healed and taken care of. And he does those things and he's teaching at the temple and everything. And the religious leaders try for the first time of many times to trip him up and trick him and get him to denounce what the people are saying about him, what the children are saying about him as the son of David. And he's like, no, Bible. He quotes, saw mate saying from the lips of children and infants, you have ordained praise. So he won't denounce it. What he's saying is they're right. I am the son of David. I am the promised Messiah. I am the one who is to come, which is going to make the religious leadership even more angry. Then remember, he comes back the next morning after staying out in Bethany. And he curses that fig tree, which is a metaphor for a rejection of the Jewish leadership and the religious trajectory that the Jewish people are on under their leadership. They come to him trying to catch him in a trap. And he says, well, I'll answer your question. If you answer mine, they refuse to answer his. And then he pivots goes on the offensive three parables, the one about the landowner tells his sons to go out and work in the vineyard. One says, I'm not doing it. And then he does. The other one says, Oh, yeah, I'll do it. And then he doesn't. Jesus says which one of these guys got it right. And begrudgingly, the religious leaders have to admit the one who actually did go and work. And Jesus says to them in verse one, whatever it is, 31 of chapter 21. I tell you the truth, the tax collectors of the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to show you the way of righteousness. And you didn't believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you didn't repent and believe him. And it's like, whoa, that's a lot. But then he goes into another one. And he says, listen to another parable. And he tells them about the landowner who has the tenants and the tenants mistreat his servants and eventually even kill his own son. And then Jesus asks the religious leaders, what do you think is going to happen to those guys? And they're like, well, that landowner is not going to stand for it. And Jesus doesn't overtly affirm it. But he says, if you never read the scriptures, the stone the builders rejected has become the capstone. The Lord has done this and it's marvelous in our eyes. Therefore, I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed. The chief priests, like they're getting mad because they're like, these parables are about us. You think? Yeah, they sure are and they want to arrest him, but they can't do anything because the crowds are there. Oh, no, but we're not done yet. There's another parable that we just looked at in chapter 22, where Jesus says, the kingdom of heaven is like this wedding banquet and everybody was invited. But then when it was time, they didn't show up. And then they got so mad at the king's servants who invited him to a banquet that they killed his servants. And then the king goes and burns their cities and he tells his surviving servants, hey, go out and just round up whomever. I don't care. It's good, bad, get them all. We're going to have a wedding party here. And so everybody shows up, all of these weird outsiders. But then the king comes in and he sees somebody who's not wearing the wedding garments, maybe because those were provided. Somehow it's indicative of a rejection of the king and the king's authority and the king's generosity, even if I don't know all the historical details of how that happened. And he's like, whoa, friend, how'd you get in here without wedding clothes? And the man was speechless, just like the religious leaders were when Jesus asked them a question back one chapter earlier. And then the king's like, throw them out where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth. And then he wraps up saying, for many are invited, but few are chosen. So that brings us to the third level of conversation that we're having here. We get the narrative. We got Jesus back and forth with the Jewish leaders and the implications that we spent so much time considering for what that means, theologically for Israel, the Jewish leaders and everything that comes next. But the third level is the simple one. It's the one that's like you and me. Most of you who are in this conversation, you just statistically, I can guess you're probably not Jewish because of the population distribution of planet Earth. And you're like, I don't know, I just think Jesus is interesting, kind of compelling. I don't know if I'm going to believe in him or not, but the story has set the hook for me and I'm hanging around and I'm intrigued. Others of you are like, I've been around this for a long time. I'd just like to understand Jesus better, please. Others of you are like, this is not setting the hook, but I really enjoy the conversation and I want to understand my Christian friends and family better. Cool. Like whoever you are, you fall into this third category of people who are part of the conversation who are looking at this for the story value, but also the size up, the most compelling historical character ever in Jesus value. You're also trying to figure out like, what can I glean from his conversation with the leadership religiously of the chosen people flowing out of the Old Testament? What do I glean from that in terms of where I fit and what I do? And I think we're going to get more answers to that as we move forward. But for those of you who are mostly just interested in what to do with that part, I would say this, everything we've seen up to this point in Matthew and everything we've seen in these two chapters since we've been into Jerusalem points to the same thing in terms of your response and my response. The right response to Jesus, according to the Bible, is to assume a posture of servanthood before him. You are king. I am servant. You are master. I am not. It's to get to a place where you could authentically and earnestly pray the Lord's prayer, which is a prayer of fealty, an oath of loyalty to a king saying, how would be your name? I want whatever you want. You're the one who provides. You're the one who's in charge of justice. You're the one who's in charge of protecting us. And I defer to you on all of those things. My well-being and my fate is in your hands. But in the same way that you can watch a very complicated piece of media from our very complicated moment in history and get bogged down and trying to sort out all of the different dynamics that are occurring here. So I think it's very possible to feel that same paralysis when we get to something as multifaceted as the home stretch of Matthew. But my friends, we're in it together and we should not feel paralysis. This was written in a way that it was meant to be understood. We can understand it and sort it out. You are an excellent interpreter with years of experience, even if you don't consciously think about that all the time. And this is the kind of thing that we can wrap our brains around and move on from when we're done feeling like, okay, I get that. And I think I know what to do with it. And our conversation today was in service of those ends. Hopefully it was helpful. We'll move ahead in chapter 22 next time around. I just went through and read a bunch of the ratings and reviews that you guys left here over the last couple of weeks. Dang. Thank you. That's like the nicest stuff I've read and forever. And you don't have to say nice stuff to me, but I don't hate it. It was really encouraging. And the other thing that was really encouraging is for the first time in a long time, I went and looked at new listenership and where the podcast fits and some of the different podcast charts that are out there. And wow, you all taking the time out of your schedule to go and write that little review made a gigantic difference in that regard. So thank you very, very, very much. I think that's plenty for today. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. You
