 What's up everybody? I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and I remember this one time when I was a kid and we were driving across South Dakota from East to West to go and visit my grandparents and the sky turns bright red at night. And I remember my mom looking back and she's like, hey, look at the sky, red sky at night, sailors delight, red sky at morning, sailors take warning. I got, I don't get it. And then my parents kind of walked me through. It's like an old mariners rhyme about how the weather works and predicting the weather. It just stuck with me. And you can imagine my surprise when sometime in 1990 or 91 when I first read the Gospel of Matthew, I came across that in the Bible. It's like kind of a Bible verse. It's right here in Matthew 16 starting in verse two and three while I'll start from verse one. It says, the fair season Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. We talked about that yesterday. He replied, Jesus, that is when evening comes, you say it'll be fair weather for the skies red. And in the morning, today it'll be stormy for the skies red and overcast. So you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you can't interpret the signs at the times. Wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. Jesus then left and went away. We're in the middle of this big conversation about Matthew 16 here. And there are a ton of layers to this thing. But when Jesus invokes this ancient mariners weather predicting Diddy to an audience who apparently he expected to be familiar with it, he's using a formula that we see him use in a bunch of other places in the gospels as well. And that is this if such and such, then how much more so such and such formula. Maybe one of the most famous places where we see that that you and I have talked about is in Luke 16, there's a guy he realizes he's going to get fired from his job managing all of the affairs and finances and everything in this rich guy's household. So he's like, Hey, I got to use the resources I have now to position myself for when I get fired. So he goes around to big clients and he cuts down their debt to the manager, which is within his rights under his purview. He's the manager. And then the manager is getting ready to fire him and he finds out what's going on. And then rather than being just outraged, the master has to acknowledge, you're good, you as pretty clever. I see what you did there. And then Jesus invokes this formula again, which is, Hey, if this clown manager who has very little going on in terms of morality or principles or ethics knows what to do when you only have access to resources for a very brief time, how much more so should you all be able to figure out that you should think about your resources in the here and now very differently because the not here and now the eternal is coming right down the pike. So that's what we're getting here. The situation is one where the Pharisees and Sadducees have been waiting for Jesus to come back from Gentile territory. Jesus is back. A lot of time has passed. The Pharisees and Sadducees normally, these are political rivals. You're left and you're right have come together and unified behind the idea of rejecting Jesus. That in itself is pretty mind boggling. We'll talk about that more in just a second. When they say we want another sign, Jesus is like, do I even need to explain to you people that I just showed you 11 billion signs as we discussed yesterday. And instead of going through all the things he's already done and further instead of being like, okay, what miracle do you want that you will definitely believe? Because I want you to please ask me into your heart. Now, he doesn't do any of that. Instead, he's like, I see who you clowns are. And I'm not playing along with this or to go back to this teaching this rabbinical formula that Jesus likes to use so often. If you all are capable of getting this thing, red sky at night, sailor's delight, red sky morning sailors take warning, then how much more so should you be able to identify what's going on when the signs are even more in your face than a bright red glowing sky that covers literally the entire upper half of your field of vision. This is a harkening back to a passage that seems innocuous, but that keeps coming up as we work our way through the book of Matthew in chapter 11. This is the one where Jesus forerunner and cousin and buddy and ally and wingman and hype man, John the Baptist has been imprisoned by Herod who would later behead him at a drunken sexy party. And John's disciples come to Jesus and they're like, yeah, so we're just trying to figure out if you were like the actual Messiah, like John was kind of saying before, it looks a little different than maybe what we were expecting. So should we be looking for somebody else? And Jesus once again, very famously points them to Isaiah chapter 35. And he says, go back and report to John what you hear and see the blind receive site, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured and the deaf here and the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor. Blessed is a man who doesn't fall away on account of me. So there in chapter 11, we have John's disciples coming and asking from a place of earnestness, hey, are you the real deal? What should we make of what we're seeing? And Jesus is like, I don't know, you guys read the Bible or whatever? What do you make of it when blind people can see and lame people can walk and dead people come back to life? Looks a lot like something special to me. He doesn't even complete the thought. He's just like, well, it's not really hard to do the math guys you should be able to. And apparently they went away and were able to do the math for the most part? Well, Jesus is appealing to the same line of logic here, except he's not being quite as charitable, because I don't think he senses that the Pharisees and Sadducees are asking from the same place of goodwill that John's disciples were. And so when Jesus responds, then there's both the rebuke of the religious leaders being like, you know what miracles look like, you know exactly what's going on, you just don't dig it. There's also an exhortation to the people who are hanging around to be like, what are you going to do with all of this information? Narratively then, first and foremost, this is a parry and thrust. It's a counter attack from Jesus and it's aggressive. We could just take a little time to pause and appreciate how brilliant it is that Jesus consistently does not get suckered in to not good faith arguments from people who want to wreck him. We also got to roll on to acknowledging that second most, this is a question to the bystanders who are there. What would enough look like? What do you need to see? Again, I think about Luke 16. And how about that? We're in Luke 16 again, but for a different reason. And the story about Lazarus and the rich man, that story concludes with Abraham from heaven effectively saying, they don't listen to Moses and the prophets and they're not going to be convinced even if somebody rises from the dead, meaning that Jesus' official position, and this is very much supported by chapters 9, 10, 11 stuff, the theme about eyes to see and ears to hear Jesus' official position is some people just aren't going to see it. They're not going to see it. It's not going to happen. There is no amount of breaking the laws of time and space that is going to overcome those presuppositions because people get married to their presuppositions. Also, there's the underlying theme that it's God who opens eyes and shuts eyes. And we've acknowledged many times that that may be troubling or difficult to wrestle with, that there's a divide there between the mind of the divine, the power of the divine, and the perception of what is just and workable in the mind of the finite like you and me. But acknowledging that tension exists, the theme is inarguably pronounced eyes are going to be open, eyes are going to be shut, ears are going to be open, ears are going to be shut. Some people are going to see it. Some people aren't. The Pharisees and the Sadducees just don't seem to be seeing it as a group, acknowledging that we get an exception to that rule in John chapter 3 with Nicodemus. But here again, for the second day in a row, I've got to be a little bit sympathetic to the Pharisees and to the Sadducees because I don't know what would it take for me to just wad up and pitch all of my convictions. I'm not saying that you've got to hold the same ones as me or that I think you're dumb if you don't think the same stuff I do, but also unapologetically, I think some stuff. Just like unapologetically, you think some stuff, which is awesome. High five. Here we are, hanging out together just fine. But I don't know. I mean, we take a tremendous amount for something to happen and me to look at it and be like, you know what? Collectivism is the way to go. The best way to think about humanity is with central planning and people who know the best for all of us to take control of things and to move us around as need be in order to make the best society those elite central planners can imagine. I'm strongly convicted that the best we can do is by honoring and respecting the individual and the smallest minority in the world, which is the individual. That's a deeply held conviction on my part. I don't know what kind of a miracle or thing it would take for me to be like, nope, I totally just changed my mind. What I am saying is that I don't think the Pharisees and Sadducees are just idiots. I don't think they're just stupid people who don't get it. I think they have deeply deeply ingrained presuppositions and Jesus is acknowledging the reality of how deeply ingrained those things are. And for some people, maybe me included on a few points. It's hard to even imagine what we would have to see in order to change how we view things. Then on other things, I don't know, I think back on my life, I'm like, wow, I thought that pretty firmly. And then some stuff happened. And I did see it differently. So I don't know. I guess what I'm saying is I just want to resist the temptation to get too much on my high horse here. And imagine that if I had been a character in the Book of Matthew, when it first came out, that I would have been one of the good guys who saw everything crystal clearly and got it. I probably wouldn't have been still regardless of what it would look like if we control X ourselves out of this moment in history and control Veed ourselves into the story of Jesus. Regardless of all of those things, Jesus is still spit in truth here. He's still saying, look, you are intuitive people. You have the ability to look at a thing with your eyes and not lie to yourself. And then speaking as one who has shocking amounts of authority, Jesus then bounces the ball back into our court and is like, if you turn your intuition and your intellectual honesty toward what is happening right now, you will come to the right conclusions. So, so, so much more to break down on this passage. But I told you yesterday that I wanted to introduce you to something cool that I am very excited about today. And I'm just going to stick my toe in the water on that. I am working with a group called Africa Renewal. When stuff got crazy about a year ago, my buddy Destin and I from our other podcast called No Dumb Questions had the opportunity to rally a few things and try to be helpful with some work that was going on in Uganda. And I learned a little bit about this group as a result. And now I have learned a lot more. They do the thing where you effectively financially adopt a kid in Uganda and you help cover the basic expenses of them existing. We've committed to sponsoring a young lady named Monica and it's delightful getting to know things about her and seeing things that a little bit of money from us each month can do to improve her circumstances. We're going to talk more about that as the week goes along. But again, this group that I'm excited to introduce you to is Africa Renewal. You can check out their stuff at africarenewal.org slash TmbH. I'll tell you more about how all of that works and how we're partnering together in future conversations. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
