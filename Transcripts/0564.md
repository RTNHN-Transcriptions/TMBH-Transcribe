 What's up everybody? My name's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we're working through the book of Matthew right now. We are on pause between Matthew 23 and Matthew 24 because of the story of the temple, which dates all the way back to close to the beginning of the Old Testament. He's super important for understanding what happens next in the book of Matthew. We're in the home stretch right now of looking at that whole big story as we've been doing for several episodes. So I'm just going to pick up right where I left off yesterday. Well, eventually the Greek overlords who control Jerusalem, which at first were the Ptolemids who were mostly centered in Egypt, but around 200 BC they lost a big fight with the Seleucids who controlled Syria. And at that point, the Seleucid Empire absorbed Jerusalem into it. And these Seleucids were not so benevolent. And in fact, they were openly antagonizing toward the Jewish people and their law. And they tried to press Alexander's desire for cultural uniformity or Greekification on the Jews and the Jews didn't like it. This culminates in an incident where a Seleucid Greek king Antiochus Epiphanes goes and violates the temple and wants to make it a place of Greek pagan worship. And it's an absolute atrocity in the eyes of the Jewish people and they're right. It is a total violation of who they are and who God is and what the temple stands for. And this Antiochus Epiphanes clown just could not read the room. He invited on himself destruction and ruin. And then of course, famously, the Jewish people rise up and revolt under the leadership of the Maccabees as recorded in the intertestamental book of first Maccabees that some Christians historically look at and say, yeah, that's definitely Bible. Others look at it and say this is definitely valuable, but it doesn't rise to the same level as scripture whatever you make of it. The book of first Maccabees does speak directly to the situation. And it reads as follows, the history begins when Alexander the Great son of Philip of Macedonia marched from Macedonia and attacked Darius, King of Persia and Medea. Alexander enlarged the Greek empire by defeating Darius and seizing his throne. He fought many battles, captured fortified cities, and put the kings of the region to death. As he advanced to the ends of the earth, he plundered many nations and when he had conquered the world, he became proud and arrogant. By building up a strong army, he dominated whole nations and their rulers and forced everyone to pay him taxes, continuing verse five. When Alexander had been emperor for 12 years, he fell ill and realized he was about to die. He called together as generals, noblemen who had been brought up with him since early childhood, and he divided his empire, giving a part to each of them. Quick side note here, the contemporary historical data describes what happened with Alexander's death a little bit differently than what we get from this disputed intertestamental book, but I still think this is valuable continuing. Verse eight, after his death, him being Alexander, the generals took control and each had himself crowned King of his own territory. The descendants of these kings ruled for many generations and brought a great deal of misery on the world. The wicked ruler Antiochus Epiphanes, that's Antiochus Epiphanes, the fourth who we were talking about a little bit ago, son of King Antiochus, the third of Syria was a descendant of one of Alexander's generals. Antiochus Epiphanes had been a hostage in Rome before he became king of Syria in the year 137. Quick side note here, that year 137 that's being claimed there is not 137 BC, as we would count it, that is a year that is representative of a counting up from the first year that the salutids established their Syrian empire. So this would correspond with like 175, 180 BC, something like that. Just seemed like that could be a point of confusion. Thanks for indulging me continuing in first Maccabees. It's weird to say that 111. At that time, there appeared in the land of Israel, a group of traitorous Jews who had no regard for the law and who had a bad influence on many of our people. They said, let's come to terms with the Gentiles for our refusal to associate with them has brought us nothing but trouble. This proposal appealed to many people and some of them became so enthusiastic about it that they went to the king and received from him permission to follow Gentile customs. They built in Jerusalem a stadium like those in the Greek cities. They had surgery performed to hide their circumcision. No kidding. That's really what it says. Abandoned the Holy Covenant, started associating with Gentiles and did all sorts of other evil things. And then after that, we get the account of Antiochus fighting with the Ptolemids in Egypt. And then he turns his anger toward the Jews and this persecution starts that I was referencing earlier. And we get that whole account from this ancient document of first Maccabees. And then it rolls into the very nationalistic story of how the Maccabees family rose up in revolt against their Greek overlord. And eventually this leads to the establishment of a free and independent Jewish state, the Maccabees in dynasty or the Hestmonian dynasty. This is called. And this lasts until the middle of the second century, when after a century of dumb politics and infighting and failed policies, the Jewish throne is left very weak and vulnerable and is easily toppled by Pompey, the great of Rome, who comes in and establishes this sort of client-king relationship with Judea and eventually Galilee being two states controlled and governed by Rome as subject states. In the summer of 63, the defenders in Jerusalem against the Romans, against Pompey failed. They realized they were doomed and it sounds like a whole bunch of them committed suicide, which they considered to be a preferable option to the idea of seeing another foreign interloper come in and desecrate the temple once again, which according to one dead sea scroll did actually happen. The suggestion there is that Pompey's men offered sacrifices to their own military standards of their different military units in and around the temple. And history tells us that Pompey did enter the holy of holies and well, interestingly, in something that I think would have rattled the faith of a lot of people, he didn't die. So folks who looked carefully at the accounts of Ezra and Nehemiah and who had this lingering suspicion that maybe God wasn't dwelling in that temple quite the same way he was during the time of Solomon's temple. They have those suspicions confirmed by stuff that happened under the Greek rule of Antiochus Epiphanes IV and then further confirmed when an even more outsider, outsider Pompey rolls in from Rome and his men sacrificed to their own military logos and emblems at the temple and they don't die for it and Pompey walks into the temple and he doesn't die for it. And as if all of that wasn't rattling enough to them on top of that, Pompey has the whole temple cleared and cleansed, if you will, imagery we've talked about a few chapters back looking at the Book of Matthew and he appoints his own dude, kind of an outsider as his own puppet high priest. Very shortly after that, like within a decade, the Romans have their own political upheaval that occurs with the assassination of Julius Caesar. Pompey is already dead at this point. And because of the way things went down with Julius Caesar breaking all kinds of political norms, the idea of this old sort of democratic Roman Republic is just over. And with Caesar's death, there's another vacuum of power and now everybody scrambles to get it. And there's a civil war that develops between Antony and Cleopatra and Octavian who goes on to win and to claim the title Caesar Augustus. Caesar Augustus is the first emperor of the Roman Empire and he of course is the guy who calls for the censuses, one of which prompted the Holy Family to go to Jerusalem to be registered and now we're into the New Testament. Well, somewhere in all of that, a group of ethnic political outsiders from the fringes of Jewish territory find themselves in good graces maneuvering in the circles of leadership, nobility and court life in Caesar Augustus's court back in Rome. And this fellow named Antipater, the Idumian, the first of the Herod family, broke her some kind of deal where they get to be the ethnic effectively, like a local ish king who works with the Romans and in exchange gets all kinds of power to govern. Antipater's son is Herod the Great. Herod the Great, as we've discussed, is an enthusiastic builder who's always making stuff and he decides under the constant pressure of being viewed as an outsider and not a legitimate leader that he's going to curry some favor and make the temple great. And so he embarks on this massive, expensive expansion of the temple complex into the thing that was brand new and shining and beautiful and a wonder of the world that was in place when little kid Jesus got there with his family. And according to the book of Luke got left behind because he was debating and arguing in the temple with the religious leaders and dazzling everybody with his knowledge, even as a kid. This expanded version of the second temple then or Herod's temple, as some people called it that once again is the temple of the New Testament. And it is the temple that would eventually be destroyed by the Romans under Titus and the spation in 70 A.D. That is the building that was this glorious edifice that awed the disciples at the beginning of Matthew chapter 24. You know what my friends? If I hit pause right here right now, it is going to divide out just right for us to complete our tour of the story of the temple tomorrow. And then after that to get back into Matthew 24. So that's why I'm going to do it. We'll pick up right where we left off next time I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
