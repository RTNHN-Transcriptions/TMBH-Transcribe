 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Isaiah. We're into a new chunk of the Bible starting today. When you turn the page from Song of Songs to Isaiah, you aren't just turning the page from one book to another, you're turning the page from one genre to another. So far we've made it through three genres in the Old Testament. The first five books of the Bible associated with Moses, those are the Pentateuch. Then we get all of the history books that come after that, and then you get the wisdom literature that we've been looking at for the last few days, the Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, etc. Now we're into the prophets, and right off the bat, that term prophet is going to conjure different things for different people. I think the most common association with that term is the idea of predictivity that prophets know the future. They know things that they couldn't possibly know, and the only reason they know it is because of some kind of revelation from beyond, from the divine. And in storytelling and fiction, fantasy, things like that, you'll have the role of the prophet. In Shakespeare, you have the role of the prophet. In paganism, you have the role of the prophet. And most often there, again, we see that role being defined by the prophet's ability to know things they couldn't possibly know, and somehow being tapped into a source of knowledge from beyond the physical world to predict stuff. But in the Old Testament, that is just one minority feature that the prophets display. This office, this role of the prophet in the Old Testament, consistently comes with somebody being raised up by God to say difficult, brave things to people who usually don't want to hear it. But it isn't just predictive, in fact, I think the most common thing you see from the prophets in the Old Testament are statements of blessing and statements of judgment, guidance from God. They speak with authority to reveal God's perspective on things to a king, to a royal court, to the people, to the assembly, whatever it might be. And only occasionally in the Old Testament, do we get a hyper specific smoking gun, a highly testable prophecy that says exactly this thing is going to happen in exactly this way with these very specific details. And then you can come back and look at it and be like, well, did that thing happen or did it not a ton of those smoking gun style prophecies that we're going to see as we work through Isaiah and the rest of the prophets have to do with this one who's been hinted at through everything we've looked at through the first three genres of the Old Testament. That being this Redeemer, this promised king, this snake crusher, this one who is to come who's going to straighten things out and reign forever and be the centerpiece of God's redemptive plan for putting back together or maybe even betterifying what was originally there in the garden, but that then broke. So where does Isaiah fit into all of this? Well, he's the majorist of the major prophets. You'll hear people say major prophets and minor prophets that usually just has to do with the lengths of the books associated with these guys. But all of these prophets are associated with at least one king or one moment in the history that we've looked at already in the Bible. So for example, Amos is going to be associated with Jeroboam II. Hosea is going to overlap with a ton of the kings of the North. He's going to be able to say who is going to overlap with Manasseh in the southern kingdom of Judah. But Isaiah is an oddball because at least at first glance, it looks like he covers a massive amount of time overlapping with not only a whole bunch of kings, but also a whole bunch of time in exile and away what you could say that we get with Isaiah is three big prophetic scenes over the course of the book associated with his name. And the first of those scenes is in chapters one through 39. And in this scene, we see Isaiah doing what most of the prophets do on behalf of God, telling the people of Israel of Judah, hey, this isn't going well. This is a mess. This is not what God wants. And the way you guys have built in this case, Jerusalem is not going to work out. But there is this long term view presented here of this redemptive view of Jerusalem where everybody's going to show up just like the promise that God made to Abraham and they're going to be blessed through the children of Abraham. They're going to show up at the temple. They're going to learn about God. And there's going to be this vision for this new family of faith that is to come and some others personified in the idea of a new Jerusalem. In the midst of all of that, we meet Isaiah. Now we've already met him if we've read through the Old Testament because he crops up in second Kings in detail as he interacts with Hezekiah and some of the pressure points of Hezekiah's particular reign. But Isaiah shows up and there's this heavenly vision of God being like, man, stuff's a mess. But I got some stuff I need to communicate who will go. And Isaiah is like, wow, I'm not worthy, but I'll do it. I'll go. And then his lips, his mouth are purified symbolically literally, I don't know, by a hot coal, the idea being that what he's going to say is very trustworthy. It's been cleansed of the corruption of words that had happened here. And it's in this chunk that we start to run into language that is no longer vaguely pointing to Jesus or hinting at future things about redemption. This is the place in the Bible where we start to get into that Christmas time language, the stuff that you have heard again and again and again, the stuff that you sing in Christmas songs that is predicting much more specifically this future redemption. I think of Isaiah chapter nine. I mean, you've heard this, for to us, a child is born to us. A son is given in the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace of the increase of his government and of peace, though be no end on the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish it and uphold it. And it's not just me saying like, Oh, come on, they're talking about Jesus. The new Testament says, come on, he's talking about Jesus. I mean, there's one part of Isaiah that Jesus stands up, I think in Luke chapter four and reads from it in a synagogue, and he gets done. He's like, all right, well, today, what you just heard is fulfilled in your sight. He's clearly saying, I am the fulfillment of this stuff that Isaiah laid out that you've been looking forward to. And I'm not even scraping the surface of the Messiah language here in the first 39 chapters of Isaiah, which looked to be written during the later years of the southern kingdom of Judah before the Babylonians hauled them away into captivity. There's one more very important image for understanding the Old Testament and New Testament that happens here in the early going of Isaiah. And that's the image of God's judgment against his chosen people exemplified in this tree that gets cut down and all that's left is dead, burnout, trashed stump. And the promise that comes through Isaiah again with that glimmer of hope motif that we've seen all through the Bible so far is that there's going to be a shoot. There's going to be this little plant that comes up out of that stump that even though it looks completely dead, it's not dead. And it's going to grow up into this great, big, amazing thing. It looks in a way like Jesus is maybe drawing on that imagery in Matthew 13 when he gives the famous parable of the mustard seed and how it grows up into this great tree. And remember what happens when it grows up into that great tree? All the different critters and creatures and birds, they come and take shelter in it kind of like the imagery Isaiah was giving us about all the nations coming to God to learn about him and to worship. All of this hangs together. And one part that really hangs together is the last chunk of section one of Isaiah, which is chapters 36 through 39 where we get almost an identical blow for blow with stuff that's recorded in Second Kings about Hezekiah and his resistance to the Assyrians and how finally he comes around to trust God and God smites the Assyrian military camp and Judah is spared for the time being. But right after that, Hezekiah makes a big mistake when the Babylonians come to visit and he's like, check out all my money. Look at all of that. You guys aren't into like money or anything though, right? You would never come back and take it. No, no. Could we make sure to see all of it though? Yeah, for sure. It's really cool, right? And Isaiah comes along and he's like, idiot, you can't just flash all your money at great empires. They're going to want it. And I'm telling you, Isaiah says, it's not going to be too long and they're going to come back and they're going to take it and everyone away into exile. And that prediction marks the boundary between the first section of Isaiah and the next section of Isaiah, which runs from chapter 40 to chapter 48. And in this section, it gets a little bit tricky because there's a question of who are we actually hearing from here? Because it's written from the perspective of being in exile in Babylon, but that doesn't make any sense mathematically because of the human mortality and how long people can live. We know the Isaiah of chapters one through 39 is well dead by the time we would historically be in the environment. He's writing from an exile in chapters 40 through 48. When people look at that and say, well, it's a literary technique. Isaiah is projecting himself into this environment and writing as though he's in that environment. It's going to make a lot more sense when a few years pass and then people go back and read it while they're in exile and they're like, Oh, I totally get what Isaiah was saying now. And that absolutely could be. It could also be that there is this whole school, this whole tradition of thought born out of Isaiah and the people who came after him and studied under him that Isaiah wrote stuff down and maybe handed it on to them. And what we're getting is Christians believe more God inspired commentary from Isaiah's followers in interacting with prophecies Isaiah made back when he was alive. Whatever you make of it, it plays out the same way in the second section. We get details of God's promise about how he's going to do the things we read about in Ezra and Nehemiah where they're going to be liberated and sent back to rebuild the temple and this little spark of hope, this little shoot coming out of this burned out stump of the line of Jesse is going to grow into something much bigger. And now we're getting into the 50s in terms of chapters in Isaiah. And here we get a description of this servant who is going to come and it looks like this is the one who's promised, but the servant weirdly dies and dies at the hands effectively of his own people, the people who should have been excited to see the servant come. But then without any detailed explanation, the servant is alive again, resurrected and people who see what that means. I mean, they read between the lines and they're like, whoa, this is the sign of the coming of the kingdom. Like all the things are being straightened out. They register what's going on and they follow the leadership and the example of the servant, but a bunch of other people like, no, I'm just not into this and they reject him. And Isaiah makes it really clear that the right response is to assume a posture of service to the quote servant. And the wrong response is to reject that servant. All of this, of course, anticipates how we see things shaking out in the gospels and the story of Jesus. Well, then the very last chunk is this wildly hopeful description of the very distant future, the glorious victory of this servant and the arrival of the kingdom of God, the central theme of the book of Matthew. And that's why Matthew draws on Isaiah so much. And the way this victory is going to work out is that there's finally justice for all of the hideous stuff that we've seen so far in the history books of the Bible that we've been looking at. And then all of the horrible stuff that is ensued since then that you and I have read about in history books, that you and I have witnessed ourselves. Finally, that gets addressed and made right and judgment and a reckoning doesn't have to be the job of you and me. God sorts that stuff out. But then alongside that, there are a bunch of other people who also got a whole bunch of things wrong, but they realize they're wrong. They bend the knee to this great king. They become a part of this kingdom and they're a part of this eternal family of faith and worship and celebration of this king and his kingdom. And the whole thing is just like lobbying this gigantic fat, slow, softball forward into history, forward into the Bible to be absolutely knocked out of the park by Jesus and the gospels. Jesus story is recorded in the gospels is prophetic fulfillment on every one of those levels we were talking about at the beginning of our conversation. And Jesus says as much in Matthew 5 17, don't think I've come to abolish the law and the prophets. I didn't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. So he's rounding out the story. He's cleaning up the loose ends. He is the prophetic, predicted fulfillment of all those things that are measurable smoking gun prophecies. And this is especially abundantly clear throughout the beautiful, terrifying, but also hopeful book of Isaiah. When you visualize Isaiah picture his lips getting purified with that coal, picture the burnout stump of Jesse with a little tiny green chute coming out of it and pictured the mysterious servant, defeating death and establishing this beautiful new kingdom. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, this is going to take a minute, but it's worth it. Read chapters 49 through the end of the book and it's going to set the whole New Testament thing, the whole Jesus thing right up on a tee. I feel like we double leveled up. We get the prophet thing. We got the Isaiah thing. Maybe we triple leveled up because of how much all of this is going to pay off and help us understand the gospels when we get to those. Nice job. High five.
