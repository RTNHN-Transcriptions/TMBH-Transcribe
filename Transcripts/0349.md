 Hey, everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and I would like to make your life better by setting you up for success the next time you're one of those bar trivia night things. And ladies all up there, and she's been asking hard questions. You really need this point. And she's shuffling her papers for a super, super difficult one. And she's like, all right, got it. And she looks up all slow and coy. And she asks the following question. What is the one place in the New Testament where Jesus directly talks about pooping? And you slam on that buzzer and just yell Matthew 15 because you're going to be right. You're welcome. And then as soon as you're done with that, I want you to just live in slow motion for the next 10 or 15 seconds as you receive all of that adulation in the form of high fives from your teammates who just can't believe that you would know something like that. And then don't tell them, I don't need credit for this. I want you to fully own the thing and enjoy that. And I want you to think of it every time you look at that trivia night trophy that adorns your mantle place at home. It is like I'm not kidding. It is Matthew 15. I would not steer you wrong on something this important. And here's the lightning fast version of how we get to the place where Jesus talks about pooping in Matthew chapter 15. The super fancy elite Pharisees come up from Jerusalem to get after Jesus about doing things wrong. They yell at him about some hand washing tradition thing and he flips around is like, no, you guys are frauds and he lays out why and it's withering and it seems to hit home and is accurate. And Jesus invokes a prophetic criticism from Isaiah 29 that he directs at those Pharisees and Jesus turns to the crowds and he's like, Hey, look, what goes into a man's mouth doesn't make him unclean. But what comes out of his mouth, that's what makes him unclean. The disciples come into him and like, Hey, do you know the Pharisees were offended when they heard that? And Jesus does not care at all about their offendedness. Instead he replied, every plant that my heavenly father hasn't planted, it'll be pulled up by the roots, leave them. They're blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit. And at this point, you're like, this isn't that much fun. It sounds like what we were talking about yesterday. Like people are kind of frustrated and it's tense and you promised hysterical poop out takes. Don't worry. We're getting there. And then in verse 15, Peter said, I explained the parable to us. Are you still so dull? Jesus asked them. Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? See, I told you it was in there. But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart and these make a man quote unclean. For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. These are what makes a man unclean. But eating with unwashed hands doesn't make him unclean. Now, I understand that for some of you, a poop reference from Jesus is going to be one of the real highlights of the entire thing so far. And I understand that for others of you, this is going to be grossly disappointing. That said, let's break this whole thing down. So Jesus not offended, throws out this little micro parable back to the disciples. I guess the crowd was probably still in earshot, but he says every plant that my Heavenly Father is not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Now, if you've been hanging out with me for a little bit here, that should probably be setting off some alarm bells because Jesus makes a ton of references to agriculture and botany back here in chapter 13. So remember, chapter 13 opens with the parable of the sower, the guy who's sowing seeds all over the place. And some don't take it all and some grow up a little bit and they don't work out for various reasons and some grow up the right way and they produce a harvest and duplicate themselves multiple times over. And then you get the parable of the mustard seed, same kind of context there. And in between that, because of the way that chapter 13 is laid out, you also get the parable of the weeds. And I do think this parable in particular still would have been rattling around in the heads of the disciples and the original audience by the time we get to chapter 15. Because remember, this is the one where the master goes out and he plants a bunch of seeds, like I guess anybody would do to have a crop come in later on. But then along comes some enemy and he throws a bunch of bad seeds in there that look just like the good seeds and then they both grow up looking like each other. And the servant's like, what the heck are we supposed to do? They look exactly the same. I guess we should just go in there and start ripping everything up and we'll figure it out. And this is like, no, easy now. Let's give this a little bit of time when they both grow up, we'll be able to tell the difference and then we'll sort it out. And when the sorting out happens, I think this turn of a phrase in particular is what Jesus is harkening back to in Matthew 15 with this little bonus micro parable. And Jesus in the explanation of the parable is going to talk about this reckoning where it all gets sorted out thusly as the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. So it will be at the end of the age. So the very fresh parable of the weeds ends with a reckoning with stuff that was fake that was not sown by the master. Well, who sewed the seeds and weren't sown by the master? Let me go back over here. The one who sowed the good seed. That's the son of man. Okay, that's good. The field is the world and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. Okay, that's good by sown. But I'm looking for who sowed the other seeds, the weeds are the sons of the evil one and the enemy who sows them is the devil. Dang. Well, if we read Jesus remarks in the relatively immediate context here, you can understand why Jesus words in this little Matthew 15 parable are even more biting. He's saying the Pharisees are not the result of seeds planted by the father. Therefore, they're the result of seeds planted by the evil one. It's not like they're a value neutral, Jesus is saying. And their teaching is like, okay, also, and that's another way to do things religiously. He's saying straight up that straight from the devil. People who say that are making crap up because I have no idea what they're talking about and probably couldn't actually sort that out. If I were to spout off things like that, I'd probably often be wrong. But Jesus would know. And so he isn't being a jerk then in light of this when he says they're blind. If you follow them, you're going to end up somewhere very bad. Leave them. So Jesus is unapologetically driving a wedge. He has said now with full clarity and full confidence, the religious establishment is bad. It's wrong and it's dangerous and it's not from God. And you guys should completely bail on it. And here's a real gem. Peter comes back and he's like, wait, what? And there are a whole bunch of moments with Peter where I'm like, I cannot get after you, man. I wouldn't do better. Nobody would do better. This is tough. But maybe in this moment, I a little bit feel smug toward Peter and I shouldn't. That's not good. That's not right because I do think what Jesus just said is very, very clear. But where I feel empathy with Peter is that it was so jarring and so dramatic that even though it was crystal clear, Peter's like, ah, it's just that's too much. Like completely walk away from all of it. Like we can't try to hold both of these things in common. And even though if I count to five, I can muster empathy for Peter here. Jesus just goes, dude, what are you doing? Are you so dull? In other words, he's saying, you guys have seen enough. Remember like a minute ago when you walked on water? Remember that? Do you ever do that with those guys? Okay. So why are we asking questions, Peter? But in spite of Jesus disappointment that these guys still aren't tracking well enough, still goes ahead and answers the question forth rightly. And he says, don't you see that whatever goes into your mouth is going to come right back out? Like, I don't know how prudish or opposed to gross out poo poo fart humor. The people of the first century were, as I look around the Bible, I see actually tons of mild gross out humor or references. I think they were able to handle their business in this regard. But what I know, and maybe this was offensive. Maybe the turn of the phrase in the original language was very startling back then. Maybe Jesus was trying to shock Peter and the disciples here. But whether this was innocuous and would be a perfectly fine thing to say to someone or not, the point still holds. Some little fleck of dust that might have had some uncleanness on it that you didn't get washed off because you didn't properly wash your hands and let the water drain from your wrists and not your fingertips. Who cares? Like in the grand scheme of things that goes into your body and right back out the other end, it ain't that big a deal. But really what it serves as, according to what Jesus is saying, is a big distraction from things that actually are problematic. And he goes on verse 18, but the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. And these make a man unclean. And then he lists a bunch of stuff for out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. I mean, that's actually the kind of stuff that wrecks things that is destructive, that is antithetical to the values of the kingdom. And if you're so worried about ceremonial cleanness and uncleanness that you miss these things that are so obviously the opposite of God and the opposite of the kingdom, then your old religion is skewed. And that brings us back to it's a product of seeds that are planted by someone other than God because that is not reflective of the DNA of God, the values of God, the kingdom of God. So then Jesus wraps up and he says, that's what makes a man unclean, but eating with unwashed hands, that doesn't make him unclean. And then the anecdote resolves right there. And it doesn't seem like the disciples have any questions about that. It seems like Jesus turns a phrases and even invocation of the poop reference got through properly to help trivialize these nonsensical notions of clean and unclean. And the disciples are on board. In fact, I don't think we see a whole lot more moving forward. And maybe we'll find out that I'm mistaken or missing something, but I don't think we see a whole lot more moving forward where the disciples don't get it anymore. And they're like, well, maybe the Pharisees were right all along. We should try to hold both in common. Seems like this is a watershed moment for them in finally fully casting their lot with Jesus. And finally, if you do ever win a Bar Trivia Night trophy for knowing that Jesus referenced the excretory system in Matthew chapter 15, I just have to say you go to cooler Bar Trivia nights than me. And Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
