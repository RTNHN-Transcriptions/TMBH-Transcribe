 I think it would be fun today for us to talk about what we know about Esther and how it fits into the Bible in terms of the nuts and bolts of the whole thing. Right at the bat, we got a big question in that the book is anonymous. It doesn't name who wrote the thing. And indeed, there's never been agreement on who wrote the book of Esther. There are real smart people who look at that through the centuries and they're like, you know what? It just feels like this book was written by Mordecai. That's the cousin and closest ally of Esther in the story. There are other people who've looked at it and are like, eh, it kind of sounds like Ezra. I bet Ezra wrote that. And there's another tradition that says that elders gathered together and they took the traditions and the versions that were out there and they codified that into the one correct version of Esther. And however it happened, just as a side note here, Christians are not threatened by any of that. Christians believe that all scripture is God breathed, that it is inspired by God, but Christians do not believe that God somehow possesses the author and takes control of their hand, stripping them of their humanity and their context to dictate a direct message from God. There are moments like that in the Bible where it's held out as God directly relaying a message with his own literal words, but the vast majority of the Bible looks like it was written in conventional ways. A person sat down and wrote something or a person did some research like Luke and the book of Luke and Acts. And after they did all their research, they sat down and wrote it down or somebody wrote a poem or somebody went out and gathered a bunch of the best proverbs from a whole bunch of different cultures and authors or a few different authors contributed to the same book. Maybe the main author of a book died and some other author came along and was like, well, this book needs to have now that character died in here. So they add that to it. And at some point through a writing and editing process, just like all written things come about in the rest of the world, these books reach a final form. And then Christians believe by the supernatural guidance and power of God, these things become rightly regarded as the word of God and as scripture. So the idea that we don't know who wrote the book of Esther, that in a problem that fits squarely within the Christian theological understandings of how the Bible works, where it came from, the authority of the Bible and all of that stuff. But it's also worth noting that not only do we not know who wrote the book of Esther, we also don't know exactly when it was written. It was academically fashionable for a while there to say that Esther was maybe written way, way after the events it described, like getting almost close to the birth of Jesus. So you're talking to like the entire history of the United States of America after the events it describes. And that view maybe still has some traction, but a lot of evidence is surfaced. Good arguments have been made to say, I got to look at the way the language is structured. If it was written that late, there should be all this other stuff in the text, but there isn't. That looks more early Persian. Look at the details that are included historically and that aren't. If it was written way later, you'd think it would include all these other details. And then also there's just manuscript evidence to say, well, given what we know now about how much Esther had circulated and how well it was known, it really does make sense to locate the writing of this book much closer in history to the events it describes. And because the author of the book seems so familiar with Persia and assumes his audience is so familiar with Persia, it's most likely that it was written in the context of Persia within the boundaries of Persia during the time that Persia was still prominent, relatively close to the events it describes, probably within living memory of the events it describes. I think it's pretty evident that the main purpose of the book is to point to the sovereignty of God, even when his work is unseen. But the theme and the purpose of that book changes slightly if we go and look at some of the later additions to the book of Esther. As we've talked about, the book of Esther captured the imagination of a whole bunch of people over a whole bunch of generations. And as a result, people filled in gaps and wrote more stuff about Esther after the fact. This material is distinguishable from the original content. And once you get outside the 10 agreed upon chapters that we have here in front of us and that we're going to be looking at, there's not as much universal agreement as to what you do with this little bonus anecdote here, this little bonus anecdote here, or even how you order them or where you would put them in relation to the core text of Esther. And so if you go and grab a Bible from any of a few different historic Christian traditions, you will get a different batch of additional material about Esther. And that additional material, it talks about God a lot, prayer and a bunch of these things. And so thematically, it doesn't square with what we get with the core text of Esther. And in terms of the, here's a fancy word, provenance, that being the custody of the text, who had it when and what did it look like when they had it, the additions to Esther don't hold up super well, even into the late fourth century 80s. We're talking like 400 years, 375 years after the time of Jesus. You get this great Bible genius named Jerome. He's the guy who translated all of the Bible into Latin. And he looked at the manuscript evidence that was sitting out there and was like, all right, well, the Jews who were the custodians of the Old Testament, they don't have all of these bonus additions to Esther. They have the core text of Esther and the support behind the bonus additions to Esther. It's not great. And this is of a different flavor. And so Jerome relegated those bonus chapters of Esther to another place outside of the core text of the Bible. Now over time, for a whole lot of reasons that we're not going to get into today, Catholics, Orthodox, some oriental expressions of orthodoxy, some early expressions of Anglicanism, those groups all found different ways to incorporate different parts of that extra material about Esther into the book. And that makes it very clumsy when you go and try to read it. I am not a Catholic myself. I know some of you know that. Some of you don't know that. There's a whole lot about Catholicism that I just really dig and resonate with. I think we overlap on a ton of stuff, put it simply. If I agreed with every single detail of how Catholics think about things, I would be Catholic. I don't. And those are earnest convictions born out of my understanding of the Bible and born out of my understanding of church history. So instead born out of my convictions, I'm a Protestant, but one of my favorite things about my internet travels is that I get to hang out with my Christian brothers and sisters who are not Protestant and do come at it from a little different angle on some of those questions as well. And one of the places where the differences between Catholics and Protestants manifest is that Protestants go with the Jewish understanding of the book of Esther and Catholics go with the church's understanding of the book of Esther that evolved throughout the Middle Ages and then was codified in the mid 1500s. So if you pick up most modern translations, you're just going to get Esther chapters one through 10 just right in order and then the book is over. If you pick up a Catholic translation of the Bible though, the book of Esther opens with chapter 11 and it gives us a picture of a dream that Mordecai, that cousin, that ally of Esther has and then you move into chapter 12 and then you bounce back to chapter one and chapter one would correspond to chapter one in all modern translations. And a few different points as you thumb through the book of Esther, you will see that the chapter numbers are out of order. Those chapter numbers had been in place for a really long time before the decision was finalized within Catholicism regarding exactly how Esther would be handled. So a Catholic Bible is trying to give you a chronological read on the book of Esther just like what we get in the core 10 chapters. But because those additions to the book of Esther are sprinkled throughout the story, you just get a weird ordering of chapter numbers that might be disorienting but is sort outable if you happen to encounter the story of Esther in a Catholic Bible. I know for some Protestants and Catholics this question of exactly how the book of Esther and some other books like it in the Old Testament work is a point of contention and it's a sore spot. I am not interested in bringing it up for those reasons. I'm looking for allies and friends but also we are people of action. Lies do not become us and I think we should just be honest about the places that we disagree and do our best to sum up how we got to that point of disagreement and then move forward with what we're looking at. And what we're looking at in this series is the core historical text of the book of Esther as presented in the Vulgate, that translation of the Bible in the Latin in the 4th century A.D. and as read by the Jews of the past and the present. Y'all are always so gracious with me on potential points of disagreement like this. More on the nuts and bolts of the book of Esther and where it fits in the bigger Old Testament story next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon. Thank you to all of you who have taken the time to leave a rating and review on your podcast apps. It's helpful because it's encouraging and it helps new people find their way here.
