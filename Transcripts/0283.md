 A few years back my backyard flooded and so I had to bring in heavy equipment and dig this big drain and add all this drain rock and I had to re-grade my whole backyard. It was cool because I got to use an excavator and a skid steer and I'm working on that with my headphones on one day and Edge of Glory by Lady Gaga comes on while I'm in there working in my excavator and it's just so catchy and there's so much power in that excavator and I already had all the markings done before I dig so I could do whatever I wanted in the backyard and I was like you know what it's time. I'm going to go over here with this machine right now and I'm going to dig the trout pond that I drew in Miss Mack Mahan's third grade class when she had us draw our ideal dream home that we would want to have as an adult and I drew on with the trout pond in the backyard and I'm going to have that right now and I took the first shovel worth of dirt out and I was like yes I am on the edge of glory and then I dug more and I was like I'm on the edge here of glory and I dug this whole giant thing and I was like that this is perfect except it would be double perfect if it were twice as big and so then I dug even more and now I had a gigantic trout pond in my backyard with no plan whatsoever for how you run a trout pond or how you line it because I literally only thought of doing this just right then on the spot. So over the next few weeks there was a lot of work that went into learning about pond liners and ultimately I discovered that if I had stopped at the first hole I would have been fine because there were pond liners that are made for that hole that you can just order as a normal person but because I dug the second half of the pond I now had to make a gigantic seam that would make it so that two of these pond liners would cover the one chunk of pond and so I bought all that stuff and I put the seam in there and I put the sticky texture stuff on it and I filled it up with water and I was like that out of work and I just watched it drain before my eyes I was not even close. Oh man so I pay for all this other stuff and I get the like what do you call it the stuff they advertise on TV where the guy takes the black slime and he puts it over a screen door and then he can use it as a boat because it seals everything up I bought that stuff and I painted over all of it and I filled it back up with water and now it drained super fast except there were little chunks of black goop floating all over the place that I had to go through and pick out my hand and this pond turned out to be a metaphor that is equal to chasing your problems and creating more problems that could only be equaled by that the old lady who swallowed the fly song it was comical how much money and time I squandered on this thing before eventually I did figure it out and made for a really cool beautiful pond in my backyard and to this day I blame Lady Gaga for all of that but the point is and yikes I just burned two minutes and 30 seconds of our time together on that haha you're very long suffering the point is that we all have multiple examples in our lives of seeing a problem and then trying to fix it and thinking that we've got it all mitigated and then in the end it turns out that all of our mitigation just made the thing much much worse than it actually was in the first place and in Matthew chapter 12 Jesus rounds out this massive flow of thought that could be argued to arc all the way back into Matthew chapter 11 he rounds out all of it by describing a situation like that as it pertains to people thinking they have their soul cleaned up and tidied up and rid of the evil spirits the demons that they're dealing with and then it turns out that despite all of that seemingly effective mitigation things are actually worse than they were in the first place and in order to make sense of how that fits into the flow of all of this we're just going to have to break it down so this lightning summary takes us all the way back to the beginning of chapter 11 Jesus disciples have just come off their big open world quest it sounds like it maybe went okay but John the Baptist who is now in prison the forerunner of Jesus sends his disciples to go and catch Jesus and be like hey are you actually the Christ is kind of confusing because big explosive things we thought were going to happen aren't yet but Jesus is like no pretty cool stuff's happening go back and tell John the blind are receiving sight the lame walk those are of leprosy are cured the deaf here and a bunch of other cool stuff happens and then Jesus goes on to defend John and then Jesus goes on to criticize this wicked skeptical generation that he's dealing with right now he criticizes Bethseta and Corazine Capernaum the little towns around which he was working saying if these cruddy Gentile towns had seen the stuff you guys have seen they would have repented they would have got this right from the beginning there's something wrong with all of you and then he flips it around and ends it on the positive note at the end of chapter 11 by thanking the father for the unity between the father and the son and the responsibility that the father is imparting to the son and then he concludes chapter 11 much the same way he concludes chapter 9 with a statement of pity on these very frustrating crowds the very frustrating people of this generation by saying come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me from gentle and humble in heart and you'll find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light very next thing after this nice comment it's too ugly Sabbath controversies with the religious leaders they decide that they can't win at that kind of fight so they're just gonna murder Jesus Jesus strategically withdraws people follow him out there there's a demon possessed man they bring to him Jesus heals him the guy's blindness and muteness and demonness goes away the people are like you're probably the Messiah the Pharisees are like you're probably in league with Satan Jesus shoots down their stupid argument calls him a brood of vipers says they have ugly stuff within them that is boiling to the surface this happens in front of everybody the Pharisees try to save face by saying what oh no sorry our bad no just show us a sign please and Jesus like I did I did we just we we not just do a sign like one second ago and he calls them a wicked and adulterous generation so we're back to that same language of chapter 11 about there's something wrong with the mindset of these people and he talks about how that wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign but they're not going to get any sign except the sign of Jonah which is this preview of Jesus death and his resurrection then he pivots from Jonah to the town Jonah went to Nineveh saying the people of Nineveh are going to stand up and judge you all who are here right now because the preaching of Jonah was vastly inferior to what you're hearing in me and they got it and the queen of the south the queen of Sheba she'll be there to condemn you as well because she sought out Solomon's wisdom and understood things from that and you're hearing something much wiser right now now Jesus is going to round out this verbal sandwich with the slice of bread on the back end that takes us back to the precipitating event that got us here in the first place and that is talk about demons and the state of this generation he says this verse 43 when an evil spirit comes out of a man it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it oh okay so maybe this is something everybody knew maybe this was news to them my guess is this would have sounded like common knowledge to the original audience that when evil spirits get cast out they go somewhere we have an example of them going into some pigs earlier in Matthew but where did they go if they don't get sent into pigs I guess just out to the desert or something so okay then it says then it the evil spirit that is says I will return to the house I left when it arrives it finds the house unoccupied swept clean and put in order okay house here is clearly a metaphor for the individual who has been delivered from demonic possession now their life is in order stuff looks good their metaphorical house is all tidied up and that just makes it way tidier and prettier for the evil spirit I guess and Jesus says then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there and the final condition of that man is worse than the first and there we come full circle that what I was talking about in my 19 minute introduction about my stupid trout pond and the lady Gaga song the point of which again is that we've all tried to mitigate very ugly things thought we got it figured out and then later figure out that all we did was make it way worse than it was in the first place at least on one level the idea that Jesus is communicating and what he's speaking to hearkens all the way back to what happens earlier in chapter 12 where he's pointing out that hey you Pharisees you cast out demons too and who do you cast those out by by God or do you cast them out is it by Satan like you accused me of and on the one level I think that harkening back suggests that Jesus is in toning that their exorcisms are not efficacious and that this religious act that symbolizes their effectiveness and their authority as spiritual people and spiritual leaders is actually specious and that though it might look like they've mitigated the problem they haven't mitigated the problem all they've done is exacerbated the problem both when it comes to a literal evil spirit and a metaphorical evil spirit or spiritual failure in general then Jesus rounds out the passage saying that is how it will be with this wicked generation so on a second level it would seem that Jesus is rounding out the larger two chapter thought which is his condemnation of the failure of the thought processes of this entire place and time in the world and if that's the case you could argue on the one hand that Jesus thought there and his condemnation of this wicked generation is a rounding out of the second half of Matthew chapter 12 or you could make the case that this goes all the way back to his conversation with John the Baptist and the rebuke that he gives the crowd who's hanging out there when he says stuff to what can I compare this generation they're like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to others we played the flute for you and you didn't dance we sang a dirge and you didn't mourn it feels like that same demanding I want to sign I want you to do it this way thing that Jesus is taking apart verbally in Matthew chapter 11 that he's again taking apart verbally in Matthew chapter 12 so structurally what we've got here is either two parallel sets of thoughts one that is more targeted as we discussed yesterday at the larger wicked generation the mindset the culture and the second of which is more targeted specifically at the religious leadership or it could be argued this is all one big flow of thought and then maybe you could even make a case for Matthew having a sixth big speech around which his book is built that being whatever we call this thing the condemnation of the wicked generation and its leaders speech maybe in Matthew chapters 11 and 12 what I'm finding in this thing that you and I are building together is that at times we get into really fun narrative this guy said this that lady said that this guy said that kind of storytelling stuff and it's dramatic and it's fun and other times I suppose we're trying to get more into Matthew the author's head to try to see what we can glean from what he's doing here editorially and structurally what I find is days like today where we've got narrative and prose and we're trying to understand what Matthew is doing structurally these conversations can get a little bit heady and a little bit challenging but hopefully it's rewarding even if it takes a little bit longer to digest and if you do need to digest it further you know put this thing on again when you're on the treadmill later or on the commute back home and process further and go and let me know on the subreddit what you make of all of this too I'd enjoy that tomorrow we're on to something much more straightforward but also much more controversial and I think it's going to be interesting and fun and instructive thanks for hanging out with me
