 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. And when you watch sports long enough, you get familiar with them and you start to learn the ebb and the flow and what looks confusing at first, gradually with whatever sports or sports are familiar to you, eventually takes shape. And you're like, oh, I understand exactly why you do that. And you start to feel the rhythms of it yourself. And one of the sports that I absolutely love to play and watch is ice hockey. It's a glorious sport. It's violent and beautiful and artful and involves teamwork and creativity and interaction with a surface we hardly ever interact with. This is a great game. But one of the things you'll notice when you start watching hockey is that every now and then it feels like one team will have an offensive advantage. They have the puck. It looks like they have the ability to move into the scoring zone and put pressure on the opposing team on the opposing goalie, but then they don't. Instead of doing that to the newcomer to hockey, it looks like the offensive team inexplicably just chucks the puck down into the offensive zone slowly to let it rattle around and they don't even chase it. Well, what's with that? Why? The answer is because sometimes it doesn't benefit you in the ebb and flow of hockey to relentlessly throw all of your energy at the net all the time. You see in hockey, you don't have timeouts to change players. I mean, occasionally there are stoppages in play, but you can freely swap out players while play is occurring. This is one of the beautiful things about the game. Well, after so much time of skating around, your movement shifts from something that occurs with your hips and your lower body to something that is your legs get tired, moves up into your low back and you can sway for momentum. And when you do that, you're slow, you're not agile, you're not very good at hockey and you risk injury. That is why there are constantly what are called line changes in ice hockey as players come and go. Well, if you're at the end of a really long shift where you've taken a beating and you've worked hard and maybe you recovered the puck and you have the opportunity to go into another offensive shift, sometimes the ebb and flow of the game just says, that's too long on this shift. The offensive team, once again, will dump it down into the zone to buy themselves time to rearrange what they're doing as a team so that they're fresh and they're ready to go. Likewise, in the book of Matthew, in the general account of what happened in the life of Jesus, he keeps seeing these line changes, these strategic withdrawals where you're like, Jesus, you are kicking butt. Everything is going awesome. You can't be stopped. You know everything. You've power of time and space and nature. You're unlimited in every way. Your message is great. You're an incredible communicator and then something will happen. And instead of Jesus continuing to rush forward into the offensive zone to tell people about how the things are and solve the problems and heal people and do miracles, he withdraws. Well, in the same way that in hockey, that might look like it makes no sense, but the more you get to know it, the more you realize that made a ton of sense. So in the ebb and flow of Jesus public life upon closer examination, these handful of strategic withdrawals actually make a ton of sense. This episode represents what I believe is the second time we've talked about these strategic withdrawals, but I promised you last time it came up that there were a bunch more to come and that we were going to come back and look at this song. I got a Bible here. I bring that with me to this particular event. And the first one of those I want to point out is in Matthew 2, 14, this is a decision involving Jesus made by his dad. So Joseph finds out is warned in a dream, what's going on with Herod, the great who wants to murder all the babies and says, so he got up, took the child as Jesus and his mother, and it's Mary, during the night and left for Egypt where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled and some stuff from the Old Testament. On the one hand, we might look at this passage and say, well, I don't know. So he dies. He was going to die in the end anyway, didn't he come to die for the sins of humanity? I mean, what difference does it make if this Herod gets him or some other Herod gets him? Well, the answer is it makes a ton of difference because he hasn't done all the stuff that he was going to do yet and people wouldn't have understood or recognized what he was there to do yet. It just wasn't Jesus time to die. So on the other hand, a strategic withdrawal here makes sense. Jesus, God and Joseph and Mary are planned to win the hockey game. They're just not going to score the game winning goal at this particular moment. So instead dumping the puck and resetting the play is what makes the most sense. And over here in Matthew eight, we've got another one of these incidences right after the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus goes and he heals people and he does a bunch of stuff. And then in verse 18 of chapter eight, it says, when Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. And then a couple of people come up and one of them is like, Oh, I'll follow you wherever. And she's like, well, I'm homeless. And another guy comes up and he's like, wow, let me go bury my dad. Then I'm going to follow you forever. And Jesus is like, follow me and let the dead bury their own dead. And we broke down those difficult sayings a while back. But then after those exchanges, Jesus follows through on his plan for the strategic withdrawal. He gets into a boat. His disciples followed him and they go to the other side of the lake and there's a miracle out on the lake and there's a miracle on the other side of the lake and people want him to go away again. And so this strategic withdrawal from the crowds over to the other side of the Sea of Galilee leads to another strategic withdrawal away from the people who don't like the miracle he performed by putting demons in pigs. So now what we see is that back to back long metaphorical shifts that Jesus is out on both end with a line change, a strategic withdrawal and a resetting of what he is up to Matthew chapter 12 and verse 15. And people get real mad about the Sabbath. This comes on the heels of the grain on the Sabbath day controversy and the guy with the withered arm being healed on the Sabbath day controversy. Matthew 1215 aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him and he healed all of their sick, warning them not to tell who he was. This was to fulfill some more stuff that happened in the Old Testament. So again, it looks like Jesus could press his case here and just defeat the religious leaders. He has the power of God on his side. He could win the fight right now, but instead it's like, this is not when we're going to score the game winning goal. And further, they want to murder me right now. Is it possible that they could have succeeded in murdering him? Well, politically, I mean, apart from the intervention of God, yeah, I guess it was possible. And again, we could say, well, he's going to get killed at some point by these leaders. Anyway, why not just do it now? Well, the work isn't done. He hasn't communicated everything he wanted to communicate about the kingdom. He hasn't demonstrated miraculously all of the authority that's behind the kingdom. It's just not time to get killed yet. And so he strategically withdraws and people follow him. And as we're seeing in Matthew 14 that we're working on right now, he doesn't even get mad that people follow him. He has compassion on them skipping ahead to Matthew 14, which is where we are right now. After the execution or really murder of John the Baptist, Jesus hears about it and says, when Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns. When Jesus landed and saw the large crowd, he didn't get all mad and grouchy and angry that they were bothering him while he was busy being sad. Instead, that part isn't in the Bible. This part is he had compassion on them and healed their sick. And then one page away in chapter 15, after another contentious exchange with the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, Jesus is going to withdraw even further this time. So what are we at? Verse 21 is, yeah, here we go. Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. It's way far away. He's clear up north now. And then a Canaanite woman from that vicinity comes up and that's a whole story that will be fun to unpack later on. Additionally, I suppose we could look at the stuff at the end of chapter 13, where Jesus goes to Nazareth, people aren't really into it. They start to resent him and feel bitter about it. And he doesn't do many miracles there because of their lack of faith and he just moves on. But Jesus didn't just model the strategic dumping of the puck and line change and strategic withdrawal technique. He also explicitly told his disciples to do it back there in Matthew chapter 10 in the missional discourse where, remember, he tells them, like, yeah, you go to this town and if they're down with it, like, great, then, you know, your hospitality rests on them. You hang around if they're not into it and they want you gone, cool. Just dust off your feet and move on to the next thing. Why does all of this strategic withdrawing matter? One, it demonstrates the humanity of Christ. He gets beat up. He takes shots. People want to murder his very mortal, killable body. He does strategic things to respond as an individual to those pressures, to that grief, to that emotion. He also does strategic things to make sure that he doesn't get murdered, which is supposed to ties into the second reason he does this, which is narratively. There is a very clear theme throughout all of the gospels and all of the Bible that there is this progression and unfolding of time that is all very intentional on the part of God. And the text makes it very evident that Jesus wasn't supposed to be dead yet. He was supposed to die a certain way at a certain time under certain circumstances to accomplish a certain thing. Works not done. It's not time to die yet. There you go. A third reason for these strategic withdrawals is that I think they're all a microcosm of the larger theme throughout all of the Book of Matthew and that comes up a ton in the New Testament. And that is the theme of God making a covenant with Abraham way back in the Book of Genesis that says, I am going to make a great nation out of you and all this stuff's going to happen and the nations will be blessed through you. Well, then what we find out as we look at all of this is that the chosen people are not really up for being that dance partner anymore. The long awaited Messiah shows up, does all the things that the Messiah is supposed to do according to Matthew chapter 11 and a big chunk of the people who are supposed to be the ones who work hand in hand with the Messiah to present this kingdom to the larger world and be a blessing to all the Gentiles as was agreed upon in their foundational charter, the covenant with Abraham, they're just not up for it. And so as modern Gentile readers, we tend to gloss over how much, especially the Book of Matthew is dealing with the reality that Jesus is saying, this is going to go to the Gentiles, even a huge percentage of the parables that we as Gentiles might like to extrapolate out into slightly different meanings that have more to do with us. Really, if you look at the way they would have been initially understood by the people to whom they were spoken, they were parables clarifying God's patience and God's work and how God is fully aware of the rejection of the king that is going on here and that he's going to do the work anyway and that if he invites all the fancy people who were invited in the first place to come to the banquet and they're like, I don't really want to do it anymore. He's not going to cancel his banquet. He's going to invite other people and they're going to be the guests of honor instead. So in a way, thematically, theologically, the whole narrative is unfolding as a strategic withdrawal, not that God is ultimately in finally rejecting his people, but that God is blowing the gates wide open and making this thing accessible to everyone on earth, whether his chosen people are into it or not. Hopefully, the further along you and I go in this thing, the more we start to detect these motifs and as we take these aside episodes to go and run down these repeated motifs, hopefully, we collect more and more of those motifs that are now pinned up on our mental bulletin board that has all of the components of Matthew front and center so that with each passing passage, each passing chapter, we are more equipped to notice those motifs and more deeply understand all of the layers of meaning that are packed into the words and actions of Jesus and to the writing of Matthew. In the same way that the glorious game of hockey requires from time to time what looks like an offensive strategic withdrawal. So, the public ministry and the life of Jesus requires from time to time what looks like a strategic withdrawal. If we keep that in mind, theologically and narratively, that motif is going to help us understand the ebb and flow of the gospel of Matthew and understand the whole dang thing that much better. Last thought, I hadn't gone and looked at reviews for quite a while and I wouldn't notice that a bunch of you left really kind reviews on various podcast apps, Apple and podcast addict and other places. That's really awesome. It's super fun unwrapping those. It's like Christmas morning for me and thank you all for being so dang nice and encouraging. I appreciate all of that. And on that note, we'll wrap it up there. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
