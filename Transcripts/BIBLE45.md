 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Romans. As we turn the page in the book of Acts to the book of Romans, we are getting into a whole new genre, a whole new mode of the Bible. With the New Testament, we've got the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. I'll tell the story of Jesus in different ways, for different audiences, with different points of emphasis, leaning into different things to achieve what they're trying to achieve. It gives us a very thorough picture of how Jesus is and what he did and what the point is of what he did. It also sets the trajectory for this eyes up, arrows out, always forward movement in the building of this kingdom, of this new family of faith. When we see how that plays out throughout the book of Acts, as a whole bunch of people latch onto this impulse and go and do what they're supposed to do. But when we get done with the book of Acts, that's the end of narrative stuff in the New Testament. As we turn the page over to the book of Romans, what we see is that now the first couple sentences sounds like a letter, because it is a letter. The Romans one opens with Paul, a servant of Christ to Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God, the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures regarding his son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David. Whoa, we're off and running here. We just learned a bunch of things. One, our suspicions are correct. This is indeed a letter to if we go down a few more verses, it says to all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints. Okay. So it's written to Christians in Rome, which means that three, we can deduce that we must be talking about Jewish people because in the very early church, most of the Christians were Jewish people. But also we must be talking to Gentile Christians. I mean, the book of Mark was written to Romans and that would have included a bunch of Gentiles. The day of Pentecost happened in Acts chapter two. And there's a church in Rome, which is not really a Jewish town. So this is interesting. This letter is being directed to a mixed audience church of Jews and Gentiles. Wonder how things are going over there more on that in just a minute. For we figure out real quick that this Paul fellow is going to factor heavily. Now we learned a lot about Saul who came to be called Paul in the book of Acts. He was the super zealous Pharisee who attended the execution of Stevens, Muggly sat there holding everybody's coats so they could get their arms limbered up and mobile so they could better whip rocks at a guy and illegally execute him like savages. Paul is right there the whole time being like, yeah, this is great. This is how things ought to be. This is awesome. This is why I signed up for church and religions. We could hit people with rocks like this is exactly how I want things to be. And it's so good. I want to take this show on the road. And so Paul, Saul is the one who volunteers to go up north. I'm going to round up some Christians and some of these other little Christian hotbeds and we'll do some more of this rock killing and arresting and stuff. But it's on his way up to Damascus that he has this encounter with the risen Christ. Then he's changed forever. Then he becomes the apostle of Jesus, especially to the Gentiles. Enter the book of Romans. Well, there's an emperor named Claudius and he had bigger fish to fry than Jewish problems and instability in the capital city of Rome. And in a fit of frustration at one point, he just kicked all the Jews out and he's just get out of here, be gone. You guys are a pain in my butt in Judea. The last thing I need is all of that tension here in my backyard. So Claudius just kicks him out in the grand scheme of all of the exiles we've seen so far in the Bible. This one is pretty paltry. The Jews were allowed to come back pretty quickly. But that is enough time for some factions to develop in Rome. You got a bunch of Gentile Christians. And when they look at the Old Testament, all they see is stuff that points to Jesus. Prophecies fulfilled. This is really exciting, but the Jewish Christians, when they returned from being exiled and now they're back in the church in Rome, what it looks like, they're kind of mad about stuff because they're looking at these Gentile Christians. I mean, like you guys are being flippant. We got all these rules and obligations and you guys are going to need to do those or you're just not taking it very seriously. That is the situation into which Paul is writing this letter to the Romans. And Paul is trying to get the church in Rome to get along. One, because Jesus prayed that all of us would be one just as he and the father are one back in John 17. But also Paul is trying to accomplish something here and squabbling is getting in the way. He wants to reach the entire Roman world with the message of Jesus and invite people into this new family of faith and established churches all over the place. So he's got his eyes set on the Roman province of Hispaniya, modern day Spain. And he's going to need the support of a unified healthy Roman church to make that trip. So you got those two motivations for writing the letter. But then the third motivation is that Paul is absolutely convinced this whole Jesus thing and that there's life and salvation in it. And clearly he believes that what's going to bridge the divide and heal the damage and division in this church is simply to spell out what the basic message is, what the gospel message is, the heartbeat of the message of Jesus in a way that they're all going to explain and in a way that anticipates the questions that they're going to have. Now about halfway through chapter once in the pretty early going, Paul lays out the thesis statement for this letter, which would have been read aloud to everybody there. And it goes like this, I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. See what he's doing there for in the gospel, a righteousness from God is revealed a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written, the righteous will live by faith. He's thrown down the gauntlet and said, I'm going to demonstrate that there is a righteousness that makes us right with God that is not from how well we can obey rules, but it is by the work of Christ and it is given to people by God through faith. That is very different than how Jewish Christians had been thinking about their relationship with God prior to this. This is very dense, very complex theology throughout the book of Romans. And I don't think I can cram it neatly into this amount of time, but the big picture goes like this. Paul makes the case that everybody, not just the Jews, not just the Gentiles, everybody has that stain of sin on them. These failed the test. Everybody has got that deep into their roots. Our hearts are corrupt and broken. They want sin. And further, Paul argues, we can't fix it through effort. We've had a billion different attempts, a bunch of different paradigms we've tried for people to really get it right and really come around this time and actually do the right thing all the time. So much that God likes it and is impressed. Paul's like, no way, it's never happening. We got a massive sample size and we know our own hearts. It can't be achieved. We need then a righteousness that is apart from the law. Now Jesus hinted at this and more than hinted at it, right at the beginning of his public ministry in Matthew chapter five, when he's saying, look, I didn't come to abolish the law and the prophets. I came to fulfill them. And by law and prophets there, he doesn't just mean the rules of the Old Testament. He also means the whole story of what you and I called the Old Testament, but then Jesus goes on to say that, you know, your righteousness would have to surpass that of the Pharisees, the very people who get to make the rules in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. And so what Jesus is saying there is there's going to have to be a righteousness that comes from God because it's unattainable by human effort. Well, that's Paul's opening argument as well. We all got this problem and we can't fix it through proper behavior, self control. That will not make us righteous in the eyes of God to God's standards. But then Paul pivots to good news. This is why Jesus, the Messiah came. It wasn't to kill the Romans and get rid of the emperor. There's a whole different kind of kingdom that was going to be built on his sacrifice on the cross where the Messiah takes on the sins of the world, takes on all of that brokenness and he absorbs the punishment. Later on, Paul is going to say in 2 Corinthians that he became sin for us, even though he knew no sin, so that by him, you and me, we might become the righteousness of God. You see, Paul is drilling this point that we are made right with God, not by stuff we do. We are made right with God by the work of Christ. And this work of Christ in the life of the believer transforms the state of being of that Christian from being an enemy of the kingdom of God, to being a part of the family of God, a son, a daughter, a child, an heir to this kingdom, an agent of this kingdom with responsibility in this kingdom. It's a total transformation that occurs and it's all because of the work of Jesus. And this again is that new family of faith, the completion of the family of faith idea that we see in the Old Testament. It's that new paradigm. But then that raises the question like, well, what gives? Did God screw up with the whole law thing? Is this version 2.0? And he just didn't have his strategy together the first time around. But now with the Jesus thing, it's going to work out while Paul is saying, no, not at all, because humanity wouldn't have understood how given over to sin, how absolutely broken our situation was without the law to point out our inability to achieve this righteousness that is required to be in the kingdom of God on our own. The law points out how badly we need a righteousness that is apart from the law and that is given to us by God, the only one who actually is righteous. And the only one who actually has that to give away. And then Paul goes on to argue that when we get that righteousness from God, now for the first time ever, humans are equipped with a new heart that is able to obey God for the right reasons by the presence of his spirit in the life of transformed people. So we said all throughout the Gospels, we said at the end of the Old Testament, this situation is begging for a new paradigm in the relationship between God and man. And here Paul is explicitly spelling out a new paradigm for both Jews and Gentiles alike. Then the closing third of the book, Paul starts to land the plane. He's like, look, in light of all of this, in light of what the gospel is, here's how it makes sense to live publicly. Here's how it makes sense to treat each other. Here's why it makes sense for there to be peace among us. And Paul is saying, I'm giving you a theological rationale for this that is drawn from everything that is about Jesus and everything that is about the work of the spirit and everything that is about the Old Testament. I'm not just making stuff up like a college freshman is like, come on, guys, let's just try peace. Can we please just get along? This new family of faith is genuinely special. It's backed by God. God is among us and we can have peace in a way that is transformative for us and the people who see what's going on with us outside of our boundaries. It's so dang good. It's so well argued. I hope you'll read the whole thing. Really, if you don't have time to read any other book in the entire Bible, my recommendation would be to get, well, I'd say get John and then get Romans. These are the two that really lay out what it looks like and what the rationale is behind it for how you or I respond in this day and age to what Jesus is doing and where we fit with all of that. When you visualize the book of Romans, picture a new heart, one that was broken, but one that has been made new and reborn in Jesus. When you think about the theme, we'll just go right back there to Romans 1, 16 and 17. The gospel is the power of salvation for everyone who believes for in it. There's a righteousness from God. It's a righteousness that is by faith from God and the righteous will live by that faith. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get chapter 1, verses 16 and 17 that I keep referencing. Then hit Romans 3, 23, Romans 3, 10 through 18, Romans 6, 23, Romans 5, 8, Romans 10, 9, Romans 10, 13, Romans 5, 1, Romans 8, 1, and finally Romans 8, 38 through 39. I know that's a lot, but we're going to put all of that down in the show notes so you can reference it there. And with that, Romans achievement unlocked. First Corinthians next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
