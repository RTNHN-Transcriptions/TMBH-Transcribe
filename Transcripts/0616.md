 I watched the situation unfold some time ago where a dude had a managerial, directorial role in a company in a project. And I don't know the guy personally, but from a distance, it was really easy to see that it was just a mis-hire. The guy just didn't understand the exercise, didn't understand the point of the organization that he was with. And then as a result, it really didn't work. And his shortcomings weren't character or competence. He had both of those things. It's just not getting it. And I watched the people who were supervising him try again and again and again to explain, no, no, no, this is your job. Be creative. You're vested here. You're supposed to build this thing. And he just didn't understand and ultimately it didn't work out. And that's okay. Sometimes jobs don't work out and sometimes people get hired into positions where it's not a good fit and it doesn't make sense. And again, the reason it didn't work out was because of a fundamental not understanding of the orientation of the purpose of the point of the role that this position was supposed to have. Likewise in Matthew chapter 25, the issue that the master seems to have in the parable of the talents is that the first two guys he invests in, giving them five talents and two talents respectively, I mean, they at least get it. I don't think I could get a hundred percent return, but they both do. And one gets five talents earned on the five talents he was vested with. The other gets two talents earned on the two talents he was trusted with. So I mean, they did a phenomenal job, but at the most basic level, they understood the exercise. The exercise is, Hey, I'm a master of a household and I want my household to grow and I have to do other tasks that are away from here. And I want you to be vested in this and I want you to grow with me. So here, take these resources of mine and turn them into more stuff and let's just build this whole thing and you have a role in it. And they got it. But as you know, there's another guy who just got one talent and the master knew this dude maybe wasn't totally ready for prime time. The text indicates that and he gave one five talents, another two, and another one each according to his ability. So the master understood the risk he was taking with a sizable investment and with one talent guy, it did not pan out. Why? Well, I think we figure out why in the text when the master comes back to settle up accounts with everybody, five talent guy, that's awesome. You have five back come into my household and share in my happiness to talent guy. Awesome. You got to that's unbelievable. Come on in and share in my happiness. Then the man who had received one talent came master. He said, I knew you're a hard man harvesting where you haven't sown and gathering where you haven't scattered seed. So I was afraid and I went out and hid your talent in the ground. See here's what belongs to you. His master replied you wicked lazy servant. So you knew that I harvest where I have its own and gather where I haven't scattered seed. Well, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers. So then when I returned, I would have received it back with interest. Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the 10 talents for everyone who has will be given more and he'll have an abundance. Whoever doesn't have even what he has will be taken from him. Why is the master outraged? Remember the last couple of days we talked about one of those reasons being that the one talent guy not only completely failed, but he blamed the master and effectively accused him of being a thief and pewnd his character and held that out as being the reason he failed. I couldn't make any money. I don't know how these other two guys did it. I mean, probably lucky, but knowing how you are, I mean, what could I possibly have done? I mean, just look at how things are right now. I had no option here other than to just bury the thing and that did not work on the master at all. But I think the second reason for the master's justified outrage is that the deal was pretty evident. And apparently it was evident enough for the other guys to get it, but one talent guy for whatever reason just couldn't understand the exercise. The exercise is once again, the master's going away. The master's household and the master's resources need to be working to further the master's agenda and the master's household while he is gone. You are vested with playing a part in that. In your case, one talent guy, you're invested with 60 pounds of precious metal should be good enough to get something done. But one talent guy just simply couldn't understand the job. Yeah, I don't get it. I don't know what we're trying to do. He mistook the job for self preservation or trying to pass some quizzical test that he was being subjected to. And maybe he somehow imagined that the answer would be that the master would want it buried at whatever the guy was going for. He clearly just was not on board with the agenda of the master and thus the master is rightly irritated. And of course, big picture. This parable is coming on the heels of Matthew 24. It's in the Olivet Discourse and it seems to be a follow up on Jesus big thesis statement of all of this with your big instruction in all of this, which is verse 42 of Matthew 24. Therefore, keep watch because you don't know on what day your Lord will come. And that raises this question. Like, why do we then get three parables about that? Wouldn't it be enough to just be like, Hey, therefore, keep watch because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But instead of that, we get one about a master and then a goofa servant and a gallant servant one who does right and does wrong. And then we get a more elaborate parable about 10 virgins or 10 bridesmaids. And then we get an even more elaborate parable about the talents that we're looking at now. Why are we getting three parables? Well, I think the answer is just discoverable when we look at what the specific angle is that's taken in each one. The first one is a question of very basic orientation. The goofa servant screws around. He's like, yeah, there's a delay. The master is gone. I don't know. Maybe that delay means he's never coming back. Whatever. This is untended property. I'm just going to be an idiot. But the gallant servant is like, I think he's coming back. He's got a lot of stuff here. He's been pretty reliable in the past. We should conduct ourselves in such a way that is in keeping with the assumption that he will definitely be back. And well, when he gets back, the goofa servant looks like an idiot. The gallant servant looks right. So at the most basic level, I suppose the instruction of the first parable would be like, now this might look untended, but it is tended and the master is going to return proceed accordingly. But then with the 10 virgins, you've got another wrinkle that's added in because these 10 virgins have to account for two different things that theoretically are in tension. They're sitting outside the household where the official wedding ceremony is happening. Their job is literally to wait until that part of the ceremony is over and then to lead a processional through the night, which means that they have to conduct themselves in a way that indicates that they are ready at any given moment for whatever legal going zones inside or whenever they're going to be over, we're going to be right here. We're waiting. We're ready the whole time. It's imminent. It could be any moment, but also they got a plan for a very long haul because even though it could be any moment, it could be a very, very long time. It could be deep into the night and so bringing reserves of oil is the right orientation. They're oriented in such a way that they know that it could be any minute, but they're ready for the very, very long haul, if need be. And the parable of the talents takes yet another angle and it deals more specifically with just getting it, just getting the exercise here. It's not enough to just be like, we will wait. And also in the back of our mind, we know that that waiting could be over at any time. No, there's something that you do in the interim. And what you do during the delay is that you take those resources, give it to you by the master and you use it to advance what the master is up to. And to do that, you have to understand the character of the master. So while he's away, you can anticipate what kind of things he would want you to do and which direction he would want you to push the rock. And then when he shows up, you get the awesomest thing that you could possibly hear from the master, which is well done, good and faithful servant. The master in this parable is not some kind of jerk who exploits and uses the people who work for him. They do awesome work. And then they come in and they share in his happiness. They share. Well, we know from the larger context of Matthew and the ownership of all of this stuff even. And then you get that one little line at the end about take the one away from the one guy who buried it and give it to the guy with 10. That a little bit flies in the face of our notions of fairness today. But I think it's pretty easy to understand what he's driving out there. If we just interpret it in terms of the larger context of the book of Matthew and the fact that this is all a bit of a dialogue with first century Judaism and with the history of the prophets and the forefathers of the prophets and the mess that Jesus accuses them of having made the idea that your house will be left bare, the idea that the system is coming down. All of that is so present in the last three or four chapters. And it would seem that this last little line is in keeping with that. You were given this responsibility for the kingdom of your supposed God, your supposed master, but you didn't do it. You buried it. This seems to fit with Jesus rebuke toward the religious leaders, both in Luke and just a little bit earlier in Matthew, that'd be 23. Where he's saying like, you're supposed to open the door and like connect people with God and instead you wouldn't hit the keys so that they don't have access to God and you're supposed to lift these burdens. And instead you're heaping them with heavy burdens. The idea then being that the religious establishment had pooped the bed and whatever vestedness they had been given. It wasn't like that was just going to be wasted or squandered. No, it's not going to be wasted. It's instead going to be reallocated to something that has confidently demonstrated its ability to provide a kingdom return for the master's household. So at the most basic level, it would seem that the parable of the talents is in there because it's meant to serve as a cautionary tale as an exhortation to the kingdom citizen to say, Hey, look, this is what it is to be properly oriented. This is what it is to get the exercise here to understand your role, to understand what you're doing and to help you avoid the mistake of that dude who I saw not get his job and thus not be able to proactively play the role that he was supposed to play because he just I mean, he just wasn't oriented properly. And so though this does take much more of a cautionary tale angle and tone than some of the earlier parables throughout the book of Matthew, it's still a very useful cautionary tone because well, if somebody thinks there's a God and they think the kingdom thing makes sense and they want to sign up and this is what they want to use their life on, like you would want to get the principal, you would want to get the idea so that you could feel like you were pulling the rock in the right direction and properly oriented and making the most of what you've decided to invest your life in. This is a very helpful, orienting passage for somebody who's been in for a long time in terms of the whole kingdom Christian thing. And just trying to remember exactly what the point is like, what do I do? What's my role here is is also a very helpful parable on the front end for somebody who's size ended up and is just trying to understand what the deal is. What does it mean to be a Christian or to be a part of the kingdom? So I dig this one and there's a few more implications to it that I want to process with you. I think tomorrow will be our last day on the parable of the talents and then we will roll forward. Glad we all get to hang out and do this together. I'm Matt.
