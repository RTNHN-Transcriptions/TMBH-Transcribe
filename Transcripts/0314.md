 From time to time, I tell you about these kids that I have. I've got the three of them. I've got a boy and a couple little girls and I, I'm just crazy about them. I don't know how that happened when Camilla first told me that we were going to have a baby. I was like, that is awesome, but I didn't totally know why. And then it's just hard to picture loving a human that doesn't exist yet and you can't see yet. And then they came along and each one as they came into the world, it was incredible. I just immediately loved everything about them. And I still do. I got this problem. I don't even know why I'm telling you this right now, but I pull up my old hard drives to work on stuff like this. And I also have old photos, years of photos on there. And if I fall into the trap of opening those things up, I look at them and I just get misty eyed, cry and stuff. I mean, these kids are still with me. They're in my house. I love them. Everything's going great. We're still doing family stuff. They're young, but I feel this weird sense of joy and nostalgia and grief over the passing of the time that we've already had together. And I just have, I have an incredibly soft heart for them. I guess it's part of the squishy heart dad thing, but I've got a particular soft spot for their brains. I want them to be great at thinking. I want them to be great as you and I have talked about before and understanding a story and understanding character arcs. I want them to be great at interpreting cultural texts. Some of the people I look up to the very most, this is the obscure talent that they have that I admire and then it makes them wise. It makes them decisive in the moment. It makes them compassionate and merciful. It's orienting for them, not just with the stories they read in books and scottun TV and movies and stuff, but it helps them to be really good at the Bible. And so I want my kids to have this skill set. So we're doing this thing where I'd say every night, but it's not every night. Before we go and read in bed and stuff, we do the whole family thing and we kind of sit down. And right now we're working on the book of Mark together. We're like doing what you and I are doing together right now with Matthew, but we're doing the book of Mark. And I'm pushing them real hard and they're doing great. And I'm trying to do this thing where I have graciously very high expectations for their ability to think and comprehend. And so we start light, we tackle really challenging stuff and then we come back out to pretty light stuff at the end and constantly asking them, did you understand all this stuff? Did you track with me? Do you get it? Repeat it back to me. Do you have any questions or you follow in? What do you make of this? What's your read on it? It's hyper important to me that this not be an exercise in me shouting religious words about Bible things at my kids' ear holes and hoping that somehow some of it sticks. I think it's a recipe for making them resent it. I want it to feel engaging and fun. I want them to look back on this someday and be like, those are some of the conversations where I really learned how to think and decide for myself what I was going to do with this whole faith thing. So it's very important to me that they be able to say, yeah, I understand and repeat some of that stuff back. Well, likewise, you get to the end of the Kingdom parables discourse in Matthew chapter 13, which is put together by a far better teacher than I am. But hey, I'm taking one cue from him. He gets to the end and he's also like, all right, did you all get all of that? Now, this might seem like just a normal thing that you do when you're trying to teach something to make sure that you check in with everybody to make sure it worked. There's a lot more that you need to cover, but there's something pretty cool narratively going on with Jesus ending this discourse in this way because we see this arc on the part of the disciples going from not really getting it right on up to okay. They're affirming that they do get it. So here's how the Kingdom parable discourse rounds out in Matthew 13 starting in verse 51. This comes right on the heels of the parable of the net that we've been spending the last few days on. Here's our goes. Have you understood all these things Jesus asked? Yes, they replied. He said to them, therefore, every teacher of the law who's been instructed about the Kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old the end. That's it. There's no more Kingdom parables discourse. I'm looking for it. That's how the whole thing wraps up. So I guess it's appropriate that he wraps up a discourse that is peppered throughout with a sides and references to the Old Testament and questions that acknowledge the fact that some people are going to get the parables and some people aren't going to get the parables. Some people as they're being told or getting it and some people as they're being told are not getting it. I mean, if you wanted to round out this discourse, this chunk of Bible in a way that was indicative of what we just did for the last 52 verses, you would need to finalize or reiterate that point about understanding or lack thereof. You'd probably want to end with a parable, which he does. So we get our fifth micro parable here and we'll break that down a little bit more here in just a second. But first back to the theme of understanding. I always flip back through this thing. It's pretty interesting. So it starts out with that same day. Jesus went out of the house as a beginning of Matthew 13 and sat by the lake such large crowds gathered around him that he had to get into a boat and sit in while the people were there on shore and he told him a bunch of things and parables saying and then he goes into the parable of the sower and let's just step back for a minute and do the big picture narrative look at what happens here because I don't think we've ever done that. So he goes out by the lake is near Capernaum. You're going to have a bunch of Galileans hanging around. You're still going to have the temple presence with the scribes and teachers of the law who are coming out from the synagogue that's there at Capernaum, the ruins of which are still present. Maybe you have a few Romans kind of sneaking in in the back to, you know, we're just making sure there's no sedition here. But really, we get the impression that there's some people who are interested. Jesus has already had a positive effect on some of the Roman occupiers and you're going to have your merchants and your normal people who are just, you know, taking a break to see what the next awesome thing they're going to get from this Jesus guy is about. And then you've got this inner circle who are there with him as well. It's a lot of people. This is a big event. This is not normal. I'm sure that the teachers of the law at the synagogue didn't draw this kind of crowd every day. Jesus is becoming a phenomenon and there's a little spice to it too. I mean, there's some tension and drama. Like, what's he going to say? What are the religious leaders going to say? So people gather around. There's so many there. They can't be heard. Jesus harnesses his understanding of the natural world and the rules that make it go because he invented all of that stuff. He gets out on the boat. He uses that refraction principle to make his voice well heard. And apparently, you know, the speech is broken up into little pieces. So he gives the parable of the sower, which is a fascinating place to start because it's kind of a microcosm for the whole thing. It's about somebody spreading the seed of truth of the kingdom just everywhere indiscriminately. Well, that's exactly what he's doing as he gives the kingdom parable discourse. I mean, he's distributing this truth to a whole wide variety of people right there. They probably don't understand that that parable is describing what is happening in the moment as he's saying it, but it better to occur to a lot of people later. So then apparently we have a little breather, a little sidebar. I don't know if the disciples are out there in the same boat. They've got a couple of bonus boats out there. Or if Jesus comes in for a breather, I don't know, whatever the case. But in verse 10, the disciples, you know, they come up to them like, Hey, why do you speak to the people in parables? Jesus is like, Hey, guys, the knowledge of the kingdom has been given to you, but not to them, presumably not to all of them. And then Jesus himself says that he is fulfilling what was written in the prophet Isaiah about God opening and closing eyes. And he's like, Hey, you know, like the biggest thing that you guys need to take from this is blessed are your eyes and your ears, because they have been opened by God for you to see and hear. And it's not just that Jesus is talking about, you know, see and hear like religious stuff, but to see and hear these parables, he's saying you do or you will understand what these parables are about. And then it's a little bit ambiguous in verse 18 when he finishes this aside with the disciples. And he says, listen then to what the parable of the so were means. When he when here's the message about the kingdom, he explains the whole thing. Is he answering the disciples question? Hey, why do you speak in parables to the whole group? Hey, I just got asked a good question here, guys, if I could everybody kind of come back in, I got asked why I speak in parable. So here's why I do that, because the knowledge of the kingdom has been given to you and then he gestures it as disciples, but maybe not to you. And he gestures to some of the people who are there listening. I guess it could be like that, or it could be that this is all a big sidebar. If it's all a big sidebar, then the explanation of the parable of the so are only goes to the disciples and it doesn't go to the whole natural amphitheater. It's worth of crowd here. So then in verse 24, it says Jesus told them another parable. Well, who is them? I think the best way to read this, given the context is that Jesus must be giving this next parable. This is the one about the wheat and the weeds to the whole group that are gathered together, because it's only later that privately the inner circle asks to have that one explained. They would have asked immediately if that had been part of the sidebar out in the boat, but it doesn't appear to have been so. So probably everybody hears the parable of the sower. Maybe everybody hears the explanation of that parable. Probably everybody hears the parable of the wheat and the weeds. And then in verse 31, he told them another parable. There's no indication that we're on another sidebar. So the micro parables of the mustard seed and the yeast probably go to everyone once again. And then in verse 34, it's like Jesus spoke all these things and parables. And once again, it deals with this question of open eyes, closed eyes, open ears, shut ears. And then he left the crowd and went into the house. So the audience doesn't tap out. They're not bored. They're not annoyed. They're like, Oh, that's plenty of parables for today. Good golly. No, they probably wanted more, but Jesus puts his boat into short and he just wanders off. He's like, no, I'm out. And they get inside the house back in Capernaum, which is probably a little bit of a walk. Maybe the crowd is trying to follow him and get more out of him. But that's all that we have recorded. And Jesus and the disciples get to the house in Capernaum. Peter's house probably they shut the door and the disciples are like, Oh, you got to tell us what that wheat and the weeds thing meant. And Jesus immediately answers, well, it's like this and it's like this and it's like this. And then he rolls right into another parable that is again private. He tells them the micro parable of the hidden treasure. The micro parable of the pearl of great price. Then he tells them the almost repetitive parable of the net that seems to match with the parable of the wheat and the weeds. And then we get done with that. It ends with another warning about judgment. And then we're into what we talked about today. Have you understood all these things? Jesus asked. Now, the answer that we're going to get to Jesus question here, I think, is much more satisfying after just carefully going back through the whole narrative overview of this discourse. They just say, yep. Yeah, cool. If they're lying, Jesus knows we already see that such a theory, he knows what's going on in people's hearts and what they're thinking. And he seems absolutely satisfied that their answer is truthful. Hey, they get it. Their eyes have been opened. Their ears have been opened. And then he concludes with this little micro parable that we are going to have to tackle tomorrow. Parting note, I have decided to initiate a contest that all of you are going to be invited to participate in. And it has a prize. I'm not totally decided what the prize is going to be yet, but I'm not going to tell you about it this time because we're tight on time. So just mental note, put a pin in it. There's going to be a thing and it's going to be great. And I'll tell you all about it later. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. You
