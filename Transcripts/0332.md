 One of the things I've really enjoyed about the internet and YouTube in particular are the videos and the commentary that you get on storytelling. I love storytelling. I love narrative. I love especially complex storytelling that has lots of layers and themes and stuff to take out of it, stuff that challenges you and pushes you. That's the mark of good art. Bad art reaffirms whatever you were feeling a second ago and makes you feel like you're feeling like you don't need to change or grow or be challenged in any way. Good art has a bit more of a provocative factor that pushes you toward some kind of change or clarification of why you think what you think. Maybe that's part of why I'm not that offended by art and I understand that other people view art differently and maybe are a bit more offended by art that pushes a boundary here or there. Whatever the case, I like the way the internet pushes back on art. In some ways it's been disappointing because when the artists, the people who make the movies and write the books and do the music and whatnot, hear this pushback and then they clearly try to gerrymander their plots and their stories and their work around what the internet wants. You get Star Wars Episode 8. It's a dumpster fire. But when artists art and critics criticize, you get a pretty good balance in terms of how everything works. Again, what's been pretty fun about the internet is what's an easier model for content than watching what other people make and then responding to it. That's a pretty smooth sailing model where you've always got the next bit of obvious content right out in front of you. So, you know, the Mandalorian comes out. Now we've got WandaVision that is the new Friday night thing on Disney Plus and everybody's watching it and these shows are deep with Easter eggs and nuggets and little hints here and there and fanservice in reference to this comic or that other movie. And I really enjoy watching those shows and then flipping right around and watching the breakdowns, the Easter eggs. This is what this means. This is what that means. And when all the dust is settled and those quick turnaround little videos are done being made and we're into the more taken the season and reflect on what happened here kind of mode, I like to watch the deep dive narrative storytelling film critic reviews of all of the shows I watch, both the ones that I really like, like WandaVision and the Mandalorian and the ones that I thought were complete and utter dumpster fires like Wonder Woman 1984. Either way, I like hearing people put their brains to breaking down. What really happened there? What worked? What didn't? What are the nuts and bolts of this thing and how did it work? And whether you're into reviews and breakdowns like that or not, I think we'd all have to admit that it's pretty natural when we're poking at some dumb superhero movie, but it's a little trickier to know exactly what the dance steps are when you get to a part of the Bible that you're not exactly sure how to explain. The nuts and bolts are trickier to figure out. So we get certain miraculous accounts in the New Testament where there is a very obvious and measurable result and where in your brain you can picture it and you're like, oh, well, if they did a breakdown review of this particular miracle, and be like, well, I probably went like this because people were standing there and the guy couldn't walk and Jesus says walk, either he's going to be able to for the first time in his life or he's not. Let's see what happens. Oh, you got to be walked. I guess that one worked out. That was a real miracle. What happened there physically and that guy's legs is nervous system. Did stuff knit back together? Underneath his skin and places that people couldn't see and all of a sudden something that was physically broken now. I have no idea. I have no idea how that happened, but I'm comfortable saying there were a lot of witnesses there and this is what they saw and it worked. But then there are other miracles that are more head scratching and these miracles bring out a lot more of the metaphorical YouTube breakdown video types to direct their attention that the nuts and bolts of what actually went down in these miracles. And perhaps there's no miracle that more raises these kinds of, hey, what actually happened there kinds of questions in the gospels than the feeding of the 5000. Now there are four accounts of the feeding of the 5000 and two accounts of an additional feeding of another 4000. So you've got the only miracle that occurs in all the gospels and you also have two parallel miracles that go along with it that follow the exact same recipe. And if you really think about what it would be like to be in the crowd and be sitting there, it's understandable that this miracle would raise questions for people of any age in any era thinking about what the deal was here. I'm going to read it to you again. Matthew chapter 14, Jesus is sad because John died and he gets into a boat and he goes away and he lands and there's a big crowd there and instead of being all mad, it says when Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and he healed their sick. His evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, this is a remote place and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to villages and buy themselves some food. Jesus replied, they don't need to go away. You give them some to eat. We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish. They answered and bring them here to me. He said and he directed the people to sit down on the grass and then taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people and they all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up 12 basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was about 5,000 men besides women and children. So the text allows for the fact that this is a lot more than 5,000 people. I want to think through the physics of what actually happened here and see if there's any way to make sense of it. So let's say you were sitting in the crowd and you brought nothing on this trip. Maybe his teaching was so compelling that they were like, I just can't leave. When you super have to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of a movie, be like, if I go pee, I'm going to miss a thing that I really need to see. I'm just going to have to sit here and you're probably doing long term damage to your excretory system. But it's worth it because it's a really good story. I mean, maybe they got going early in the day and they brought food along for lunch and they ate lunch, but Jesus just kept healing people and kept saying things that were important and they're like, I can't go anywhere. I'm super hungry, but I can't miss any of this. This is a big deal. I mean, if they were compelled enough to follow them on an aimless, a directional hike with no known concluding point, they were probably compelled enough to sit there and be hungry. But either way, it gets to be evening. That's what the text says. And you're sitting there in this crowd. You're sitting there, you're hearing the truth about the kingdom, one who teaches with authority, not like everybody else who ever hear teach. And your stomach's rallying, but you just can't move on. Then there's a little hubbub up there. The disciples kind of huddle up with Jesus and you're like, oh, what are we doing here? And then, oh, okay, I recognize this. This is the prayer time for a meal. It doesn't look like they have that much food, but okay, we'll see where it goes. I don't know if it was just quiet during this time. So disciples went around. They didn't feel like church when communion gets distributed. There's somebody playing an organ. Was everybody just kind of muttering and mumbling and it was sort of an interlude? No, I have no idea. But whatever the case of food goes around, you're sitting there and you're like, well, I mean, it's not going to make it to me. I saw how much I was. And then it gets to you. And then there's plenty. And after that, you're probably doing the math on it and you're like, well, I didn't see where I was watching the whole time. I didn't see where that came from. So let me watch behind me now. Is there more food now than there was before? How is this happening? And your brain, based on the way the miracle is described, maybe like, is this slide of hand? There's some secret store houses of food here or there that they're bringing out as they go along. Am I just confused on what I'm witnessing here in terms of distribution or would it be a thing where you're sitting there and you're like, all right, I had my eye on you the whole time. I see what you guys did. I have no idea where that food came from. You handed the basket down the line. I watched it get handed down the line and people took stuff out, but there was more in it at the end. So this is a very strange miracle to try to mentally break down, not just for me, not just for people through the ages, but also surely for the people who were right there. Somebody had to have noticed what was going on and have wondered how the thing worked. Well, in the end, everybody asked to agree that the disciples were right there. They didn't really have any bonus food or anything. They just had that little bit. And now we got all these baskets full and that's pretty weird. Where did it come from? So people wrestle with this through the ages. I think the majority position has been, well, there was a miracle. There was more bread and there was more fish at the end that there was at the beginning. If God can call existence out of non-existence and if everything that has been made has been made through Christ, then surely if he wanted to illustrate a point about his compassion toward the people and he wanted to illustrate a further theological point about his provision that goes along with that compassion and how the disciples are the ambassadors now of that compassion and that provision, if he wanted to make that theological point, I mean, I have a tough time thinking of a better miracle to illustrate that point. This is great. And so I think the main position throughout history would be, yeah, it's exactly what it says. It's in all four gospels. It's all over the place. There was just a little bit of food and then there got to be a lot more food along the way. There are other positions that have become more popular in the last 150, 200 years. And I suppose one of these should be called the sacramental position. You get this vague description that never really says here's exactly how these things multiplied or what the people saw as it was happening. And really, this is just symbolic of communion. It's symbolic of a sacrament and they each got maybe just a little bit of food. They broke it up into teeny tiny little pieces. I don't know how that accounts for the 12 baskets. It doesn't make a ton of sense to me, but it's not a crazy stretch for people from this camp to say it seems like there's something kind of last suppery about this. And indeed, all of the verbs that are used here are also used in the accounts of the last supper. He took bread, he broke it, he gave thanks, all of that language is very familiar. I mean, what does the last supper symbolize? It symbolizes the body and blood of Christ. At the same time here, we don't get the blood part. I mean, it's bread and it's fish, so it's food and it's food. So at the very least, we have to acknowledge that it's a pretty different analogy that's being employed here. A third position, and I'm sure a lot of people have thrown this one out, but it's the take, if I recall correctly, that everybody was being selfish with whatever provisions they still had with them on this big journey for the day. And then Jesus and the disciples were not selfish and then everybody else was not selfish. And so everybody shared with everybody else. And in the end, the sharing resulted in like, everybody having like way more than they ever needed and be like, oh, wow, if we work together, there's a lot more here than otherwise. The weakness of that position is that it doesn't square very neatly with the accounts in the four gospels or the two bonus accounts of the feeding of the four thousand. It just doesn't look like that's what happened in the text could have said that's what happened if it wanted to. I'll turn over my cards. I tend to think that upon a close examination, it looks like the gospel authors are holding out the miraculous events of the life of Jesus as having actually happened miraculously and trying to communicate to the reader that this is an indication of God's blessing and his affirmation on the work of Jesus and that it being actually miraculous is important to the larger claims of Jesus as well. So do I wrestle with some of these miracles and how they physically worked? You dang well better believe it. But at the same time, the exercise you and I have agreed to go through here is trying to understand what the author is trying to communicate. And so whether ultimately at the level of the soul, each and every one of us agrees on exactly what the nuts and bolts of this miracle was, I think we can agree that it looks like Matthew is holding it out as having literally and miraculously happened. And at least for me, that framing on behalf of Matthew leaves me wanting a whole bunch of good YouTube video breakdowns and Easter egg hunts for how exactly that went down and what to make of it. Again, regardless of what you do with the details there, what is abundantly clear is that this is the fulfillment of foreshadowing from earlier in the book that demonstrates Jesus an ending compassion for the crowds and not just that he's nice and he cares about them, but that he has the ability to do something about their situation. That is a crucial theme of the book of Matthew. In Jesus, we get the God who is close enough to care about the human condition, but also powerful enough and different enough to do something about the human condition. And with that, we'll pause for the day. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
