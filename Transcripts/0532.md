 The A my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we are working on the following verses right now Matthew 23 starting in verse 16. This is Jesus talking critically toward the Pharisees and the teachers of the law in the temple complex in front of everybody shortly before he gets crucified. What do you blind guides? You say if anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath and then he goes on and you blind fools, which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred. And then the next verses are going to follow the same pattern. But there's where I want to start with this conversation today. I have known a lot of people in my life who I would say are pretty honest folks. Pretty honest. I don't know. You got to leave some flexibility there, right? But every now and then I've run into people who are ludicrously honest. They go almost dangerously honest. They view integrity as something that is proactive and that can even go so far as to me and like, no, no, if I think it, I'm going to say it, which can be incredibly hurtful. Sometimes I don't need to know the thing that you were thinking at a given time. But I've also met this small group of people who seem to have put a ton of thought into what honest means. They seem to have a really developed ethic of all the different levels of truth telling. I mean, everybody would say like, oh, it's important to tell the truth, right? But what does it mean to tell the truth or to not lie? Really? I mean, there are a lot of categories. One would be if you say you're going to do something, you probably better do the thing. I have one friend in particular who even if casually he says, oh, yeah, I'll do that thing. We'll do that by that time. It means he's going to do it. That's it. And even if the other person is pretty much forgotten or viewed it as just this passing who cares. I mean, this particular friend will go back to them to seek their blessing to go and do something else or to change plans. Otherwise, I just got to do it. I said I would do it. That's that. Whereas most of us that I'm going to do it is a little more open ended, a little more flexible. Like I'm going to do it. If God willing and the creek don't rise, like I'm going to get I'm getting there. I'm going to get to it. It's kind of like the corporate motto of spirit airlines, which is I think we'll get to it settle down. We'll get to it. But then you got another category of truth telling that would be something like a promise about what you're not going to do or how you're going to conduct yourself in a thing. Like, I'm just not going there. I'm not doing that. And then maybe even the circumstances change a little bit. You're like, wow, not makes more sense now for me to go and do that thing. I said I wasn't going to do, but I said I wasn't going to do it. And I'm kind of bound by that. Now, most people would say, and circumstances change, but some people are like, nope, that's a matter of personal integrity. I made a statement. My word is very important. I don't want to compromise it even a little bit. I said I wasn't going to do the thing. I'm not going to do the thing. And then you got the level of lying and truth telling that I suppose is just accurate accounting is just saying the thing went down a certain way. And it's an accurate description of how the thing actually went down and where you're not actually sure you offer the caveats. You're like, I don't know. Like I'm kind of biased here or I had a weird angle. I didn't really have a good look at the play. It would be difficult for me to say with certainty exactly how that worked out. Can I get some help here? And I suppose if somebody's really into truth telling on something like that, then even if the thing that unfolded in the details of the circumstances as they actually occurred are damning to them or hurtful to them, eh, truth is truth. They still got to say how the thing is. I don't want to compromise my integrity. And I super respect people like that. And I super know what it's like to be very, very tempted not to be a person like that because sometimes it really stinks when you're the lone witness to a thing that went down and what you witnessed isn't necessarily beneficial to you, but you're called upon to speak to it one way or the other. That's a difficult moral dilemma. I get it. And then I suppose you have another level of truth telling which is emotional truth, sole level truth. This is the one that gets a little bit tricky when you get into like the pearls before swine business from Matthew chapter seven, the sermon on the mount that we looked at a while back. We're like, how much am I obligated to just say exactly what I'm thinking about myself, about a relationship, about how the things are in the world is some degree of decorum or restraint still honest. And again, I think that's the sort of thing that some people have a very developed ethic of. Other people would have a more simplistic ethic that would say, no, on that stuff, it's opinion. I could change it anytime. You have plausible deniability. Say whatever you need to say in the moment, it'll be fine. Other people would say, nope, no matter what I am thinking about a thing, honesty means I just stand up boldly and I proclaim the thing at the clouds if I have to. But I always say the thing as I see the thing. And even though on the surface, that sounds probably really down home country and take ready. Yes, or no, sir. There's also a downside to that and that it's very easy to paint yourself into corners as more thought, more reflection, more information gets added to the equation. You might think something differently, but then you might be in a place where you're like, no, changing your opinion is a sign of not integrity. So my point in all of this is to say we're in the middle of a passage in Matthew chapter 23, where we are talking about slippery oath taking. We're talking about weaseling with truth and Jesus accusation against the religious leaders of the time. We call in blind guides. His accusation is these guys are truth weasels and you should note that by their behavior and by all of the weasel words that they use and integrity and leadership are not things you should ascribe to them because they are the blind leading the blind and it's made evident by the fact that they don't handle basic matters of truth and falsehood, promises and keeping promises with any kind of integrity. So the reason I open this conversation the way I do is to say, look, I'm not encouraging and I don't think the Bible even necessarily encourages an overly simplistic view of truth and debate and ideas and accounting. I generally speaking, I think this is all safe to say what the Bible teaches for people who would be adherence to the religion associated with the God purported to be behind this Bible would be number one. Finally speaking, you're supposed to tell people the truth about a thing that happened when asked. You're supposed to give an accurate accounting of stuff and not deceive people. This text also at several points indicates that like if you say you're going to do something, you're probably supposed to do it unless there's some really good reason otherwise and then you would kind of need to be released from that by the people you made certain vows to you, maybe even vows to God. The text certainly indicates that you don't want to be flippant or sloppy with that kind of thing, but decisive and careful with vows. I mean, the glowing example of being not careful with your vows is back in the first third of judges. I never remember where eight, nine, 10, somewhere in there. There's the story of Jeptha. I'm looking now because I don't want to get that wrong of the guy who won a battle and made this rash vow about, oh, whoever comes out to greet me or whatever comes out to greet me from my house, I will sacrifice that to the Lord and God didn't ask him to do it. That is in 11. Well, okay, I was close. And it turns out to be his kid who comes out and the text certainly doesn't give the impression that it was like, and God was super happy that he made that vow and then God was super happy that he kept it, but it looks like the guy does keep it and it's just a bizarre anecdote. I think it's supposed to read as a cautionary tale about making stupid sloppy dumb vows. And maybe it's supposed to read as a cautionary tale about keeping stupid sloppy dumb vows. All of this to say the Bible characterizes the enemy, the devil, the tempter Satan, the one who tried to mess up the whole redemptive plan. The enemy is likened to a roaring lion, one that is the father of lies, a deceiver, one that tries to confuse and muddy the waters and the minds of people and the world with accusations and guilt and out and out want and lies. And God is the God of the light and the truth. So the bad stuff is darkness, deception, the stuff you can only get away with in the dark where things are murky. The good stuff, that's the God of the light and stuff goes into the light and you can see it better and it makes sense. And all of that general principle comes up in John chapter one as well. So as we unpack the rest of this passage in Matthew chapter 23, narratively, it's pretty straightforward. It looks like there were a bunch of slippery practices with the truth and Jesus is calling out the leaders who participate in benefit from and even advocate for those slippery practices. But the, what do you do with this for yourself question that doesn't obviously come up in most passages in the Bible, but kind of is coming up in this passage. Yeah, I think it's challenging. And I also don't think this passage alone gives us our Bible take on what truth is. I think you got a whole bunch of stuff all over the place that gives you a little bit more clarity on that. And I think the expectation of this passage is that anybody who reads it, whether they're sympathetic to the Pharisee side or not is supposed to look at it and be like, well, being consistent is better than being a hypocrite telling the truth is far better than lying, saying what you mean and having the most obvious interpretation of the words you said publicly be reflective of the truth and your intentions. That's a good thing saying things that are meant to be shady and sneaky and cleverly worded so you can get away with doing things that are technically kind of what I said, but that are clearly reflective of a lying heart and manipulative dishonest motivations. Like, clearly the prior is better than the latter. All of those things come through in this text, but it seemed important to me before we got any further into this thing that we should just acknowledge that truth and falsehood has a whole bunch of different categories to it. And at one point or another around the Bible, all of those different categories are spoken to, but they all come down to this bottom line reality. The Bible holds out things that are true and accurate and trustworthy as being reflective of the values of the kingdom, reflective of the values of God and things that are dishonest, even if technically legal or somehow covered with very cleverly framed paperwork or phrasing or fingers crossed behind the back that no matter how technically legal those things might be, they are reflective of the father of lies and the opposite of kingdom values stuff. Or to take it a step further, such behavior indicates that the person who's doing it and advocating for it believes that ultimately they will answer for things in this world in the court of public opinion where they might be able to get away with lying on some sort of technicality and correspondingly such a character then doesn't care very much about the judgment of an all knowing deity who sees the weaseling and manipulation and dishonesty they were employing and probably wouldn't care at all about the paperwork that they did to make it look technically legal. What's indicated here is that these blind guides, these religious frauds, that wouldn't bother them at all because maybe what's at the core of this accusation is they don't actually think there's a God or if they do think there's a God they profoundly misunderstand him and are far more concerned with the opinions of people, the judgments of people than they are with the opinions or judgments of God. What I intended to be like the first four minutes of this episode turned out to be the entire episode, but hey, that happens from time to time. That's part of the beauty of the format is we can do this all day long. And as you have observed at this point, oh, we will. So we'll just keep chipping away at Matthew 23 verses 18 through 22 next time around. A map is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
