 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and thanks for hanging out with me. I know you got lots of things to do and there are bajillion podcasts now. There were only like a gajillion when I started but now they're a bajillion, jillion because everybody started a podcast and lots of them are really good. And so it's just a lot of things for you to spend your time on and there's a lot of things that you got to do in life and yet here you are. So I just never want it to be lost on you or for you to think that it's lost on me how cool it is that you make the time and that we get to do this. I really genuinely appreciate it. Also I appreciate how patient you are with me talking about things that have nothing to do with the Bible seemingly at first but then surprise I ninja you into the thing actually having to do something with the Bible and this time around the thing I'm going to talk about that seems like it doesn't have anything to do with the Bible but it actually does is the Incredibles 2. Did you see this one? I really like the first one. My favorite animated movie ever maybe my favorite movie ever it's right up there I really love the show. Incredibles 2 was just fine as well but maybe not quite at that elite level but one of the things that I really did like about Incredibles 2 was how they wrestled with the concept of how people would actually respond to actual superheroes. And I saw that get wrestled with in Captain America Civil War. Oh these superheroes are too powerful we need to get them under control with the government and I saw how that got wrestled with in the watchmen. These superheroes they're so much better than everybody else they just don't care they become detached but I really liked most of all the way it was handled in Incredibles 2 which was we just need to ban this. It's dangerous and it's other and we need to pass legislation decisively that prohibits superheroism that's just too much power and that makes for an interesting movie but it also makes for an interesting parallel when we get into Matthew 8 because if you can understand the psychology even in a hypothetical world that would cause people to say it's just too much power. It has to be limited it has to be controlled it has to be shut down then you can understand the not hypothetical psychology of a bunch of people who see this incredible outlay of power that we're getting from Jesus power over distance, disease, physics, time, the weather, spiritual forces of evil, social forces that seem immovable, all of the things that people can't change. They see this exercise of power and they're like yeah yep I'm going to take my chances with the mundane things that's just too much it's beyond control it's beyond understanding it's intimidating it's weird and I just want that to go somewhere else and I for one think that when we get into Matthew 8 and Jesus has just crossed the Sea of Galilee with his disciples he called him to the storm they ask the question who is this guy who can do that and they get to the other side near this region of the Gatorines and there's these two demoniacs who come out they're crazy and they're powerful and they run right up to Jesus and confront him and then they're so intimidated by him that they start nervously negotiating against themselves and finally they're like just don't torture us just put us in those pigs and Jesus says go and that's his only word that he speaks to them and they go and they run into all of these pigs and then the demons make them crash over the edge of the sea and the Sea of Galilee and they drown and they die and if all of that sounds crazy that's okay we're just going to roll with it even though it is very difficult for us to picture with our 21st century minds and then we get to a place where the people who have not heard about or seen all the things that Jesus have necessarily been doing maybe just vague rumors they see it firsthand or get word of it very close to firsthand then what are they going to do are they going to be like wow we want superheroes over here we want that kind of power we want that kind of stuff that we can't control that isn't even really from our version of religion that'd be awesome or are they going to behave more like the citizens of whatever the town is capital city or whatever it is in the Incredibles and be like no that's too much that freaks us out you're just going to need to go away and I'm going to give you a spoiler right now it's the second one they say you need to go away so here's what happens he said to them we're just going to pick it up in verse 32 with Jesus saying one word to the demons he said to them go so they came out and went into the pigs and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water those tending the pigs ran off went into the town and reported all of this including what happened to the demon possessed men then the whole town went out to meet Jesus and when they saw him they pleaded with him to leave their region this is all so calm and I think part of what we're experiencing here is the limitation of the length of a scroll in the first century AD which is the medium on which this stuff would have been written I mean at some point you just got to cut details and be like all right what's the theological thrust of this moment what do people need to know what do people need to see here and we're going to condense this down into something tight because I got a ton of questions I want to know what happened to the demon possessed guys we talked about that last time around everywhere they better were they happy now did they miss the demons did they try to follow Jesus we have a corresponding account that gives us the impression that these are those guys and that that is what they did but we don't know for sure and also I want to know what are the people who are tending the pigs go and tell the people in town I mean how'd you say it did you say a dumb in a way that would make them not like Jesus because you should have said it's smart like you should have let me say it because that was awesome look at what happened and also I have a question like what were the people who have also been out of shape about we don't really get an answer to any of that stuff but what we do get is one of Matthew's many pump the breaks moments in his gospel every time it starts to seem like the Jesus thing is going to be this snowball rolling downhill it's going to become unstoppable everybody's going to sign up I mean he's fixing demon possessed people he's curing people the stuff that's going to kill him he's conquering nature I mean for crying out loud who wouldn't sign up every time it starts to feel like this is inevitable along comes an incident that proves to us that no it's not actually this is not automatic and humanity will find a way to reject its rightful king because I don't know it's hard and there's just a lot that gets in the way and there are a lot of concerns that we have maybe some of them are fair maybe some of them aren't very fair but people are frail and it's super obvious and easy for us when we're reading the text to imagine that everybody should just sign up but the reality of the world and our own experience in it says it's not actually usually so cut and dried so here's your pump the break moment they're out on Jesus they don't want anything to do with them why well I got theories theory number one is just economics do you know that pigs cost money now they're charging for them they'll just give them away like if you go to the pig store they're like no it's gonna be ten dollars I'm sorry we don't give away our pigs anymore and I did some research on this and it turns out that even if you do the most humble modest recycle your trash and your mulch and feed the pigs terribly raise pigs to six months on your own strategy you're still looking at like three to four hundred bucks on the absolute cheapest end to raise a pig in today's money over the course of the summer and if you try to raise a pig for a longer period of time to get it up to a bigger weight like 300 pounds like a crazy big pig you can get a lot more money for and that means you have to raise it in part over the winter that takes the cost up to like 800 to a thousand bucks even if you're doing it on the cheap now when we picture money back in the day and money now of course our brains are conditioned to think oh yeah you got to adjust for inflation and this is true but you also have to adjust for the poverty level of the two places you're looking at some poor couple that wants to try to raise their own pigs out in the woods in the United States of America are still crazy rich compared to these herdsmen living outside of the riches of Jewish territory on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee in the first century so why did they want Jesus to go away well it could be that he just ran a herd of fifty a hundred several hundred pigs that would have been the entire savings account of the entire community off a cliff to their death now Jesus didn't actually do it demons did it but this is one of those places where we have to admit Jesus could have prevented that but did not so theory number one for why these people wanted Jesus gone could just be that this was a very expensive proposition and they were afraid of what might get run into the sea next and they'd be completely belly up and broke before too long if Jesus keeps doing miraculous things there we can't afford your miracles please go away sir reason number two would be racism things were not great in terms of ethnic tension between Jewish people and not Jewish people and there are some pretty smart people I've read who theorize that the people on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee would have been part Jewish which created enormous ethnic tension we see a little bit later on in the narrative over in the gospel of Luke that Jesus approaches a Samaritan village and they send emissaries out in advance to be like ah yeah no we're gonna pass we don't really want anything to do with you and you remember the sons of thunder James and John and that incident are like oh we should burn them with fire Jesus you have fire right like some kind of fire thing that you can call them from heaven or fire that comes from your eye you should burn them totally and Jesus like we're not burning anybody you got to stop with the burning stuff so we see this kind of rejection happen more than once from people who were on the fringes ethnically of the people who you know culturally Jesus was speaking the language of so reason number one that maybe they rejected Jesus was the economics of the thing reason number two is maybe just the racial tension reason number three could just be messiah exhaustion it's almost exactly this moment in history that Josephus tells us that ponch's pilot dispatched some guys to go and put down a messiah thing that was happening in Samaritan territory which is in this neck of the woods and they decided that they were gonna go and climb a mountain and find some stuff that Moses that hidden up there none of this makes any sense I understand that and then the Roman troops the pilot dispatched ran into him and they were just supposed to like rough him up and push him into some dumpsters and break some of their stuff but instead they stabbed him with spears and stuff and then pilot got in trouble and the region got in trouble and it was a disaster for everybody like this might have been in the newspaper the very day this is going on and this wasn't by any means the only recent messianic claim that had come upon the years of the people of the north they've been here in this for ages and it always seemed to end badly maybe these guys just had messiah exhaustion and they're like just no like we've had enough of these it's always a bad thing for us just go away we don't want anything to do with messiahs or the fourth reason and this is the one that is maybe most interesting to me and you can tell that because it's how I set up the opening comparison for this whole thing but that is the power is scary like governmental power is scary military power is scary but the gravity and authority that jesus commanded here is other scary it was scary to his buddies who were in the boat and who he just saved from drowning in death surely it's going to be scary to these people who just don't really know what to do with a superhero let alone a jewish superhero let alone one who's making these messianic claims let alone one who just cost them a whole bunch of money in their eyes because their savings account ran off a cliff you know what I think I just talked myself into believing that all four of those reasons why might have factored into it but the bigger point as we put a bow on all of this is twofold one narratively this reminds us that right now jesus is talking with jewish people this is not going out to gentiles yet is it for them yeah it's been for them from the beginning remember we looked at the Abrahamic covenant this was always meant for everybody it was always going to go out to everybody but right now jesus seems to be focused on doing this local thing and going to his own people this is going to expand as we get further along into it so narratively this serves as kind of a bumper that bounces us right back in to jewish territory and jewish culture the second reason it matters is something that I think is going to be clarified as we get more toward chapter 13 and the kingdom parables about the nature of how people respond to the message of the kingdom and they're going to be people who are really enthusiastic about it early on and then it just doesn't pan out other people who out and out reject it and other people who are like them seems like a good idea and i'm in and then they're actually in this tempers expectations this gives us a clearer picture of how people will respond or negatively respond and it provides a bumper kind of like an open world rpg where you get to the edge of the map and you get bounced back into where the story is happening and i think those are the purposes that this serves in addition to what we talked about the last two days which is another demonstration of awe inspiring authority on the part of jesus hey before we're done here did you hear that sound good i mean i heard it i just don't know if it came through on the microphone that was the sound of you and me and all of us
