 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and this is going to be short and very simple. We've been talking about Matthew chapter 13, particularly we've been talking about the parable of the wheat and the weeds. This is the one where Jesus tells him in other parables. He says, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, but while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, the weeds also appeared. And then the owner's servants came to him and said, sir, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Where then did the weeds come from? An enemy did this. Heed the master replied. The servants asked him, do you want us to go and pull them up? No, he answered. Because while you're pulling up the weeds, you may also root up the wheat with them. Let both grow together and tell the harvest. At that time, I will tell the harvesters, first collect the weeds and tie them into bundles to be burned, then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn. Now in our process of working through the Book of Matthew together, we're going straight through the thing, one little chunk at a time every weekday morning, we're not to the part where Jesus actually interprets the parable of the wheat and the weeds. But you're smart and literate and you can tell where a story is going and you know how to read a theme. Surely, even if you've never encountered this parable before, you're already doing the math on more or less where this is going. One of the key components that we're going to break down as we get to Jesus' explanation of his own parable is this business about the servants' attitude versus his attitude. They want to rip the whole thing up because they're angry and in that anger and short-sightedness. They don't see the redeemability of the situation. They don't see the way that burn it down, rip it up, attitude is going to destroy everything, including the good stuff. So here we go. As I record this, yesterday we had our bizarre whatever that thing was at the Capitol Building incident in our country where the officializing the certification of the Electoral College vote occurred. I feel like I've been super upfront with this. I'm going to continue to be super upfront with this as a reminder to everybody and to bring new listeners up to speed on where I stand. I do not like these political parties. I am persuaded by what I read in the book of Matthew about this truer, realer kingdom. The world kingdom is held out as being the opposite, the foil to this kingdom of God that we're being introduced to. In the book of Matthew, it doesn't mean that there's nothing redeemable about it as we're discussing today. It doesn't mean that good things and kingdom things don't play out in the world, but the values and underlying assumptions and trajectory and bloodthirstiness and selfishness of the world kingdom are lampooned in Matthew. And they're constantly criticized sometimes in cold rhetoric, other times in storytelling, other times in pretty overt mockery, sarcasm and even jabbing. So there's my disclaimer back to the thing that happened yesterday. So these people push through the barricades, they break into the Capitol Building, they bust stuff up, they act like idiots. Some people got hurt as I'm recording this. We or I still don't have a clear picture on exactly who did what or what went down. All I know is that I don't like violence and riots and bloodshed and I didn't like that scene. And even though I don't think that relatively small in the grand scheme of things, group of people posed any meaningful, larger threat. They certainly posed a threat in the moment to at least the other folks who were in that building. What we saw there is a bunch of stuff that is violent and wrong and dangerous and a big deal and antithetical to the values of the kingdom. And I know for a lot of people what they saw yesterday is the scariest worst thing they can imagine. For a lot of people, the Capitol Building, that's not just the seat of power. That's their church. That is God. That is where truth and authority comes from. And somebody went into their holy of holies and desecrated it. I'm not trying to minimize the criminal behavior that went on or the destructiveness that went on. I'm trying to do is empathize with the people who don't see the world the way I do and try to understand the full extent of why they were troubled and angry and upset. I'm trying to feel it from their position, from their set of assumptions. So people are upset, transfixed by what was going on. But let me tell you my friends, there was another kind of brutality unfolding at the same time yesterday on social media and in the national conversation. It was amazing to me to watch how fragile everybody's psyche was about this thing as they went and started burning other people down, making these grand proclamations about the irredeem ability of this half of the country or the irredeem ability of that half of the country with no awareness whatsoever that you need the other half of the country. You can't, the other half is just not going away. You can't wash your hands of those people though. I understand it might be a cathartic fantasy for some because once you view the repugnant cultural other as truly repugnant, irredeemable and disgusting in every way, your brain can go to some pretty dark places and you can proudly justify that in front of everybody in print. I saw some amazing stuff yesterday, but I also spent a chunk of yesterday working more on this parable of the wheat and the weeds. So I've got all of that rattling around in my head and then I come back to this. I dang. The owners servants, they think they're trying to do good. They see a problem. They are outraged. They are angry at the dangerous other and they think they're going to do good by tearing it all up, burning it all down, charging into the fray, sickles a swinging, but in the parable, even though their outrage is justified, they are profoundly misguided in their antidote and their action plan coming off of that outrage. They're ready to go and hastily destroy something. They've decided is irredeemable, but the master comes in and pumps the brakes because he sees redeemability in the situation. Now who the enemy is is not clear at this point in the text. So the analogy here for us and what's going on in our world right now is not between the master and whoever wrecked his crop that he's going to go and find out who did it and patch things up. That's another concept for another conversation and another passage. No, the analogy here is the relationship between the master and the field that looks irredeemable and the relationship between the servants and the field that looks irredeemable. One looks at it like the population of Twitter overwhelmingly looks at things and I'm a citizen of Twitter too. So I have to own this as well. Anybody who's there, we have a stake in what's redeemable about Twitter and social media. We have a stake in what's wrong with Twitter and social media, but servants look at this unredeemable situation. This broken world, these broken circumstances and tear it up is their only action plan. Again, the master has a cooler head. The master has a longer view. The master has a view to something much more beautiful than revenge than hasty, angry action than dismissiveness. He sees something there that could still be straightened out. And ultimately, at this present time, thankfully, it's not the job of the servants to go and sort this stuff out, or they would have compounded the evil by losing their heads. Likewise, I don't think it's the job of the angry internet mobs to decide who is irredeemable and write them off and help facilitate their destruction. No, instead, I like the gracious, long-view spiritual model that we get from the parable of the wheat and the weeds, where it is the master's job to figure out how we're going to sort out what happened in this field. And the master, who is the real victim here, is also the calmest and coolest here. So as we move forward, we're going to see that the point of this parable is very big with very far-reaching implications, bigger than what we're talking about today, even. But as we are on this parable, and as I am watching unfold what is unfolded here over the last 24 hours, I'm reminded of and encouraged by this model, this big picture view of ugly, difficult situations. Those servants, they love their master. They want to do things that are true and right and good. And in their fervor, they were ready to make a mistake. The overly angry, self-righteous servants are not irredeemable. The stupid stuff in the messed up field, which represents the world, is also not irredeemable. And though it might look like the whole mess is untended and we need to start burning things down, the master sees that there is something redeemable here. There is something useful here. There is something beautiful here and it's going to require his touch and his mentality and his demeanor to draw that stuff out. And there is value in those of us who value this text, taking stock of that, pumping the breaks and being careful not to dismiss things as irredeemable that the master himself, who's in charge of such proclamations, has not dismissed as irredeemable. I know stuff's weird. I'm feeling it too, but I have tremendous confidence in the master and his ability to redeem stuff. I've experienced it myself. I'm experiencing it in myself now. I know I will need to experience that redemptiveness of the master in myself in the future. And I think that same redemptiveness that I've seen there in me is something that he can do and is doing and will do in the larger scale of things, even when it seems like everything is an ugly, irredeemable mess. He looks at that and sees something different. And I think there's wisdom in us taking our cues from that and not from the understandably angry masses. Thanks for thinking about it with me. Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
