 Don't look at your watch. Don't look at any clock. Put your hands over your eyes. Even if you're driving, even if you can kind of peek just through the fingers, a teeny tiny bit, but not to the part of the car where you have some sort of clock display. What time is it right now? Do you know? Maybe you know because you just looked a couple of minutes ago, maybe you're on your way to work and you always have a pretty precise sense of where you're at when you're at this block or that light or that intersection or whatever. But maybe you've just been out doing stuff and you haven't been paying attention. Maybe you're listening to this while you're hiking or fly fishing. I hope you're listening to this while you're fly fishing. I really hope you are. And if you are, I just remember get the fly upstream. Let it drift slow. If you're not getting anything, just go with a little bit longer drift. Get that stubborn fish a bit more time to look at it. Maybe you're doing that and you've lost track a little bit. Look at the sky. Look at the sun. Look at the signs around you. Does it feel like to you? What broad time of day, not numerically, but descriptively would you call what it is right now? Here's the thing. As we discussed yesterday, even people who are in the exact same time zone as you at the exact same latitude as you may not give the same answer to this question. Because though we have tried to scienceify time and done pretty well at it, time is also still something you feel. It's something that's communicated in impressions and colors as much as it is in numbers. And in the ancient world, we had a different way of counting. The smallest unit of counting time in the classical world, in the ancient world, in the Mediterranean world was with an hour, but an hour wasn't 60 minutes. Well, they were familiar with the concept of a 60 minute hour, I think though I can't say for sure that's born out of Persian mathematics and astronomy. But more so an hour meant what we would call three hours, 180 minutes, and there were 12 such chunks throughout the course of the day. I'm getting all excited again about talking about how they thought about time back then and how we think about time now. We did that yesterday. Here's the point. You got two time markers in all four of these accounts of the gospels that give us some kind of orientation for the day, the schedule of the day when it comes to Jesus Christ's fiction. One of those time markers is the moment at which Jesus was crucified. The other time marker has to do with this time of darkness that we've been talking about where everything got dark and looks like it probably wasn't in the clips and it probably wasn't a sandstorm. It just got dark. It was weird and then it probably got a little bit lighter after that for a little bit before the day was fully out. So let's just look at the text here and try to see if we can see where the discrepancy is. The apparent discrepancy as it works is surprise. I'm going to tell you, I think this actually works out. You might not have seen that coming and then we're going to see what we can do about reconciling them. Matthew 2745. We read this yesterday. Here it is again from the sixth hour until the ninth hour. Darkness came over all the land. All right. So again, that gives us some wiggle room here, but roughly we're looking at anywhere from noon-ish. We could surely perceive that as getting started the sixth hour, which theoretically begins at noon sharp. Somebody could be like, that's 11.15, but I couldn't tell you for sure. We're going to call it the sixth hour. So noon-ish somewhere in the 11 o'clock that sixth hour would then run all the way up till 3 p.m., maybe getting out toward four depending on how somebody perceived it and then running just about till probably till it was about dark given the fact that the text reports that it was dark during that time and not that it just got dark early and then stayed dark. But then we go over here to Mark chapter 15 and verse 25 and it says it was the third hour when they crucified him. And then verse 33, so Mark's going to give us both time indicators. It says, at the sixth hour, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. And then at that ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. And that's the stuff that we were looking at in Psalm 22. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? We'll get to that a little bit later on. So Mark has given us a pretty tight timeframe by ancient standards here. He's saying they crucified him at the third hour, which again, per our ongoing conversation, we know could be anywhere between strictly speaking, nine and noon. But again, this time measurement is a little more opinion than fact. It's a little bit of liquor finger and put it to the metaphorical wind and be like, uh, yeah, let's call it still the third hour. So we could be talking about Mark, whose information was probably relayed to him by Peter. He could be envisioning something that's like nine a.m. And remember if Peter is the source for Mark here, he had a tough night to say the least. It was a long one and you'd have to forgive him a little bit if he wasn't crystal clear on when exactly these hours divided. So based on what Mark is telling us here, it could be that really the end of the first quadrant of daylight. It could be anywhere in the literal third hour or it could easily trickle a ways into what on paper quite literally would have been the sixth hour, but might have still seemed like the third hour to many who were observing. So we got some wiggle room there and then it looks like some time passes, but Mark doesn't really make it clear how much because of the limitations of this ancient timekeeping system when he says that the sixth hour darkness came over for the whole land until the ninth hour. Well, literally speaking, that would mean that anytime between 12.01 p.m. and anytime after three oh one p.m. is what he's talking about. But again, we're ball parking it and we're ball parking it even further because you've lost light as a reference. You've lost that as an orientation point. So in the grandest of senses, this darkness could have started according to Mark as early as around noon or as late as getting toward three or a little bit later. And it could have ended as early as late threes early four o'clock in the afternoon or as late as almost into the evening six p.m. getting on towards seven. There's just, there's a lot of imperfection and wiggle room here. And I guess that's what I'm trying to point out and I'm probably over pointing it out, but y'all's good sports. Luke 23 44. This one, if I recall correctly is a little bit tidier. It was now about the sixth hour and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. So we seem to have a lot of clarity on that. Luke gives us one more detail that I think is pertinent and interesting for the sun stopped shining and then he goes on to talk about the curtain of the temple tearing into which we will get to later on. So we're all getting that sixth to the ninth hour, but man, that is a very broad set of possibilities compared to the precision of our modern timekeeping. John 19 14. I think we only get one time reference from John. And here it is. It was the day of preparation of Passover week about the sixth hour. Here is your king. Pilate said to the Jews, but they shouted, take him away, take him away, crucify him. Wait a minute. Okay. Here's where we run into the problem, right? We're in the sixth hour in John's account and we're still talking with Pilate and we're still having the crowds yelling about stuff. Jesus isn't even crucified yet. And okay, three verses later than he's carrying his own cross. He goes to Golgotha. Here they crucified him. That's verse 18. Well, how long does it take to walk from there to there? Be at least an hour to make the trip maybe more. So okay, the synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke, where they give us these details, they agree that we're going sixth hour to ninth hour somewhere in there for the darkness, but they have Jesus on the cross solidly in the third hour in Mark. And it looks like it would be the third hour according to Matthew and Luke, whereas John is indicating that we're in the sixth hour and we're still figuring things out with Pilate. Well, you've been talking with me for two days about this stuff. I don't even really need to do the work here. You can do it for yourself. There is a massive amount of feathering on either end of each of these four quadrants of ancient timekeeping hours and all kinds of room for interpretation. Perhaps even the vocations of the four people who wrote this might have informed how they viewed the hours or how they divided up their day work wise and might have informed how they thought about when this happened. It is also entirely reasonable to see the Venn diagram between what is the sixth hour and the third hour overlapping and having both John and Mark's description actually line up chronologically very neatly, but just having people eyeballing it and rendering exactly what hour they would call it a little bit differently. Continuity wise, the darkness wraps up in time for it to be observed as being an abnormality that still had light on the end before you got into the first watch or the first quadrant of darkness the evening time. Did I seriously just take two days to lay all of that out and think it through? Oh, yes. Yes, I did. And I had a really good time with it. Bottom line. I understand that some people are troubled by the timeline of the crucifixion events on this particular day between these four accounts. I am not one of those people. I am more than comfortable with the way that it's presented chronologically. It seems to be totally cohesive and to hang together in that regard for me. Hopefully you've got enough to think about what you make of that for yourself and if nothing else, we all have a better sense of just how time worked and what it would be like to think in these categories as the original audience would have thought in these categories. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
