 Hey there, this is Jeff and you're listening to the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. We've been going through Matthew chapter 24 and Matt had a lot to say about the phrase, the abomination that causes desolation, a phrase that Jesus uses in Matthew 24. And he sent me a file that's really two episodes worth of content. So that's what we're going to do with it. Today is part one tomorrow will be part two. Enjoy. So here's where we're at. We're trying to figure out what this parent editorial aside in Matthew chapter 24 that says, let the reader understand means, what are we supposed to understand? No, wait, come back. I still need to know it. I don't understand it. I need to understand. What am I supposed to get? What we've established so far is that this phrase that Jesus uses, and I keep an eye out for this. So when you see this happening, the abomination that causes desolation, that is definitely a reference to the prophet Daniel. How do we know? Because Jesus says spoken of through the prophet Daniel. So what did you and I go do? We looked at all of the places where the theme of profaning the temple comes up in the book of Daniel that included Daniel looking backwards into history from his time at Nebuchadnezzar's profaning of the temple, looking at his own lifetime when Nebuchadnezzar's kid, Belch's are continued in profaning the temple and looking forward in Daniel chapter nine toward some future profaning that is described as an abomination that causes desolation that a lot of people would have said is fulfilled in the rule of Antiochus Epiphanes and the Greeks and all the ways that they profane the temple recorded in 2nd Maccabees chapter six. But Jesus indicates that you should be keeping an eye out for this abomination that causes desolation as though it was still to happen. So in the interest of letting the reader understand, let's consider the possibilities of what Jesus might have meant by this. Possibility number one is that he is acknowledging that there's going to be a repetition somewhere in the future of a thing that has already happened in the past. And Jesus is looking backwards as well when he says this. And so what he's really trying to communicate is, hey, you guys remember what happened last time the temple was profaned, like it got violent and things really changed. So there's something coming up in the vein, something that's going to be very reminiscent of what happened with Nebuchadnezzar, maybe Belch's are maybe with Antiochus Epiphanes. You guys have seen this kind of stuff before, something like that is coming again, and you need to be responsive when that happens. Again, it's possible that Jesus is drawing on past experience to say that has happened and it will happen again, be ready to move when that does happen. Possibility, and this is just something that we have to acknowledge is possible. I don't think it's the best read, but maybe is that Jesus is entirely looking back here. And his answer in Matthew 24 to the disciples about when everything's going to go down is just so very out of order chronologically that the obvious read just misses what he means here. And then what he's really talking about is an abomination that causes desolation that has already happened. And maybe what Jesus means is like, remember that because that that was a big deal. And so in that case, if Jesus is actually looking backwards when he says, you know, so when you see standing in the holy place, the abomination that causes desolation, then maybe he is speaking from the position of Daniel. He could be talking about what Nebuchadnezzar did, what Balsar did, what Antiochus Epiphanes and the Greeks did could be any of that. And it's just sort of an image or a reminder to help people learn the lessons of the past in order to be ready for the future. I don't think that makes the most sense if he's referencing the Daniel 9 prophecy about the abomination that causes desolation. I think he's talking about a future profaning of the temple that had not happened yet, which would take us to possibility number two, which would be that Jesus here is talking about something that the disciples need to be ready for because it is imminent. This is something they are going to see in their lifetimes. And if that's the case, then pretty obviously what he's talking about is the destruction of the temple in AD 70, which would be just a few decades down the road as he was saying these words. In that case, he would be drawing on the historical examples from Daniel of the profaning of the temple, but he would also be drawing on that Daniel 9 prophecy about a future profaning that had not yet happened, but he would be saying or suggesting that that profaning is going to end up being the Romans. And when they destroy the temple, as Jesus has been pointing to in the previous pages and chapters, well, then that will be this horrifying day. And the reader should be aware and people who are followers of Jesus should be ready to react, respond and get out of dodge. And that read on the text that this abomination that causes desolation is the destruction of the temple, the profaning of the temple that occurs there in 70 AD, I think is supported by the corresponding passage over in Luke 21, where the details, I'm sorry, I don't know right where it is. It looks like starting in verse 20, where the details of that are a bit more specific and where Matthew's account is a touch vague, Luke makes it sound like that's 70 AD. I mean, here's what it reads. When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you'll know that its desolation is near. Oh, desolation is not word. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city, get out and let those in the country not enter the city. For this is the time of punishment and fulfillment of all that has been written, how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers. There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all of the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. Again, we're talking about prophecy and Jesus intentionally withholding enough detail to piece everything together. So it's all ultimately going to be a little bit unsatisfying other than to say, yeah, if we look at Matthew and Luke, it maybe does look a little bit more like what Jesus has in mind is something that is coming within the lifetimes of the disciples who asked the question. There is a third possibility as to what Jesus is pointing toward here, though, when he says the abomination that causes desolation. And that would be toward the distant future and some other thing that's going to happen way down the road. And for that, we need to go to a book that I don't think we've ever been to together before. And that is second Thessalonians. And here's an interesting thing. I don't totally know the order of the books of the Bible, even though I've been doing this and I've been around this since like I was old enough to talk and walk because this is what my dad was into and this, I don't know. I've just been around the Bible a lot and yeah, confession. If he's asked me to sit down and like reel off all the books of the Bible, like a kid can do, I can't do it. I have to think really hard about like, okay, what comes right after that? What's the next question? Why is the Bible arranged this way? Oh, yeah, the next thing would be that. But I got a trick for first and second Thessalonians, first and second Timothy and Titus, all the T books in the New Testament go together and they go both in alphabetical order as well as longest name of a book, two shortest name of a book. You see what I'm saying? So first and second Thessalonians, those are the long ones. First and second Timothy, that's a shorter name for the book, fewer letters. And then Titus is the shortest ones. You can remember the order or you can just go alphabetical T H T I T I M and then T I T U S. And you know, it works like that. Look at that. We're learning together and we're having fun. Not the point. The point is that second Thessalonians takes a bit of a look forward in this letter written by Paul and in verses, starting verse three, we get a little bit more of a hint about maybe some sort of future unfolding of things that might even be beyond the destruction of the temple and 70 AD. It says, don't let anyone deceive you in any way for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped so that he sets himself up in God's temple proclaiming himself to be God. Ah, there's that profaning of the temple theme yet again. And just from that narrow context there in second Thessalonians, let alone from the larger context, which we did not look at, you get the impression that's not talking about 70 AD. That's talking about something that comes more like much later in the unfolding of things. And so that brings us back to this difficult question of just what does Jesus mean? You said, let the reader understand. I need to know what did you mean? What did you mean? All right, look, I think the only way that we can read this, if we look at this through line of all of the repetitions of the theme of the profaning of the temple and what that means for the unfolding of things throughout history and in the future, if we look at that and take all of the data, it seems like he's kind of talking about all of it. And I don't really know that there's a neat, tidy, flawless way to read it in any other direction. And that's our pause point for today. Come back next time for the conclusion of this discussion.
