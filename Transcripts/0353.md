 What's up my friends? I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. We are in a deep dive into this passage Matthew 15 21 through 28. It's a tricky passage because it looks like Jesus is just blowing off this foreigner lady who needs his help But then when he finally does talk to her it looks like he's pretty harsh with her We're trying to figure out why the tone what is being accomplished here Why is Matthew even including this in his document doesn't it make Jesus look bad? And we're about I don't know halfway ish through our process of trying to figure out what the heck is going on here I have no idea where we're resuming because I recorded this whole thing at once So I'm gonna have Jeff play some music and we're just gonna pick it up wherever we left off yesterday So okay for me after the first time I really sat and thought about this and broke it down It cut through some of that. She says what are you doing impulse that I felt and if I really think about the exchange I feel a little bit better about it, but there's a lot to break down here And I'm not even sure where to start So I'm just gonna pick things make some observations and we'll see if we can make sense of this So we've already acknowledged this motif of Jesus having a soft spot for the Gentiles and them being able to identify him Further we've acknowledged the repetition of this motif where women in the Gospels Seem to identify Jesus and be willing to take that desperate step to go and get his attention But third I think there's something that's sitting in plain sight here that needs to be acknowledged as well And that's that again Jesus praises an outsider for their faith He did the exact same thing again I'm turning pages and I don't know why in Matthew chapter 8 when he says I tell you the truth I've not found anyone in Israel with such great faith I say to you that many will come from the East and West and we'll take their places at the feast with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth There's this idea throughout the whole gospel and John the Baptist hits on it as well That just saying we have Abraham as our father is not what makes you a part of the kingdom It's not what really makes you a part of this family of faith that God is building through Jesus And that the actual family of faith will not be made up of self-righteous people who created extra biblical laws and traditions That they engage in ruthless accountability with each other over But rather this actual family of faith is going to be well just that faith It's going to be people who have embraced and been changed by the values of the kingdom It's going to be people who give away and reflect those values of the kingdom It's going to be people who bend the knee to the king. I mean what is a kingdom? It's the the subjects of the king and so that which makes someone a subject of this kind of a king is To bend the knee to that kind of a king which this lady is doing figuratively and literally so in addition to the still developing motif of Jesus dealing with Gentiles and women being bold and Insistent in pursuing Jesus when they see who he is in the gospels We also add to it this much more theologically weighty motif that of the new family of faith And this new family of faith is filled with people who have faith and this family is filled with weird-looking people If you were to build a religion and draw the circle around the demographic You would expect to have in that religion. It would not look like what you're getting here at all. The kingdom is Trippy it apparently completely rejects the demographic lumping that we are accustomed to at any age in any culture And instead people with serious problems people who are a part of seriously the wrong group Depending on who you're talking to people who talk the wrong way and look the wrong way and are into the wrong kind of stuff They end up being in the kingdom and the people who believe they have eyes wide open and see everything for exactly how it is They the ones who believe that they see everything so clearly and are most obviously in or maybe actually not So in a not so subtle way this uncomfortable interaction between these two parties Further advances this theme of the true people of god who are my mother my brother My sisters as being the people who believe in Jesus and in this case in every way the people who assume a right posture before the king She didn't get everything about theology. She didn't get everything about exactly who Jesus was across the board But she recognized his authority and his goodness and his power and she responded accordingly something much better educated people were not able to get right So then back to the bajillion dollar question though What actually happened in this exchange that gets us to this point a couple of different possibilities one Jesus was tired and cranky and he was just in a foul mood and he was being a jerk And this lady came along it was pestering him and i'm like just not now my cousin got beheaded And i've been walking forever and my feet hurt and i'm trying to have a corporate retreat And you're just like you're ruining it. I'm always Healing and stuff and I just I just can't today and then eventually she got pushy and he softened and was like okie dokie I'll remember interpretive principle number one or maybe we counted as interpretive principle number two of the bible Is interpret the less clear in light of the more clear Do we see those kind of off days from jesus anywhere else? No, I don't think we do Do we see incredible shrewdness and precision from jesus in other places where he chooses his words and his interaction style In a way that is designed to teach Oh, well. Yeah, we do. I think of matthew 19 here in a couple chapters where he has the interaction with the rich young ruler I think of some of the clever rhetorical questions that he bounces back at people to make them think about stuff Yeah, that we see him just being a jerk for a while. We don't see so is it possible that he was being a jerk and matthew Was just writing down like he was just a jerk that day. I mean, I I guess so But I think whether we're a person of faith or not faith The better read within the boundaries of the text and the assumptions that we draw from the context Is that instead of some sort of evil mind controller him being a jerk what we're actually getting here is some sort of very clever Turn of a phrase to navigate this exchange in a way that makes this larger point for his disciples I don't even know if it's for the lady In such a way that it fulfills the training they're receiving on this corporate retreat road trip that they're taking up north into gentile territory If that's the case, it maybe goes something like this She comes along and says son of david at mercy on me My daughter is suffering terribly from demonic possession and jesus is like okay. Well, I'm gonna heal that kid This is interesting and here's how i'm gonna do it. So he strolls along quietly Letting the disciples who he's trying to very intentionally train up during this time. He's gonna let them figure it out What are they gonna do jesus doesn't tip his hand at all one way or the other And the disciples do what they did when the kids were coming up to jesus and interrupting their important religious time And they're like, ah, I got these kids out of here and jesus is like quit being stupid The kids stay in fact the kid thing is great And there's something about the heart of a kid that gets it in ways that you guys aren't getting it right now Is it possible that we're seeing another such teachable moment from jesus? Might be so the disciples tip their hand. They're like she needs to go away, but jesus answers them Well, I was only sent to the lost sheep of israel Now Clearly that is not his final answer We already know again from matthew eight that he has an interest in people who aren't jewish And also he's not in israel right now and also He's gonna do a whole bunch more stuff and say a whole bunch more stuff that indicates that This thing is for everybody and was always ultimately intended for everybody And jesus is very familiar with the abrahamic covenant In which god tells abraham That he and his descendants are going to be a blessing to all the nations So I can't believe that jesus is making an ultimate and final statement here that no I'm really only here for this one thing. I'm not really interested in anything beyond that Instead it looks like he's repeating an expectation Back at them now. This sounds a little bit like matthew chapter 10 That being the missional discourse where right off the bat he tells the very same disciples Don't go among the gentiles or enter any town of the samaritans go rather to the lost sheep of israel Oh, it's almost the exact same phraseology But then the rest of matthew 10 Goes on to one affirm the idea of being shrewd and innocent Which I think is the exact techniques he's employing here to navigate this conversation But to jesus words in the missional discourse of matthew chapter 10 indicate that these guys are headed for a Much broader audience. This thing is going to go global Everything about the context there at the beginning of chapter 10 Indicates that for now you guys are going to be in the phase of going just to the lost sheep of israel But part two and part three of the missional discourse give all kinds of verbal cues that this is going to go much further than that Is jesus then by drawing on that exact same phraseology he used at the beginning of chapter 10 Suggesting to them like what do you think guys? Is it time to shift into the phase two that we had talked about? And while they're still thinking about what jesus meant by that answer the woman's like yeah, whatever But my kids deem him possessed and her life is being ruined. So at any rate I'm sure all of that theology is very important, but she's begs help me And we're still not done increasingly. I'm coming to view This passage as the halfway point of the book of matthew now the chapters and verses and stuff I know you're probably doing math on like 28 chapters. We're part way through 15 Is this really halfway all of that stuff is after the fact and so I don't know word count if this puts us at the halfway point or not But it seems like This departure from jewish territory this trip up north and particularly this exchange with this lady Is drawing on a whole bunch of the themes we've been poking at for a while and I just need more time to unpack that with you So we're going to hit pause there and rejoin all of this tomorrow I'm matt. This is the 10 minute bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon
