 The greatest stories, the ones that shape you and influence you, that become iconic culturally, those great stories have at least one thing in common. The great ones all have very pronounced themes. They're dealing with something. They're doing something. Not just telling a story for the sake of telling a story to get from A to Z and make a couple bucks. They want to say something. You might not always like the themes. You might not always agree with the themes, but the stuff that makes a dent, societally or in your own mind, heart, psyche, they always have these themes that maybe you don't catch on your first pass. But when you think back on it, you're like, oh, wow, look at the way the author introduced that theme and then teased out those notes as we went along with the story. So much so that if I named some of the great movie franchises of the last several decades, you are all going to come to the same conclusions or conjure the same thematic images in your mind. In fact, let's just do it. Here we go. Ready? I say a movie or movie franchise. You say the themes that are most pronounced. Rocky. What'd you come up with? Part of a champion, right? Learn how to take a hit and get back up. Star Wars. Hope. And spark of rebellion standing up for what is right, even if it costs you Harry Potter, friendship, loyalty, right? The Matrix, reality, truth, seeing things for what they actually are. And here's the granddaddy of mall, the Lord of the Rings, the allure and corrupting nature of power, the glory of men lost long ago, but possibly restored humility, purity, beauty, simplicity, and all of those themes are introduced in the relatively early going and then drawn back into the conversation as the parameters of the plot evolves and the characters evolve. Well, now we come back and we explore that theme again and you see it from a little different angle and those great themes challenge and change you. People don't go out and get pop sockets with branding from Keanu Reeves speed. People don't name their pets after characters from Will Smith and Kevin Klein's Wild Wild West. People don't get tattoos of something inspired by sudden death with Jean Claude Van Damme. People do all that stuff. People name their kids after characters from Lord of the Rings. Why? Because those themes connect with people and they're artfully interspersed, not always with this heavy hand or right through the front door loudly, but they're built into the story in a way that brings you along with it and causes you to grow as the story unfolds. Likewise the Bible, the Gospels, Matthew, the teachings, the words of Jesus have such staying power, not just because there's the credible claim of deity behind it, but even for people who don't think there's a deity behind it, it has staying power because it's thematically beautiful and because it's a growth document that speaks to the heart of human beings, it understands humans and to read through it is to be challenged and to grow. When we look at the speeches of Jesus in Matthew chapter 5 and then moving forward throughout the rest of Matthew, the themes are very evident. You got this kingdom. The kingdom is better than anything else that competes with it. It's the truest, realist thing ever. It has a king. The right response to this king is to assume a posture of humility and servitude before the king. The king by his benevolence grants admission to the kingdom. It's his to give, it's his to take away, but he's generous with it. What he wants is people who see the values of the kingdom and want to orient their hearts, not just their actions to what that kingdom is about. You and I spend a ton of time on those themes as we took what months to work through the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5 through 7, Jesus' first big public speech described in the book of Matthew. But now we're into Matthew chapter 10 and we're looking at this thing called the missional discourse. And if Matthew were a crappy writer and the Bible were a crappy book, then we would expect this next speech in Matthew chapter 10 to be a completely different thing. Jesus is worried about other issues now. Yeah, kingdom stuff, that was the other day. But now I've been thinking about these other things or something new came on the news. And now I want to talk about the new thing that's in the new news cycle, but no, no, no, no, the kingdom is the message. And so unsurprisingly, all of those themes about suffering as a part of this kingdom about the values of the kingdom, but the upside down nature of the kingdom about giving away the things that you've been given about not worrying about trusting the king for his provision, even about the idea that the king is responsible for judgment. And that can be a very terrifying thing. All of those themes are on display once again in this commissioning speech of Matthew chapter 10. And what I want to accomplish with the rest of the time that we're spending together today is to look at those themes that were introduced in the Sermon on the Mount and now are manifesting again. I alluded to one of them yesterday, but let's just break it down. The first theme that gets introduced heavily in the Sermon on the Mount and then comes up again in the missional discourse of Matthew chapter 10 is simply the broad theme of the kingdom in general. The message has not changed. The kingdom is here in Matthew 10, seven. Jesus sends out his disciples and says, as you go preach this message, the kingdom of heaven is near, healed the sick, raised the dead, cleansed those who have leprosy, drive out demons, tell them the kingdom is here and then show them stuff. But the prophets of old said what happened when the kingdom arrived. So again, what we have here is not a departure from some stuff that Jesus put time into. And then now he's on to some other message. No, no, no, the theme is being struck again. And this would be very familiar to the ears of his disciples and Matthew's original audience. The second repeating theme is in the very next sentence of verse eight, freely you have received freely give. You remember all of that stuff in the Sermon on the Mount about if you've received forgiveness, give it away? That's actually the thing that gets Jesus into his explanation of the very famous Lord's prayer. It's all about this idea that if you've been given a kingdom values thing by God, the only thing that makes sense if it's actually affected you and if God actually has your heart is that you would want to give that good and redeeming stuff away to other people. A third theme that is re-preased here in Matthew chapter 10 from the Sermon on the Mount is that of persecution. And it is all over the place in the middle of this speech. I mean, you've seen it. We've been talking about it starting in verse 17. It gets into all this stuff about you're going to be in front of powerful people. They're going to arrest you. You're going to get flogged. Don't worry. I'll be with you speaking through you. All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. And you're persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth. All of this language right here is drawing on the very beginning of the Sermon on the Mount where the values of the kingdom, the Beatitudes include the idea that you will likely suffer for being a part of this truer, realer kingdom with this different set of values. Another repeated theme brought up in the Sermon on the Mount repeated in the Missional Discourse is that of treasures in heaven. It's not explicit. We don't have that smoking gun verse here, but the idea that it's worth it to endure all of this persecution, that it's worth it to be a part of this kingdom. And then you got two things you can pick treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy thieves break in and steal or treasures in heaven that last forever and are secure. A fifth theme that comes up in the Sermon on the Mount and then is invoked again in the Missional Discourse of Matthew 10 is this idea about not worrying because God is king. The kingdom is real. His provision will be perfect and you don't have to worry about the difficult stuff that you're going to run into even though it will be difficult. There's even an invocation of the same language. Look at the birds of the air, Matthew, chapter seven from the Sermon on the Mount. They don't sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can at a single day do his life? Fast forward to Matthew 10, the Missional Discourse. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body and hell. We'll cover that later. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of the Father and even the very hairs on your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows. It's not an accident that Jesus is hitting these themes again anymore than it's not an accident. The gin or so keeps going on and on about hope in Rogue One drawing on the name of the first Star Wars movie, a new hope. It's all very, very on purpose. A sixth theme. Are we on seven? Are we on seven now? I think I'm counting it wrong. This is the idea of judgment at the end of Matthew chapter seven. You get this horrifying part of the Bible where Jesus is like, you know, watch out for all of these false prophets and not everybody says to me, Lord, Lord, we'll enter the kingdom of heaven. And there'll be a lot of people like, what? Didn't we do this? And didn't we do that? And I'll say I never knew you. Likewise in the Missional Discourse, we double down on this theme of God's just judgment. Again, I don't want to do it. I'm not qualified to do it. I'm not able to dish it out, but the God of the universe chooses to judge. He's authoritative to do so. Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my father in heaven. This is Matthew 10 again, the Missional Discourse. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my father in heaven. Now, fairness, I understand that some of you might listen to this and be like, I kind of see some of those themes. I think you might be stretching it a little bit, but this is one of those places where I'm just going to come back here and say, no, I don't, I really don't think I am. I think it's there. I think it's intentional just as much as I think you and I both know it's intentional when every time the theme of power comes up in the Lord of the Rings, you get the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, theme, or every time the lost glory of men comes up, you get the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, la the theme, or just like every time beauty and simplicity comes up you get that Shire theorem back and forth thing, or just like every time beauty and simplicity comes up. You get that Shire are theme Stall, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. They're all there. For a reason, it's to subtly evoke the things you felt and the things that you caught even if it was in the secret part of your brain when those meaningful beats were brought up earlier in the story. Likewise here, I think Matthew, I think Jesus are on the same page that certain themes that needed to be introduced that are vital for shaping the reader and for communicating the message in both the overt overtone ways that you can't miss and the subtle undertone ways that make stuff get through the armor and actually change you and affect you. Those things are repeated on purpose. They're introduced and they're going to continue to be invoked throughout the narrative. The reason I wanted to step aside today and take a little extra time to look at this was in part to just give full treatment to all of the wrinkles and layers of the missional discourse, but also to set us up for success as we move forward in Matthew so that we can have our antenna out all the more for when those little themes play so that we can connect better at the intellectual level and also so that we can connect better at the level of the soul and the conscience as we work through the text. Thanks for tolerating my singing. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
