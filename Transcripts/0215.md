 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And as always, I know you got a billion things you could be doing, and yet here we are. So I just don't want you to ever think that that's lost on me. Thank you for making the time to hang out. I really do appreciate it. And also I want to put a disclaimer at the front end of this episode. So we're going to do a little thought exercise here that's going to get us close to the political. But it isn't political in nature. I ain't saying nothing, nothing. If anything, not only am I not endorsing one presidential candidate or the other in the United States presidential election, if anything I'm doing what I always do, which is intentionally endorsing nobody, nobody for president once again is probably the closest thing to my opinion. So whatever lines you want to read between here, you're reading them wrong. Exercise commencing. What one single word do you Americans or non-Americans? Because I know whether you want to or not, you have our dumb elections inflicted on you. What single word would you most associate with the Trump candidacy and Trump presidency? There's probably a lot of them that you'd come up with, probably some of you do some snarky things. I don't care if you like him or don't like him, come on. What word is great, right? Great. Is the word that seems to fit and stand out. Let's do the exact same thing from the other side of the political aisle. What do you associate with the Obama candidacy and his presidency? This was not hard. It's change, right? And I didn't really think about going back any further, but Bush would be probably strategic, wouldn't it? I was thinking like mission accomplished, but that's kind of a dig. I think it would be strategic. Did you know, did you know that he has a podcast or maybe it's the Bush Center has a podcast? The podcast is called like the strategarist. I was sat in my life making fun of the guy and he leaned into the joke. I absolutely love it. The point is with very prominent characters in our lifetimes, there is a branding process that happens whether you want it to or not. And there is a word or a couple of words that become very associated with the ideology and the agenda of that character. Guess what? Surprise. We're going to talk about the Bible and Jesus and stuff now because it's what we do. So likewise, there are some words that we might associate with the Jesus campaign or the Jesus, you can't really call it a presidency, the Jesus ministry king ship time. Now the words you're probably going to think of off the top of your head that Jesus used a lot that keep coming up thematically, it's going to be a Christian sounding, right? Like grace or forgiveness or God. Those are all great words and they're in there and those concepts are present. But you know what? I think you could make a really good case that the great change or a strategic of Jesus is sheep. I think about it. It comes up all over the place and not even just in the New Testament. It's not like Jesus just out of the blue is like, I'm going to start talking about sheep a whole bunch. It comes up all over the Old Testament and it seems to have one very specific connotation that Jesus is drawing on. Honestly, the connotation hasn't changed a bit in all these years. You hear people on the internet making fun of people. They think don't think about stuff. What do they call them? Sheep, sheeple, wake up. I mean that sheep thing, I mean somebody who isn't paying attention and you've got the wool that's down over your eyes. You can't tell what's going on very well and if everybody else does it, you just kind of go along because sheep have this. I really want to fit in with everybody else thing that's built in. Unsurprisingly, when Jesus employs the term sheep, it isn't flattering, but it is affectionate. I think it's really important to note that as we work our way through Matthew 10 because on either side of the Matthew 9, Matthew 10 divide is Jesus invoking one of his very favorite words, very favorite concepts again, that being sheep. Remember how chapter 9 wraps up when Jesus says when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd. And he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers, if you ask the Lord and the harvest therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. By the way, this episode is brought to you by Matthew chapter 9 verses 37 and 38. We're going to repeat this so much. You might as well just take a couple of days to put in your brain and you've got a weekend coming up. This harvest is plentiful thing really gets us into the narrative trajectory that we're on right now and that we're on moving forward. So maybe just jam that one in your brain somewhere. But then we get to the other side of the Matthew chapter 9, Matthew chapter 10 divide. And Jesus starts talking again in the very next set of red letters that we get from him has this same idea of sheep. He tells his 12 disciples, don't go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans, go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. So a second ago, I was saying the sheep thing, it's not an insult. It's an acknowledgement of weakness and frailty and directionlessness. But there's this affection, there's this tenderness, this care. Jesus doesn't look at that like the people who go on the internet and in all caps type, wake up sheeple. Well, that person despises the sheeple. That person believes they are so much better when in reality, they're not. They're probably sheeple about some other thing that they've got the wool pulled over their eyes on. So there's a degree of hypocrisy going on when we call each other sheep and mock each other because we're oh so enlightened and everyone else is oh such a big idiot. We're all dumb about something, right? I mean, we can live with that. It's okay. But Jesus isn't. He sees how all the things are and he would have every right to be like, I'm just so much better than these people. Oh, you guys are trying my patience because of how dumb you are. How can you not see? If you could just open your eyes, like eyes that I have that transcend time and distance and knowledge and allow me to see all truth unfolding simultaneously before my eyes that are beyond singularly dimensional and I can be the nowhere of all truth. If you could just do that, you would see it too. No. Jesus understands that he's pretty exceptional. I mean being, you know, the one entity that predates existence and that called existence out of non-existence at one time and being like immortal and unlimited in every way and somebody who's always known everything and has never had to change has never learned anything or evolved in any way. Like he understands, you know, I'm a little bit different. I'm on a little bit of a different plane than the kiddos over here. So they're not going to get everything. So there is this compassion that goes with it. And I think that runs all the way through the Bible every time we run into this sheep thing. There's no way for me to cover all the sheep stuff, but I want to go back to three of the great big giant prophets of the Old Testament. Each of them have a sheep passage. Isaiah 53, we've been on Isaiah 53 how many times because so much of what Jesus is doing draws directly from the stuff that gets talked about in this particular chapter. And here we are again with all of this language on the front end of Isaiah 53 about this servant, despised and rejected by man. It's Jesus, hand to man of sorrows and familiar with suffering like one from whom men hide their faces. He was despised and we esteemed him not, but surely took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him and afflicted, but he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed. Now you remember all of that stuff probably has rich, thick, creamy, milky Bible prophecy pointing toward Jesus in the context of the Messiah. But listen to verse six, we all like sheep have gone astray. Each of us has turned to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. So Jesus isn't just hitting on this sheep thing. A contextually, he's drawing on something that everybody would know. I say Isaiah 53 was very popular back then as it is very popular now. I mean, even if you only have Easter and Christmas to have this stuff repeated to you again and again, it's drilled into your brain. And we're not even like really hardcore into religion like the original audience here, the original Jewish audience was. This was drilled into their brain. You say the word sheep that was loaded just like if you're an American right now and you say the word great or America great or make America great, no one is going to disconnect that from the Trump candidacy in presidency. You say the word change in a political context again and again. Nobody's going to disconnect that from the Obama presidency. And if you say, strategic, people might not be sure if you mean Bush or Will Ferrell's version of Bush, but they're going to get a laugh out of it and know exactly what you're talking about there jumping over from Isaiah 53 to Jeremiah 50. Jeremiah is one of these books that if you haven't checked in on it in a long time, it can be really confusing because it's a book that gives us the most out of context verse in all of history. The one that people get lower back tattoos of in some kind of old English script and treated as like this really positive, happy message from God who's always looking out for me like God's first priority is that he has plans to prosper me and not to harm me. And whoa, wow. Jeremiah strikes a very different tone than that lower back tattoo. Jeremiah strikes a tone of, yeah, you guys got problems being written to the last remaining people of the Southern Kingdom who were about to get hauled away into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar and what ends up being 586 B.C. And it's like the end of the Northern Kingdom and the Southern Kingdom and Jeremy's like, yeah, that's what's happening. So anyways, here's some instructions for what to expect along the way and how things are going to go. But it's dark and it's difficult. And for you and me, it's easy to read this from a distance and be like, oh, wow, yeah, that is very troubling language. But just think about how you feel regardless of what you believe about politics and everything else. The West feels in jeopardy right now. The whole tradition feels weird. Like their fissures, their rumblings, their little seismic shifts occurring. And everybody I know, regardless of which direction they might happen to lean politically, feels a little bit unsettled. Well, this wasn't a little bit unsettled. This was a train wreck disaster. Everything is gone. Everything is ruined. This is why Jeremiah is the guy responsible for lamentations. He's the guy who's referred to as the weeping prophet. And he's crystal clear. I mean, he's got a God-infused bird's eye perched for taking all of this in and knowing exactly what went wrong and look at the language he employs in Jeremiah 50. And I really should say, look at the language that specifically the text attributes to God through Jeremiah. So this is God's language according to the text. Jeremiah 50 verse one says, this is the word of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah, the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians. And again, as Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom. And then we'll jump ahead to verse four. It says, in those days at that time declares the Lord, the people of Israel and the people of Judah together will go in tears to seek the Lord their God. They'll ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward it. They'll come and bind themselves of the Lord in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten. Verse six, every God will smoke and gun. My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds have led them astray and caused them to roam on the mountains. They wandered over mountain and hill and forgot their own resting place. Whoever found them devoured them. Their enemies said, we're not guilty, but they sinned against the Lord. Their true pasture, the Lord, the hope of their fathers, God himself using the language to say, my people have been lost sheep and even blames it on bad shepherding, which is really interesting because next time around when we jump over to the New Testament, we're going to see more language about good shepherding. And that would have jumped off the page to an enormously scripturally literate original audience. This is what they read. This is what they talked about. This was the centerpiece of literature and thought and don't think for a second, just because we might not be able to pull these verses off the top of our heads that the people back then couldn't. They could and they knew exactly what theme, what language, even what passages Jesus was drawing on whenever he talks about sheep and the good shepherd versus the bad shepherd and all of that that we will break down more next time around. So here's what we're going to do. I got one more Old Testament passage that I want to look at with you in our next conversation. And I want to look at how the sheep thing unfolds a little bit more in the New Testament. More on that next time around ginormous high five to everybody who supports this podcast at patreon.com slash the TMBH podcast because seriously, those of you in the small minority of listeners who support the program, you make the thing happen for everybody and there's a guilt there. I just think that's awesome. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
