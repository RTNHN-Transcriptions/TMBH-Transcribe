 My father's final words were, love her as I have loved her and there will be joy. I don't know if that's actually right. That's pretty close to what Prince Hompardink said, right? When he announced that he had a new bride or he was engaged, it's real close to that. The last words thing is interesting. Sometimes I think about, like, oh, man, what would I want to say with my last stuff on the way out the door? When you're young, I think it's some idealistic freedom fighter thing that you probably want to say. I'm going to change the world with these words. And then I think in middle age, more often you would find that people's answers would be some kind of vindication. These people, they were wrong about me and I'm going to stick it to them with these last words. The people who get their last words in when they're older, they've realized they're not going to get the vindication they want. Or maybe they realized that they had some part and things that went wrong in their life too. And it seems like they just want to say stuff about the people they love. I want to hang on a sec. I am pulling a thing up. I want to talk about famous last words here. So I'm searching this famous last words. Looks like mental floss is the article that I got first. What do we got here? Rafael, not the ninja turtle. The artist, his last words were, oh, no, it's just one happy. It's pretty good. Frank Sinatra said I'm losing it. That's tough. Oh, wow. George Orwell. This is awesome. At 50, everyone has the face he deserves. He died at 46. I did not know that. That's a pretty good one. What else we got? No, no, Stradamus predicted his own death. Tomorrow at sunrise, I shall no longer be here. Apparently he was right about that. That's a pretty good one. I was going to quit after a couple, but it's really interesting. Harriet Tubman gathered her family around and they sang together. So her last words were, swing low, sweet chariot. That seems like a nice place to end this little exercise. But you've thought about it, right? What you would say if you just had one last crack at saying something in front of people, do you want to go for defiance? Do you want to go for soft-heartedness? Do you want to make some grand philosophical point? Do you want to make people laugh on the way out the door? I don't know. I haven't got this one solved. I'm glad I'm not faced with that question right this second. The last words of Jesus that Matthew records are, Eloy Eloy La Ma Subaktani or, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? But Matthew does acknowledge a little bit later on here that he cried out that he said something else. So verse 50 of Matthew 27, Matthew says, and when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. Now for whatever reason, maybe we'll talk about it. Maybe we won't. Matthew withholds the detail of what Jesus says next. I guess why tease it, why not just tackle it right now? We've talked about how much Matthew is emphasizing the theme of abandonment, this idea that Jesus is fulfilling and completing the law that he is taking the sins of the world upon him with this, that he is this sacrificial lamb that can cover all of the bases, though that language is a little more spelled out over in John. And so it makes sense that to round out this theme, Matthew's been big time developing that he would leave Jesus final words as being this quote over in John. We've got an account of Jesus handing off care of his mother to John. And then we have him saying that he's thirsty. And then finally we have him saying it is finished. So we have recording of Jesus saying a few final words. I don't know which of those Matthew is thinking of when he says that he cried out again and a loud voice. My guess is that wouldn't be the handing off of his mother. It seems like something you would say a little more tenderly as much as you can muster it under that kind of duress. And so maybe it is finished is what Matthew is referencing there in verse 50. But those final words that we get Matthew spelling out are super interesting and compelling because of what the words actually say. But they're also interesting because they're in Aramaic. And when you think about like, whoa, you know, what languages was the Bible written in? Okay. Most people can recall and it's okay if you can't. But most people can recall that because of the hijinks of Alexander the Great, a few centuries before Jesus Greek had really become the lingua franca of the Eastern Mediterranean world, really the whole world. And so the gospels were written in Greek. New Testament was written in Greek and most people, you know, it's okay. Again, if you don't have this up the top of your head, but I would guess that a lot of people could say like, Oh, it's Jewish people Hebrews is probably written in Hebrew. And the Old Testament would be in Hebrew. Yeah, that's right. But parts of the Bible, Daniel, this little nugget right here appear in Aramaic. And that's odd because Aramaic, you mean like, you know, Aram, like what does Aram have to do with anything? I mean, why would the language that Jesus spoke and ran around, you know, having conversations and why would that not be some sort of Hebrew? Hebrew existed at this point in history, but it was largely reserved for written biblical scrolls and the work of the Jewish religious leaders, some of that would have been happening in Hebrew. But for the most part, the ethnic conversational language would have been Aramaic, but people would have been varying degrees functional in Greek as well. And as a requirement of getting along with the occupying government, a lot of the legal language would have been first presented in Latin. And indeed, we see that the signage around the crucifixion was presented in more than one language reflective of this cosmopolitan place and this cosmopolitan time at the intersection of a bunch of cultures and languages. For whatever reason, Jesus chooses to use Aramaic here, a language that really, I guess you're going to trace it to Persia, right? The Persians in the sixth century under Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, Arctic Xerxes, they seem to latch on to Aramaic as a catch all language for communicating with their very diverse subjects across their massive empire that stretched as far as Egypt. And as we talked to Cyrenaica into modern day Libya, as far East as India, as far North as up into modern day Southern Russia, even modern day Southern Ukraine and Turkey and Anatolia as a big empire. And they used their own language of the Persians. They used Greek in the Eastern Empire, but they relied on Aramaic quite a bit. And the Jewish people came back and they rebuilt the temple and everything in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and the book of Esther is a little bit before that. But all of that was with the blessings of the Persians who were seeming to want to advance this Aramaic language because for whatever reason, they estimated that it was an efficient and useful language that looked enough like a bunch of other ancient languages that there would be overlap there and that they could efficiently govern diverse people using it. So it's kind of wild that that is the history that trickles down through the centuries to this moment and that this pivotal line, these famous last or almost last words are spoken in that curious language. That means something, my friends. This is not Hebrew. The language Jesus chose to use in crying out to his father was a language that had been embraced by the Hebrews and been hebraified in every way. But this was a language of the outsiders imposed on the ancient Near East and the Levant by Gentiles. So even this language, I think, is indicative of how Matthew is advancing this theme and how Jesus is advancing this idea that the kingdom is for everybody. There's this new family of faith that's happening. What is it? Chapter 12? You want to know who my sister, brother, and mother are? They're the people who do the will of my father. You go back to chapter three and you get the stuff where John the Baptist is like, yeah, I don't think that just because you're descended from Abraham that that's the point and everything is good to go. God can raise up children any way he wants to. That theme is there and the fact that this line gets delivered, that he says this thing in Aramaic. Maybe I'm reading into it, but I kind of think I'm not. I think there's some weight to that as well. Well, the greater weight than the language is a substance of the words and what he's saying. This is the height of abandonment. This is the cruelest moment. Now you can imagine division in your family. Maybe you live with division in your family. I don't know. So I'm sorry. That's awful. For the most part, we've kept it together pretty well with our family. I suppose sometimes we irritate each other, but we get over it pretty quick and we've been pretty tight. My whole life still are, I suppose, but I feel it when there's any kind of enmity, any kind of tension, even little tension between me and any member of the family I grew up with, the family that I'm putting together now, it stings. The total breakage of a relationship between a son and his father is highly, highly tragic, but that alone doesn't properly communicate how massively tragic this is because it's not the disruption of a normal relationship between a father and a son. This is more like splitting the atom. This is breaking a thing that theoretically is unbreakable. This is harder than splitting the atom. It also unleashed more power, if you believe the biblical account, then splitting an atom would an echo through the centuries far greater than the first time we split the atom. But we're dividing something that is effectively, elementally, indivisible. I mean, hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. This is one God, but it's also three persons. So there's a strange messing with the fabric of reality with the relationship that defines all other relationships, not just between people, but like in the three to one contact sense, like all the relationships between everything. And that is being struck at the cross when God reveals his name. It's not like I am Ted. Tell them Ted sent you or even something that sounds weird and alien. Like I am Grefligel Schnitz and tell them that Grefligel Schnitz sent you. No, he says I am. He reveals his name as I am. He is essence. This is striking at the core of essence of truth, of order. Every ancient civilization had this concept. It was called Ma'at in Egyptian thought. The Chinese had a concept of this expressed in their notion of the mandate of heaven. The ancient Persians had a notion of this sense of rightness. I cannot remember it, the term for it, an old Persian, but it'll come to me when we're working through the book of Esther. Every ancient culture has a notion of this union, this unity, this tightness and the last words that Matthew is recording Jesus having said strikes at that most fundamental sense of order and rightness and union that even entirely pagan cultures could detect by looking at nature and observing and thinking about and reasoning through the abstract. Don't get me wrong, this is a big deal of what we're talking about here is a division between the greatest father and the greatest son ever. What we're talking about here is a division, a parting of ways, a sense of abandonment that goes all the way down to the core of what existence and essence and being is. We're going to talk more about that next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Armor Podcast. Let's do this again, sir.
