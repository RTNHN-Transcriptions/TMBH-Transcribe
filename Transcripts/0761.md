 Look, I'm not going to lie to you sometime today and or tomorrow. We're going to talk about the Holy Grail and King Arthur, medieval magic and legends, and it's going to be awesome. And I bet you know why we're going to, right? Because this is like one of those super famous legends from all of time that almost everybody's heard about because we're talking about Joseph of Eremathea. This is one of those names that comes up in all of the shows where some clever professor has to go and crack the historical code by looking at all of the secret symbols that were left behind by the Knights Templar so we can get to the secret McGuffin treasure faster than the evil treasure hunters who want to sell it to the Nazis. You know, that Joseph of Eremathea. He comes up right here in Matthew 27. We just got done with all of the stuff comparing the two sets of witnesses, the unreliable witnesses happen at the Kangaroo Court trial of Jesus before he goes to pilot and gets executed on the cross. And then we contrast that with witnesses who on paper don't look nearly as impressive, but they see things right and get it right. That being the centurion and his men and that being these faithful women who funded and put their necks on the line and we're willing to be seen in public, the vouching for Jesus, grieving over Jesus, being there in support of Jesus as he's on the cross. Very powerful stuff. Well, now Jesus is dead. So what happens to the body that gets us into the next little chunk of story here in Matthew 2757 and it goes like this, as evening approached, there came a rich man from Eremathea named Joseph who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Now as Joseph guy is a very big deal for the first thousand years of Christianity, he is revered as a saint by the Western Catholic Church, by the Eastern Orthodox Church, but he's a pretty popular guy and he's got a pretty great reputation. Even if we just go with what we know from the Bible, he's a guy who looks like he was a secret follower of Jesus against all odds. It looks like it would cost him something to go and do what he's done, not just money, but credibility. It looks like he's going to be so compelled by who Jesus was that he's going to go to Pilate, he's going to negotiate for the body of Jesus. It's a pretty big deal. There's even some Old Testament symbolism and follow through that might be present there. So that's a gigantic honor for him. Also, this Joseph of Eremathea guy is a dude who's willing to vouch. We've never inherited him up to this point, at least in the narrative, all the disciples who've been walking around with Jesus, they're nowhere to be found. They're not going to go claim the body. They don't know what to do. Maybe we could call that a gesture of faith on their parks. They're like, I don't worry about it. He's going to come back to life anyway. But Joseph of Eremathea is concerned with the right treatment of this body and holding Jesus in right regard and how Jesus would be buried would be part of his legacy. I mean, outside of Judea, outside of Jewish territory in general, I assume Galilee would follow the same ground rules. The Romans, if they crucified you, they'd just leave you out there to rot or throw your body in a heap. Remember, crucifixion was overwhelmingly used as a very public deterrent. And even after you die, we'll just put you on a stick so people can see what happens for a week or a month or six months or just until the crows get the best of you. The Romans made a point with this style of execution, but in order to maintain some sense of sanity and control and to order in Judea or Galilee, you couldn't do that. It just wouldn't work with Jewish sensibilities. You can't just throw bodies, even bodies of people we don't like. You can't just throw bodies everywhere. And so as a concession that is in keeping with the concessions, we see governors of this province, like Pontius Pilate, fumblingly trying to make as they try to appease these Jewish sensibilities as a concession. It looks like there's a provision for burial in some sort of public grave. But if you got crucified, the Romans would not go so far as to allow the dignity of you being buried in a family tomb or a family grave. Now I presume that Jesus family had one of those, I guess. I can't think of anywhere in the Bible that talks about that, nor history off the top of my head. But guess who doesn't know all the things? This guy. So it could be that Jesus family does have a tomb. And we do know about it or it is written down somewhere in history as I can't recall anything like that. But presumably he would. And so the dignified thing would be that whenever Jesus died, however, Jesus died because he was a member of this family and a pretty prominent one, you would bury him with his ancestors. He would sleep with his father's. Well, it's kind of an interesting thing that that's the language that's used for a proper burial throughout everything in the Bible up to this point. But who is Jesus father and what would it look like to sleep with his father's? Well, in this case, it's a little bit moot because he's immortal. He's coming back to life anyway. I mean, I guess he's not immortal because you can kill him. Then that did happen here. And I suppose part of what this passage we're looking at in Matthew 27 is an attempt to make it really clear. Like, now look, they had to do burial stuff. They had to treat his body. They had to figure out what they were going to do with his body. Jesus was very literally dead, not just faking it. This is important as even a point of evidence that Matthew is putting forward here. But I wonder, I want to go back to the Joseph of Verimathea thing because this guy is doing Jesus a solid and we've never even heard of him. He cares about Jesus reputation, his legacy. He thinks this brilliant, amazing man. I think Joseph had a higher view of Jesus even than what I just said. He thinks Jesus deserves a burial that will speak rightly to his legacy. And yeah, a lot of times when you're on the Twitters or the Facebooks and people are just ruthlessly bickering with each other about this thing or that thing. And all the different sides, they've got their thing where they always try to point the finger and be like, well, if you think that's so important, maybe you should do something. And then every now and then somebody's like, OK. And then everybody else is shut up because they actually did do something and they put their money where their mouth is. It's kind of what happens here with Joseph. Because moving forward in verse 58, it says, going to pilot, he asked for Jesus body and pilot ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and placed it in his own new tomb and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. Joseph of Verimathea wasn't just like that guy deserves a proper burial. And I'm going to shriek until some senator or something passes a bill that funds a really nice tomb for this gentleman. Nope. Joseph Verimathea doesn't ask anybody else to do anything. He just sees a problem, solves a problem on his own nickel and with his own space. This is the tomb that was cut for him to have the dignity of being able to buy rock space, tomb space. In Jerusalem or near Jerusalem. And this looks like this was his plan. My family legacy has been built through whatever successes I have had. I'm going to be buried here. Maybe he planned to move the bones of his ancestors to this place as well. That was a tradition that's certainly referenced throughout the Bible. And who's the first person who goes in this tomb? It's not anybody from Joseph of Verimathea's family. It's not anyone from Airamathea at all. It's Jesus of Nazareth, a crucified criminal according to the occupying Romans and anathema, heretic blasphemer according to the Jewish Sanhedrin, which as we'll talk about soon, Joseph Verimathea may have been a part of. And that person's body is going to be the first one in your tomb. This guy was making a statement and it's a kind of statement that's a little bit lost on us, but you can think of all kinds of things that you can go out and do. Right now, because stuff means stuff and you're very, very conversant in the world of meanings of this moment in life where you live, you know things you can go out and do that a thousand years from now. People might look back and be like, what? That didn't even matter. Like, what? Okay. You just set a phrase or you just like made a gesture or something who even cares. But you know right now what a big deal it is. Hopefully we're better understanding as we chat here, how big a deal, how much of a flag in the ground, how much of a public identification with Jesus it was to take this dramatic step. I mean, dude went to pilot. This is on the record kind of stuff. And we got to unpack a whole bunch more about this. And believe me, we're going to, but you were promised King Arthur and the Holy Grail and medieval legends. Panchas pilot and Joseph Verimathea are two of the super interesting mystery characters surrounding the life of Jesus, that same impulse that makes the reader curious about how the people who crucified him reacted. I mean, think about it. If that's not in there for Matthew, wouldn't you be like, I wonder what the people who were there thought of this? When all of that's going down. Well, Matthew speaks to it a little bit, but history has wondered for millennia. How did it affect Panchas pilot? What about his wife? How did it affect Joseph Verimathea? What happens is over time, you get some Bible fan fiction that gets written. And that Bible fan fiction gives way to medieval fan fiction. And as all of these centuries of fan fiction gets scribbled down, somehow Joseph Verimathea becomes connected to the cup that Jesus supposedly drank out of at the last supper, the one he used to commission to institute communion. And the legend evolves to the point where it is believed by some that Joseph Verimathea was also at the cross and that he caught some of the blood of Jesus in that cup. See, because it's like this cup is a new coming in my blood. You see what they're doing there? Again, this is all apocryphal, not from the Bible, but then these legends go even further to say that the cup became the most powerful relic, the most powerful artifact from the time of Jesus and that it had the ability to grant eternal life, which is coming from the time of Jesus. And that it had the ability to grant eternal life, which is kind of what we see happening with the night who guards the grail in that Indiana Jones movie. And it's kind of a literalization of the thing that in the grandest, truest spiritual sense, what Jesus did and was symbolized in the last supper and the cross and all that. What happened there? It's held out as actually giving eternal life. Well, I think there's some gold to be mined about tracing that legend a little bit and we're going to do so tomorrow. I also think there's more gold to be mined just looking at the character and motivations of Joseph Verimathea, where he's from, how we got here and the really unique circumstances of Jesus burial. Reminder, we're wrapping up this series on the book of Matthew on the last day of this year. That's going to be it. And then we're going to take a weekend and then January 2nd, we start our new thing, which is going to be one day to cover each individual book of the Bible. I hope it proves to be a super hyper useful series that pulls together a whole bunch of seemingly disparate threads about the Bible. And even though we can't maybe get the whole thing in every single detail in our hip pocket after the first quarter of next year, I think we can make some good headway on it. I think we can get to gist. I think we can get the big picture in a way that maybe we never have before spread out on the table. We're going to chip away at it every day. It is going to be a blast. I'd be so grateful if you would roll with me into the next series and do that with me as well. I'd be even more grateful if you'd invite somebody to come along. I think it could be a great conversation piece or something to work through with somebody else. More on Jesus burial, Joseph Veramythia and the legend of the Holy Grail, manana. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
