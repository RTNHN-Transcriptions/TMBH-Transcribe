 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and if you've ever been doing the thing where you're carrying out with your day as normal and then you look at some stupid mess that's just been staring at you for months or maybe even a year and today's the day. You've just had enough and the mess is getting cleaned up right now. It's a dirty desk drawer. There's some cluster of stuff that you got in the corner of the laundry room that just never gets cleaned up or most likely it's your garage. You just finally got out of control because all of the projects and it's the family dumping ground for everything. You're like, I'm just done. I'm not doing any of the other things. All I'm doing right now is purging this mess and I will not rest until this is resolved and then you just go to town on the thing and everything feels better because it needed to be purged. Well, obviously we've been in Matthew chapter 21 looking at a situation just like that. Jesus rolls into Jerusalem. It's a big fancy town. Everything is coming to a head in terms of the story and the tension between him and his enemies, the religious leaders who want to kill him. He comes into town and everybody's super happy to see him and they throw their clothes down so that his muddy donkey can walk right over the top of it. It's kind of weird. It's a donkey and not like a conquering war horse charger sort of deal, but yeah. Okay, great. Cool. It's nice to have you here. Everybody's excited. They're yelling messianic things at him and really sees hold of that goodwill that he's got. He marches right over to the temple and starts flipping over tables and yelling things about this being his father's house and not a den of Robert's specifically goes like this. Matthew 21 verse 12. Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. It's written. He said to him, my house will be called a house of prayer, but you're making it a den of robbers today was the day lady. He wasn't messing around anymore. You know what it's like when things have gone on too long, brother, it's time to fix this thing. And so he fixes it immediately. Like first thing. And as we've been talking about the last few days, you wonder what the response would be to something like this. I mean, surely there were people who are outsiders of the whole thing and they're tourists and Jerusalem. They don't know anything about the religious stuff or anything. I don't care about any of that. And they're like, whoa, it's weird that like these, they get into some weird Jew fights around here, but like, I don't know, whatever. I don't really understand your religion or whatever. That's just something that you all do. And it's really pretty town anyway. So sorry that I got in the way of your fight. Maybe other people are there and they're like, Oh my goodness, this is exactly what's wrong with this place is ungovernable. Everything's a religious fight. But surely the majority of the original audience were like, uh, yeah, that got pretty weird there for a long time. And the text gives us evidence of that because there's no backlash to this cleansing of the temple. This purge. Everybody seems really happy about it. In fact, they come to him all the more because of this. So it makes me wonder if maybe most of the original audience would have looked at this behavior and been like, wow, not only is that something that we can tolerate you doing, but it's kind of your duty to do that. If you're going to roll in here, like the Messiah and it'd be weird if you didn't feel some sort of affinity toward the house of God, the father, and it'd be weird if you didn't do something about a problem like this. Well, Jesus certainly did something about the problem like that. But I also wonder if the original audience would have been thinking about other times that the temple had been cleansed, I think there are a few such stories that people would have been thinking about. I mean, back then, a lot of the heroes that the kids would have grown up being excited about were Bible heroes, Old Testament heroes, and every character would be either a cautionary tale or a moral example of how things ought to be. And there are a couple of kings from the era of the kings in the Old Testament who really got things right in the midst of a sea of other disasters. And part of what these two kings got right, King Hezekiah and King Josiah, is that they came to understand that stuff was getting screwy at the temple and they did something about it. And so we are going to look at those stories real quick like right now. The first one is in 2 Chronicles 29. And there's so much here. I can't read it all to you quickly. If you don't remember a ton of things about this part of the Old Testament, that's okay. But first and second kings and first and second chronicles have a lot of overlap. And both sets of books follow a similar narrative rhythm. You've got awful king, awful king who did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord. And every now and then you get a king who is good and did what is right in the eyes of the Lord and is often associated with his father David. So if a king is good, you'll see that language like, oh, and this king ruled this way and did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as his father David had done. I mean, not literally father. These are people distantly descended at this point. And so that rhythm runs throughout and you get these little accountings of what all of the creeps did and usually it involves participating in local ancient Near Eastern idolatry, particularly by erecting ashara poles, which is the place of worship that could be thrown up in simple locations. You could put a national pole on top of the hill or wherever it was easy cheap idolatry, I guess is a good way to put it. Or the other type of idolatry that is even more scary that was endemic to the Canaanite population was that of the worship of the God Molek. Sometimes depicted as looking like a bowl. Sometimes you'll see the sculptures of Molek from back in the day of this bold man character holding his hands out and what you would put in those hands if you were a worshipper of Molek was one of your kids. You'd put that kid in there and then they'd crank up a fire underneath those hands and people would murder their children. They're living children right there to the God Molek as a way to satisfy his wrath or whatever the belief was. And so this is denounced pretty heavily throughout kings and chronicles as being a terribly bad idea. And this is one of those places where I'm going to go out and go out on a limb here morally and take the risk of making a pronouncement and say, I'm with the Bible on this one. I think it was a super bad idea for people to sacrifice their babies to Molek. And so I understand why when the rare good king comes along, the author of chronicles and kings would be so excited to point that out. But what seems to have happened is that these people had lost their way. They'd lost their connectedness with their God, the God who made a deal with them through Abraham and a deal with them through Moses. You remember those two deals? The deal with Abraham was Abraham, I'm going to make a people group out of you and you're going to be a great nation unconditionally. And no matter what you do, even if you're an idiot, I'm going to make you into this great nation and you're going to be blessed and the peoples of the earth are going to be blessed through you. And then a little bit later in a less easy to extrapolate promise that God makes to Moses, he says, all right, you're going to be my people. I'm going to be your God. And if you disobey me, this is very conditional. I'm going to punish you, but everybody will still see by the nature of the punishment and your behavior that I am the one true God. If you obey me, I'm going to bless you. And likewise, everybody's going to see that by nature of their behavior and that blessing, their God is the one true God. And that motif, as we've discussed, those two promises, well, really the third promise being the one to David about the kingdom and the king that we talk about every week with Jesus, those three promises create the narrative arc of the Old Testament, but the narrative arc of the Old Testament in kings and chronicles and in the era of the judges, it's entirely connected to that second covenant, the deal with Moses, where you get things right, things go great. If you get things wrong, things go very, very badly. And these two books reinforce that heavily. That's probably more background than you needed, but now we're up to speed. So in second Chronicles 29, you've got a refreshing break from chapter after chapter of lousy king. And this good and likable king who we're going to be looking at, I'm now going to say tomorrow is Hezekiah. Hezekiah comes on the scene. His predecessors had made a mess of things or sacrificed some babies to molak over fire and his predecessors are engaging in other horrible, detestable practices. Whether you believe in God or think there's a God behind any of this or not, I think all of us can agree that stuff they were doing is really screwed up. And Hezekiah comes along and he's like, yeah, now it's my time to be in charge. And we have got to clean up this garage right now. And then additionally tomorrow, we're going to look at second Kings 23 and the story of a king named Josiah who became king at a time where the whole law and covenant, the old deal with God, it was lost. The actual book of the laws that God had given to his people had been so disregarded that it got benched, it just got thrown in the back of a room somewhere and they did some renovations. And somebody's like, I think, I think this is like from God, we should look at it. And King Josiah was like, I would be very interested in taking a look at that. And then he again is going to decide, I want you to clean out the garage. I'm going to give you a little bit more about those stories tomorrow and talk about how they tie back into what we're seeing going on with Jesus in Matthew 21 with his metaphorical cleaning of the garage. And then finally, we're going to think a little bit about whether you and I get to go flip over tables or whether that is a behavior that is reserved for the one who's given to judge everybody and whose judgments are always 100% correct. I think it's going to be a hoot. Hey, thanks everybody. Supports the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. I really appreciate you and you are the reason that we get to do this.
