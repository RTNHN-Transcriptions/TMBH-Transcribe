 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. You know, the news media cycle works right. Like the way they dance in perfect step in time with the politicians, then you can just you can buy truth. That's how things have been for a very long time. It's not a new phenomenon propaganda and controlling the flow of ideas and the spectrum of acceptable thought is something that people who want to maintain their grip on power have had to employ for a very long time. And it's not even just one ideology or one political party as a monopoly on that. Generally speaking, there are ideologies that are a little more given to it than others, but over the course of history, pretty much everybody's tried their hand on it. It's pretty much gross every time it happens and truth gets run through the ringer. And especially when it's the other team doing it, isn't it so incredibly simple to see the stunt that they're pulling? You can look at it and say, oh my goodness, that doesn't square with science or reason or logic. That doesn't square with morality. All the things that you're having your mouthpieces say rationally, it all implodes on itself. How could anybody believe this? And you can just see through it easily. In fairness, I think it's a lot harder for me to see it when people I presuppositionally agree with do the same thing in favor of ideas I might like. It's harder to detect because it feels better going down. But I guarantee you, every single one of you listening to this can point to at least one thing, probably dozens of things that have happened in your lifetime where you watched everybody, all the talking heads, all the media types, all of maybe even the social media types and whatever party was sitting in power. I bet you can picture a time where they all came together and they were like, hey, this is how things are right here. And you looked at it and you were like, that doesn't make any sense though. But they just said it louder and angrier. And then they tried to make you do things and play along and made it really clear that unless you want to be on the outside of society looking in, you better think and do and say these things, even if we can't at all defend the logic of it. And maybe you looked at it and you thought, for a while, am I taking crazy pills here? What's going on? But the more you thought about it, the more you were like, no, this just isn't truthful. This doesn't make sense. This isn't honest. And I can't believe the degree of hubris and self righteousness that is coming along with these obvious falsehoods that are being spouted here. But here's the crazy thing about that. When you find yourself detecting that kind of societal behavior, your brain can go to this place where you're like, I don't need like blood over this. I don't need vast amounts of punishment, but I do need acknowledgement that that was false because eventually these narratives, they always break. Truth has a way of winning out over time, but that's not what you get. Is it you don't get the catharsis of the people who most peddled the dishonesty coming out and apologizing to everyone like, sorry, I got carried away. I didn't tell the truth. I know that wasn't totally honest. But it was for everybody's good or it's just what we had to do in order to win. And these are important times. No, you don't get that. What you can said is the memory hole and everybody's just sort of expected to forget and you move on to usually the next lie. And it's an exhausting cycle. It's a cycle that causes intellectual despair. It causes loss of heart. And I know a lot of people feel that in the world right now and have for the last five, 10, 20 years. It's a very frustrating aspect that we all have to live through in terms of the relationship between truth and the state. But here's something crazy. We're getting something like this, a ridiculous mockery of the truth and absurd, bully, like violent field day that flies in the face of reality, the evidence, the facts as we look at Matthew 27 and the behavior of the people who are preparing to execute Jesus and who are mocking him. The things that they are doing to him, the punishment that is being dished out is not justified. We got 26 other chapters of Matthew, the things he's accused of that are illegal and that are executable in terms of their scope. He didn't do those things. The things that people are saying he said, he didn't really say those things. And this whole thing has been an obvious mockery of justice. So then that brings us to that place of cynicism, that knee jerk response. We all have because of how many times we've been jerked around by state sponsored dishonesty, political party sponsored dishonesty, media sponsored dishonesty, and not all the media is dishonest. But come on. Now we got this moment here where we're like, I know how this ends. We're going to use violence and suppression to just rewrite the truth and that's going to be the end of it. It'll get memory hold. This guy is going to get killed. It's going to be an absolute farce, but we'll be on to the next outrage tomorrow and that next outrage will be used to make us forget the last outrage so that nothing ever gets done about all of these things. And nobody'll ever answer for anything. And that'll just be that. But here's what's crazy. The Bible holds this one out is working out differently. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament suggest that this time around it isn't going to get memory hold. It isn't going to be the kind of thing where this goes unchecked that there is a vindication and that the vindication is going to be very, very obvious. We almost never get this in real life. And even if we do, you almost never get the acknowledgement from the side that was involved in the dishonesty and the injustice that they were wantonly dishonest. But there's a bunch of stuff that we're going to look at in just a second that suggests that that is how this one is going to play out in Matthew 27. They're just having a lovely time. These executioners making a joke out of Jesus in ways we talked about yesterday. And in verse 27, it says, and the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. They twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. Hey, okay. Of the Jews, they said, that's six different points of mockery I've seen so far than the next verses they spit on him. They took a staff struck him on the head. And that doesn't even count all the mockery that have already happened here in the last chapter. So getting punched and told to prophesy about it stupid stuff like this. But like we were talking about yesterday, every one of these mockeries flips around and turns out to be an accidental statement of truth. Remember when they're punching Jesus and they're like, Hey, prophesy that who hit you? Even there, the very next thing that Matthew tells us is a fulfilled prophecy of Jesus from just an hour or so earlier. The King Leregalia, all of that actually in a mocking way points to the reality of his kingship. When they say, Hey, old king of the Jews, they're kind of saying what they should be saying to him. And when they mockingly bend the knee to him, they are actually assuming the correct posture before the true king. They're just doing it in a mocking way. Again, if we're talking about the way things play out now with the old say things that are ludicrous, punish people for not thinking and then memory hold the whole thing when the truth comes out technique that gets used constantly in modern politics, modern media, modern social media, we should expect no satisfaction here. We should expect no vindication, no resolution. But here we're going to get it because what do you do with the fact that he came back to life? What do you do with the fact that hundreds of people saw it? We get that vindication in that the disciples will not let the religious leadership memory hold this thing. Right after Matthew, the next book chronologically is the book of Acts and more than once in the early going of the book of Acts, Peter, who completely wilted in the face of pressure and abandoned Jesus after boasting that he wouldn't suddenly empowered by the Holy Spirit just won't shut his mouth and is willing to go to war with anyone. He won't let the religious leaders memory hold what just happened here. He's pinning it on them. Acts 2 36 talking in front of a huge crowd of people in Jerusalem in the marketplace. He says, therefore, let all Israel be assured of this. God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ. What's crazy is in that environment, people aren't like, no, we're going to kill you too. And said it says they were cut to the heart and thousands of people became followers of Jesus that very day. A little bit later on in chapter four of the book of Acts, Peter and John are doing overtly redemptive things, saying things that are only entirely true and they get arrested by the temple guard, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the religious leaders there have a none of it. They're going to bring them in and let them know effectively what they're telling them is you're going to need to memory hold this because it is memory hold and you are wrong and you're going to have to shut up about this thing. They're going to use violence and they're going to use force as is still human tradition and practice to this very day to make these words to make this truth go away about the reality of Jesus and who did what. But Peter and John filled with the Holy Spirit will have none of it. Acts 4 eight rulers and elders of the people. They said, if we're being called to account today because of an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed, then know this you and all the people of Israel, it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead that this man stands before you healed. And in the midst of all of this messaging and the midst of all of this refusing to have this thing memory hold, the vindication is evident to the masses and the religious leadership cannot get it back under control. Christianity straight up wins over the false religiosity of these failed religious leaders who have initiated a perverted version of Judaism that isn't looking for the Messiah. That doesn't recognize the Messiah when the Messiah comes. Remember, Christ wasn't there to initiate a new religion. The follow through of the religion is the arrival of the Messiah and the establishment of the kingdom and all of this mockery and this fake kneeling and all of this farce of a trial and this farce of an execution. Jesus is going to be vindicated in front of everybody for all of it, even here in the short term. He's going to come back to life. His enemies aren't going to be able to produce a body to prove that he didn't. There are going to be a ton of witnesses who are willing to go on record in front of anybody to say he did and he is. And Jesus doesn't just come back to life for a minute. We're going to see that he's there for a really long time and that lots of people, both people who initially liked him and people who didn't couldn't help but admit this actually happened as weird as it sounds. It actually happened. Then on top of that, these disciples Jesus had been investing in under the influence, the power, the presence of the Holy Spirit. They won't let the thing be memory hold either. So in the short term, we see all kinds of evidence of this vindication happening. This will not be memory hold and made to go away. But also we haven't even considered the long term stuff yet. What does this vindication look like over time? Well, again, both the old and the New Testament suggest that there is a comprehensive vindication that is going to come. Not just one where people begrudgingly are like, well, I just won't say anything and we'll just let it slide and buy my silence. I'm tacitly acknowledging, I guess, you know, we were wrong to mock. We were wrong on that one. No, there is a grand vindication that the Bible holds out as still being a part of the deal. That sets this apart from other political incidents historically where powerful people play very fast and loose with the truth. And next time around, we're going to look at the stuff in both the old and the New Testament that talks about this grander vindication that you're supposed to keep in the back of your mind while you're watching the height of mockery and what seems like really the low point in this whole farce of a situation Jesus is enduring right now. More on that, manana. And Matt is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
