 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. And one of the things that you see happen from time to time in any kind of programming or movies, any kind of series is that things can go afoul off camera in between seasons, heck, even in between the shooting of scenes and people who were involved with the project suddenly aren't involved with the project anymore or can't be for various reasons. And so these characters sometimes they'll just go away. They'll vanish like they had to make the what was the characters name, Alex Kamal character go away from the expanse in between two seasons and they didn't even bring him back to shoot anything with them. So they took some old footage that they had from the last season, I think, and then just made him go away or in Cobra Kai, that new Netflix series where they go back and revisit the karate kid stuff. I guess it's not new anymore. I mean, we're into what season three maybe there was a fairly significant character named Aisha who just went away from one season to the next. I don't know if she'll maybe be back someday. And there was really kind of no acknowledgement. She was just on screen a lot and factored in and then she just wasn't on screen anymore. The great and beloved Edgar Wright, master director of visual editorial comedy who absolutely crushed it with all of the hot fuzz and Sean of the dead kind of stuff. He was the original director of Ant-Man and then something went afoul. I don't know what and never really looked into it. Somebody else finished up Ant-Man. He just went away. People go away part way through these stories, part way through these projects. It happens from time to time. And I'm always kind of curious like, well, where'd you go? How to work out what happened to that person? I would have liked to have followed that storyline in the case of the characters I'm talking about. Did they move away? What happened? Did they get hurt? Are they okay? What went down? And that's kind of what we run into with Peter, not just in Matthew as we talked about the last few days. I mean, he just goes off screen out into the darkness to weep bitterly at the end of Matthew 26. And then we pivot to Judas's death at the beginning of 27. And then we're on toward the crucifixion and the resurrection. What happens after that? It's done. Matthew doesn't close the story out with Peter and we speculated about different reasons that might be. But then over the last couple of days, I was like, Hey, I mean, come on, there's more about Peter. Let's just go see what Mark and Luke and John do with him. And sure enough, there's a lot more there. They leave us in a different place. They flesh out the story a little bit in different ways. And then we get into the book of Acts. Now, look, I know that there are a bunch of you who hang out here and you have been around this since forever. Like you went to Sunday school. Your parents were church people. They got you little cartoon books with all the characters and you're like, you know, this stuff like the back of your hand. I also know there are a whole bunch of people here who are like, this story is interesting and compelling. I'm not looking to really sign up for anything right now, but it's been fun getting to know these things that have informed culture so much and that have proven themselves to be like the most timeless story of all the stories and I'm having fun. But hey, to that part of the crowd, maybe you don't know every single detail. It's not all old hat to you. And into that person who hasn't spent a bunch of time around the Bible in general and doesn't know all these stories and characters like the back of your hand, that's totally cool. And I see you. I'm super glad that you are in and that you're part of this thing with me. And from time to time, I just don't mean to be patronizing, but I want to pause and acknowledge that some of these details might not be known to everybody. And here's one of those details. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, these all tell roughly the same story of Jesus for four different audiences, saying it in four different ways meant to accentuate four different theological aspects of his story. And we've been looking at one of those in Matthew. One of those four gospel accounts, Luke has a sequel. The sequel to the book of Luke is called acts as we talked about a couple of days ago. Luke was a doctor who traveled with the apostle Paul. Paul is one of the two main characters of the sequel to the story of Jesus in the book of Luke. That is the book of Acts. Paul and Peter are the two characters that we follow the most. Luke was pals with Paul, not pals with Peter. And I don't think like Luke was enemy. I don't think they like fought or argued or gossiped about each other when they stayed up late with their friends and couldn't sleep and talked about their lives and their social circles. I think Luke was probably real nice to Peter and Peter is probably real nice to Luke. They just didn't overlap a ton. So in the first half of the book of Acts, we get a whole lot of Peter from sort of an outsider's perspective with Luke. Luke did research to learn what happened after Jesus died and was resurrected. But in the second half of the book of Acts, Luke is talking about a dear friend and traveling companion. He's talking about the apostle Paul. So when acts, it would just be weird and unnatural if we didn't get more stuff on Peter. Surely acts must round out the story of what happened with that guy because it seems like he's the most prominent disciple. According to all four gospels, it seems like it's personality wise. He's most likely to actually go and do something and take big chances and risks to move forward the whole kingdom thing that it looks like he was commissioned to do. And so when we get into the sequel that picks up right where Matthew leaves off, right where Luke leaves off, that is the book of Acts, it opens with Jesus actually still being on the screen. It picks up with all the stuff that happens once they get up to Galilee. Now, at the end of Matthew, we get just a little snapshot of this, a little commissioning, but at the beginning of Acts, we get Jesus recommissioning them all again. Now later on, we're going to take a quick look at some of the stuff that happens in this sequel when we're done with all of Matthew and the Jesus stuff to round out our project there. We have to see what happens next. So we're going to look at acts a little bit, but you'll be happy to know that Peter is on screen right from the beginning. They're up in Galilee together. Jesus sends to the right hand of the father, just like he predicted that he would in Matthew 26 and the trial with Caiaphas. And then the disciples pick a replacement for Judas who is unavailable right now. And Peter's name appears right there at the beginning of the list of who the disciples were who were present right after everything went down, along with the women who had followed Jesus around so faithfully, they're all there. So in verse 15, it says, in those days, Peter stood up among the believers, a group numbering about 120 said. The scripture has to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas who served as a guide for those who arrested Jesus. He was one of our number and he shared in this ministry. So then they do go ahead and they pick a replacement for Judas. And pretty clearly Peter seems to be at the helm there. He's charging ahead, make decisions, do stuff that's in keeping with his personality. So anybody who goes from Matthew to the book of Acts will be quickly reassured. All right. Restoration of Peter, Peter pulling it together. He's not still out there crying. All of that happened off camera, but he's doing okay. And it's nice to have that character back who just kind of disappeared. Well, after that, you've got a gigantic moment at something that's called the day of Pentecost. If you don't know what that is yet, that's all right. The quick version is it's the day that Jesus promised delivery of the Holy Spirit occurs. The Holy Spirit, God, the Spirit shows up and things happen. And I'm trying to overly simplify here to keep it succinct. We'll look at all of that later on. Well, then what we see over the next few chapters is Peter's brashness finally paying off and all the things that Jesus said were going to happen back in Matthew 10 when he sent them on that open world quest. And I was like, here is what's going to happen when you go talk about me right now. Here's going to happen when you go talk about me a little later. That's what we're getting to here in the book of Acts. And then here's what it's going to be like when people go and talk about me like way, way later. So we see that stuff play out. The religious leaders, they're still mad about things that we'll look at more closely later. Peter is very brave. Peter suffers physical abuse. Peter starts traveling around and witnessing miraculous work of God and the clarifying miraculous work of God about how you move forward. Are we doing Judaism? Are we doing Christianity? Are they the same thing? I mean, it's really the same questions people would have been asking and all the way back at the Sermon on the Mount. We have a religion. It seems like this is related to that. How does it work? Peter advances that theme of Jesus that Jesus was the fulfillment of all of that stuff. And there's confusion in the book of Acts amongst Jewish Christians in particular. Like how do we hold all this in common? Our religious leaders did kill him, but we do think he was a Messiah and we saw him. He came back to life. So we're pretty sure that that ain't normal. So we're in, we're just not sure exactly what we do or how we initiate new people or whether all of the exact same cultural and cleanliness rules apply. What do we do? And so in Acts 15, there's a get together in Jerusalem a few years after all the stuff that we're reading about in Matthew happened where they got to sort out those kinds of questions. Well, Paul is there. Paul never met Jesus, but there's an account in the first half of the book of Acts of him having an encounter with the risen Jesus on the road up to Damascus to go and persecute Christians hurt or maybe kill some people who had the wrong opinion about who Jesus was. He was the enforcer, the thug who did the bidding of the religious leadership in hopes of someday he would be in charge of the religious leadership. So he's on his way to Damascus. He has his whole life changed. He becomes a follower of Jesus and really important things start happening. And the Jerusalem council happens in chapter 15, both Peter and Paul are there. And it looks like there's a little bit of disagreement about whose job is what moving forward. And there are several hints throughout the New Testament, at least a couple that make you kind of wonder if Peter and Paul are heading for a collision, but they never do. Instead, according to tradition, and what we know from all kinds of sources, they both in one way or another end up in Rome and they both play a role in developing and establishing that church in Rome. If you talk to an Eastern Orthodox Christian, they would say Peter and Paul established the church in Rome. If you talk to a Western Catholic Christian, they would say Peter established the church in Rome and Paul was also there and played some roles. Those points of emphasis change a little bit just depending on theological understanding and preference and what tradition you're coming from. I'm having fun. I want to keep working through the rest of how things shook out with Peter as best as we know it. So I'm just going to take one more day to really land the plane here on what happened with this very important character, this very empathetic, sympathetic character who has been our POV character as we've worked through the book of Matthew. He's the guy we can relate to. He's the guy who we scratch our head along with. He's the guy who we're glad is getting yelled at instead of us when he's wrong and screwing things up, even though we would have made the exact same mistakes or even stupider ones. He's the one we're kind of jealous of because he was willing to go and do bigger, crazier, bolder things than we would have been willing to do in the situation. And he's the one who we kind of look up to because even for all of the mistakes, he was able to see things and get things that I genuinely believe I probably would have been on the wrong side of if I had been there and witnessed all of this stuff as well. So I will miss Peter. We're going to spend one more day with him rounding this out and then we're going to be back to Matthew 2728, the home stretch of the book in general. All right. More on the rest of the story of Peter next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
