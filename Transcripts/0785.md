 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. No matter what you believe about what we're talking about yesterday, that being the approximate date and the circumstances of the writing of the book of Matthew, what we can agree on is that definitely the manuscript evidence behind the English version that we are reading here without flinching supports Matthew having insinuated himself into the story. Not young Matthew, old Matthew who's writing this weighs in a little bit right here in Matthew 28 verse 15 at the end of his account of the guards and their shenanigans with the religious leaders and the religious leaders agreeing to run cover for them if there are any questions that come down from Pontius Pilate. You know what? I didn't read the whole thing yesterday. I'm just going to read it real quick and then I'll get to know what we're in talking about today. While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. That's verse 11 to Matthew 28. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money telling them, you're just saying, his disciples came during the night and stole them away while we were asleep. If this report gets to the governor, we'll satisfy him and keep you out of trouble. So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed and the story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. But here's one of the questions I want to tackle today. Has it though? Is that where it came from? Do we know that? Well, to what extent do we know anything this far back? It's not the same kind of knowing when you've got a Jillian living witnesses with living memory. But yeah, we can cobble together a pretty good case. And one of the smoking gun bits of evidence that we get for this pressure, this rumor, this report of the guards that circulated so widely comes to us from the mid-second century AD. There's a church father named Justin Martyr. I always insist on pointing this out. That was not his given name. The martyr part, it turns out they added after he died. So I guess before that, he was Justin the philosopher. He styled himself as a philosopher. He's a kid who was born. He missed John the apostle just barely. They nearly overlapped and there would have been heavy overlap with, it would have been like Clement of Rome would have overlapped with both of those lives. So we're talking like one degree of separation, Kevin Bacon game here between Justin Martyr and John, who was with Jesus. So this guy is very, very early in the game. Justin Martyr grew up in Syria. I think it was a Samaritan actually, ethnically. And the reason I'm struggling to remember all the details is because he moved around a lot and he lived in Rome. He lived in Ephesus. And it was during that time in Ephesus, after which he'd already gone through a few religious conversions before landing on a belief that Jesus is the Messiah. It's during that time in Ephesus that Justin reports meeting a Jewish man, a Jewish thinker named Trifo. Now a lot of people historically have gone back and they've tried to figure out like, who's this Trifo guy? Oh, we've got a Jewish rabbi by this name. It's kind of similar. My theory is having not read this for a while, but I read it for school back in the day. My theory is that the dialogue that Justin writes down and holds out as being one between he and Trifo is probably one that is an amalgamation of a whole bunch of different conversations he had with different Jewish thinkers in his travels along the way. Maybe he met a guy named Trifo and they talked for a while in Ephesus. Justin here, he's not writing Bible. He's writing a literary work in the fashion of the great Athenian philosophers. He modeled himself after them in terms of appearance. He physically presents himself like Plato or Aristotle or Socrates in terms of style. And his behavior was like that as well. Let's go around and look to engage with people in a conversation instead of being eyes down on the phone all the time. This is one of those guys who his eyes up and just willing to go anytime. And so he gives us his account of a dialogue with Trifo. It is testy, homies. There's not a friendly little chit chat. We're not doing the, Hey guys, let's try to do internet civility here, which I'm for. I really am for that. I don't know, a different time, different level of contestation or maybe this was just one of those things that was so hot a topic that in its context, this would have been considered a tame a conversation. Once again, the work is called a dialogue with Trifo. I think it's got a much bigger, longer bloated name, but you can go and get this in full form, you know, PDF off the internet anywhere you go and look if you want to power through it. It'll take a minute to power through it. There's a lot to read here. What you're going to see as you do so is well, early formation of Christian thought and doctrine, the Bible isn't bound up into one book and being circulated yet. I am firmly convinced that Justin Martyr would have carried and read and deeply understood Matthew's account that you and I are looking at as well right now. But the pressures you and I feel as we read the book of Matthew, I think are very different than the pressures that a guy like Justin was feeling in the first century. Like even though as I've lamented a couple of times on this channel, there's been this weird little uptick in anti-Semitic language, especially from a couple of communities and I look, I'm not going to spell it out, but I do not understand what the weird racial obsession is toward Jewish people, but it's weird. Our compass spins a little bit on this topic right now, but it shouldn't even be a topic. Racism is stupid and for idiots and there's a special brand of racism that gets directed at Jews from all over the place culturally and it's dumb. But I don't think that that deeply informs the conversation we're having. Like I don't think we just sit around and like, wow, what does this mean for anti-Semitism though? It's not one of the big categories that is a cultural pressure that's always on our mind as we interpret the text. It's pretty clear that all the saints that are in the Catholic churches, the big sculptures, like they're all Jews, all the disciples that is, they're all Jews. The guy in the crucifix, he's a Jew, Mary's, she's a Jew. So I think everybody kind of gets that some of the people who were ethnically Jewish, but part of the Jewish leadership, a roundly condemned by Jesus in Matthew 23, we see it all over the place, but not like Jews. Okay. All of that said, you go back to the second century AD and think about the dynamic. Rome is still in charge and Rome as a government, as a persecuting force, as a law enforcement occupying agency, that is not a targeted instrument. It is a big, blunt, ugly instrument that you just want pointed at somebody else whenever possible. Well, now the Jews are going to be looking at the Christians after the first few decades of Christianity and they're going to be like, what the heck? Now you're making it look like we're not presenting united front. That makes us look divided and that could cause us problems with Rome. It looks like some of the persecutions that were intended for Christians got Jews swept up in it and vice versa very early on after the time of Jesus. And further, it divides up the amount of power and influence that the Jewish leadership is going to have at court in Rome and at court with the local Roman governor in Caesarea. Plus, you still got this idea lingering that the fate of everything is hinging on the proper behavior of all of the people of the nation of the ethnicity. God will bless us again. If we get our act together and we follow every one of these little rules, that's my best attempt to give the benefit of the doubt to the religious leadership. So unsurprisingly, the big debate and you know what these are in our day and age here, ladies, a bunch of things, we're all just comes down to this. Are you here or are you here? The big debate here is that Jesus come back to life or did he not? And it was an issue of massive contention. And the reality of the matter is that the Jewish leadership, they were the first persecutors of Christians. Rome came later, hamstrung the religious leadership and they weren't able to persecute Christians much more. But that is still all shaking out generationally at the time that this dialogue with Trifo that we get from Justin Martyr is unfolding. So it's testy to a degree of intensity and to a degree of specificity that is going to be very, very foreign to us. But Matthew, you recall, said that these lies that came from the guards and the religious leadership that they were being circulated to this day and Justin Martyr seems to be indicating the same. I wouldn't even say seems. Now this language, it's harsh. It sounds a lot like what Peter says to the religious leadership when they're having them flogged and everything for continuing to preach Jesus early on in the book of Acts. Put this in its proper historical context. Thank you for indulging my disclaimer. Here we go. Chapter 108 of a dialogue with Trifo. This is Justin Martyr's character speaking here. And though all the men of your nation knew the incidents in the life of Jonah and though Christ said amongst you that he would give the sign of Jonah, exhorting you to repent of your wicked deeds at least after he rose again from the dead and to mourn before God as did the Ninevites in order that your nation and city might not be taken or destroyed. His previous point was about Jesus talking about the sign of Jonah. So he's not just coming out of the blue here referencing that stuff we've looked at in Matthew a lot. But I remember I said he read Matthew a whole bunch. I mean, it seems like, I mean, come on, you see what I'm getting at. So even though he said this stuff about the sign of Jonah and you should have listened so that your nation and city might not be taken and destroyed as they have been destroyed, yet you not only have not repented after you learned that he rose from the dead, but as I said before, you have sent chosen and ordained men throughout all the world to proclaim that a godless and lawless heresy had sprung from one Jesus, a Galilean deceiver whom we crucified, but his disciples stole him by night from the tomb where he was laid when unfastened from the cross and now deceive men by asserting that he is risen from the dead and descended to heaven. Moreover, you accuse him of having taught those godless lawless and unholy doctrines, which you mentioned to the condemnation of those who confess him to be Christ and a teacher from and son of God. Besides this, even when your city is captured and your land ravaged, you do not repent, but dare to utter imprecations on him and all who believe in him. Quick side note, you might be starting to think, dang, that's, that's really, really harsh. But remember, this is an underdog speaking truth to power here, yet in spite of that, listen to this final thing that Justin Martyr says, because I think it's just cool and it's reflective of the values of the kingdom. Yet we do not hate you or those who by your means have conceived such prejudices against us, but we pray that even now all of you may repent and obtain mercy from God, the compassionate and long-suffering father of all. Justin Martyr went on to teach in Rome, where he gathered a school to himself a lot like the philosophers he styled himself after in Athens did centuries earlier. And much like one of those philosophers, Socrates, his ideas ran afoul of the spirit of the age during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, and he got ratted out for having the wrong ideas and teaching the wrong ideas was ultimately convicted and his sentence was that he had to pay homage, he had to prostrate himself before the Roman gods, he wouldn't do it. And so he and his students were beheaded, in the sense the story of Justin Martyr. But for our purposes, it's pretty clear that we have extra biblical confirmation that what Matthew is saying here is true. Even the latest imaginable date for the authorship of Matthew would mean that this statement is true if this same lie that Justin is accusing tripho and the religious leadership of proliferating is still in circulation, then we can say verifiably that Matthew's comments here in Matthew 2815 about this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day, then we can say conclusively that was indeed true.
