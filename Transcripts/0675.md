 and he talked about different subjects so that then I could be like, now there we go, without any context whatsoever, I've got it ranked. Now I know what he cares about because how many times he mentioned things. And so I did it. I went through all of the Gospels. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the four books of the Bible, to tell the story of Jesus. And I added it all up. I had a little tally sheet, I remember it was on yellow, legal paper, it took me a long time. But I had these categories, and the categories had to get a little more complex as I went along, and some of the things he said kind of counted for two or three categories even at once. What I'm saying is my methodology, yeah, it wasn't perfect. It was honest. I don't think I had a bias going into it. I just really want to know, right? So I get the whole thing done. And when all the tallies were added up, I was a bit surprised. Maybe now I wouldn't be surprised by it. But back then I was like, whoa, that's not how I thought Christianity was. It's very interesting. I would have guessed, wait, no, no, no, that's not fun. I'm going to let you guess wherever you are working out in your full body unitard, sweating vigorously, probably mostly in the lower back. Am I right? I just want you to start shrieking out the things that you think Jesus cares about. So for example, maybe you're at the club right now and you're on that treadmill, and you think Jesus talked most about sex. I just want you to shriek that word as loud as you can, maybe even while making eye contact with somebody. No, not while making eye contact. Just shriek that or whatever you think the answer is. But based on my upbringing, which I think was really good, my parents were great about all that stuff, I think I would have thought sex would be right there real close to the top. Like purity stuff, things that the Bible does talk about and God definitely has commands about that are very important. But I would have thought it was that, or maybe swears, those that came up a lot. As a kid, like what words were on the good list and what words were on the George Carlin forbidden list, maybe it would be like entertainment, garbage in, garbage out, consume the bad stuff, then you do the bad stuff. Maybe it'd be something that's like, voteable, some kind of political thing that'd be overlapped there. Maybe it would be something really good. Even I think I would have thought that just love your neighbor might be real close to the top and indeed, it is close to the top. But none of those things were at the top of the list. This is what I found when I added up all of my tallies. The number one thing that Jesus cared about based on how often he talked about it. And now it is dehumanizing. I feel bad for using that pronoun, but it's his father. Jesus talked about his father and his relationship with his father and obedience to his father, more than anything else in a non scientific trip through the gospels that I took. Now maybe you're like, ah, that sounds fishy. I'm going to go Google to stuff. Yeah, right here. I got somebody that says it's actually this other thing. Look, I don't know. They had their methodology. I had mine. What I found is that just all over everything, undergooting almost every teaching and every remark and every interaction with a person positive or even confrontational is this relationship with his father. And so part of why Matthew is, I think, so effective as a bridge between the Old Testament and the New Testament, as you've seen as we've been going through this, is that, I mean, really, what needs to happen here? We need to bridge the gap between the character and work and teachings of Jesus, the kingdom stuff about Jesus and the God of the Old Testament who keeps indicating in so many of his interactions through the prophets and with his people. Like, hey, there is redemption coming. A thing is coming. There is a Messiah that's going to happen. There's somebody's going to sit on the throne of David and reign forever and I'll establish this kingdom. And so it makes sense then that Matthew is writing to Jewish people would be really interested in being like, look at the relationship between Jesus and his father. And so it makes sense that he would highlight that really, really hard and point out that this was a central priority of Jesus. It also makes sense from Jesus perspective to be like, look, I'm not just another rogue religious claimant who has an over inflated sense of ego and I'm here to do the work of God. And by the way, the work of God happens to include me getting all of your money and all of your political loyalty and you being willing to take up swords and go kill people and even die for me. Also, I'm going to need to marry probably not one or two of your daughters or wives, but like dozens of them because that's what cult leaders do. But no, it wasn't like that at all. He clearly wanted to point out, like, I'm not here for world stuff. My values are not of this kingdom. They're the kingdom of my father and all of the redemptive thread of the narrative of history, the law and the prophets and everything that came before, they get all points to me because my relationship, my intimate connection with the father, that's the truest, realist relationship ever. I and the father are one. You've seen the son, you've seen the father, we've seen that kind of language all over the place. But also what we've seen throughout Matthew is that there's an obedience on the part of God in the flesh to God the father who reigns eternal. And that's a very difficult thing to parse out. And if that's a little bit confusing, the Trinity stuff, the How is Jesus God and God, thing, like, hey, that's been a difficult thing for humans to wrap their brains around forever. So don't feel bad if that's a little bit challenging or confusing. But what is inarguable is that Jesus is held out as the Christ, the Son of God, God in the flesh, but also one who is an obedience to the will of God the father. So then back to my silly little list, it makes sense then that this would be something that would be sneaky, something that would get a whole bunch of tally marks on that because if Jesus does talk about something that involves human behavior or even a parable or something that maybe could be voteable or any of those topics that we would think it would seem like in the back of our brains would be really important to Jesus or like the kingdom or love, love your neighbor. Anytime he's talking about that, where's the authority coming from for him to say that? Well, his own authority is self-evident because of who he is and what he does and the lack of limitations on him. But even more so, I think the authority is from God on high. It's from God the father. And so you get a lot of double counts on my little tally sheet because everything seems to point back to that relationship with the father. Well, in Matthew 26, we get one of those little moments where if you're not doing the tally sheet and you're just kind of buzzing through it, you might be like, Oh, well, this is a part where he's being very human. He's talking about his emotions as he faces death. But no, buried right there in it, not even buried like sitting right there front and center, but easily missed is that theme again of his relationship with the father. So Matthew 26, 36, it says, then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Getsemane and he said to them, sit here while I go over there and pray. And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me. And as we discussed, they weren't really into that. They were super sleepy because of the triptychon and their system because they had a big Passover holiday meal and they're just drowsy and their eyes were heavy. And so they're not enough. And then Jesus going a little farther, he fell on its face to the ground and he prayed, my father, if it's possible, may this cup be taken from me, yet not as I will, but as you will, where do you put the tally mark there? If you're keeping track of things that Jesus really prioritized and valued, maybe you've got one that's like, I'd prefer not to die if possible. Okay, it gets one tally there. Maybe you've got one that's like prayer, prayer was very important to Jesus. You got a tally there. But if your tally sheet includes submission to the will of the father prioritizing relationship to the father, you got to put a tally there as well. And indeed, all of the other things here are undergirded by that relationship once again. And this idea of I'm on board with your will, I'm going to sink or swim with it. I'm with you the whole way to the very end, even when it hurts kind of mentality from Jesus toward his father is not like it's a one off. It is all over the place. It's a particularly pronounced theme over in John. There's only flip over there. John for 34. My food said Jesus is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. And then you flip over like literally one page, it's into it one lousy page to five 30 in John, it says, by myself, I can do nothing. I judge only as I hear and my judgment is just for I seek not to please myself, but him who sent me. I don't know if I made this clear, but that was Jesus talking right there as well. We turn one more page over to six 38 for I have come down from heaven not to do my will, but to do the will of him who sent me. We turn a couple more pages to like I'm completely new to the different part of the Bible. That was not a couple of pages. That was all the way to the end of acts. It's like it's my first day and I've never read this thing before. I'm embarrassed in front of all of you. John 1431, I'm done stalling. It says, but the world must learn that I love the father and that I do exactly what my father has commanded me. And then you turn one more page 15 10. He says, if you obey my commands, you will remain in my love just as I have obeyed my father's commands and remain in his love. Then you flip over a little bit further and I'm not going to read it all, but John 17 where he prays for future believers, he's like, I pray that there'll be one as you and I are one. That follows the exact same theme. Now we go the other way in Matthew back toward the sermon on the mount. Matthew 721. And if some of you right now are like, wow, that internet Bible man knows the Bible so well, he just knows all this. Then I have fooled you because I don't know all of this. There's a little thing that's right next to the verse we're looking at in Matthew 26 that basically is like, here's all the stuff where Jesus says that he and the father are one and that he does whatever the father wants. And so I just looked at that and then I keep going back and checking it and then I just turn to the page where it tells me to go because whoever made my Bible is smart and they actually are the ones who know it. So the point is, don't think that this like fancy zip all over the Bible stuff is something that only Bible geniuses can do. I am not a Bible genius. I am cheating. And you can do this work on your own and figure out all of this on your own as well. Matthew 721, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, we'll enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven. Turn back one more page. The loyalty oath to God the father that is called the Lord's prayer. Jesus says, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Again, Jesus is saying that the ideal way to pray is as an active submission to the father. I think Jesus top priority was his father, the relationship with the father, the establishment of his father's kingdom, the will of his father, unity with the father, and all of the other things that we read flow out of that unity, flow out of that relationship, flow out of that acknowledgement of the authority of the father. And Jesus absolute insistence on being completely aligned with that all the way even to the painful, violent end. Well, not the total end, but the end of that expression of his life on the cross. And I think it is very interesting than when he was under huge duress here in Matthew chapter 26. What he says is like basically, I mean, it would obviously be more fun if I didn't get brutally tortured and murdered in front of a bunch of people. But even if that's a situation like even under those circumstances, your will is top priority. You learn a lot about somebody when you put him under that kind of duress and we learn a lot about Jesus right there as well. Of course, he doesn't want to be tortured and killed in front of everybody, but the priority of that relationship and obedience of the will of his father, that Trump's even that horrible, horrible thing.
