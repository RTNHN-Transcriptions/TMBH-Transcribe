 Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and it's very rare that I sit here and restart the recording several times. Normally, I just read the text and think about it a little bit. I think it's something kind of a funny thing that I want to talk about. The kind of ties in and then we turn on the mic and I don't know, it just goes to plan. I want it to feel like an actual conversation that we're having like actual civilized people. I don't want it to feel too fancy. My ex is all polished and perfect because it's not and I'm not. And one of the goals of this whole thing is to make sure everybody who's listening knows and you can do this for yourself. You're smart. You can read a book. You can think this through. This is meant to be understood. You don't actually need me though. It's cool that we get to hang out together. But this one has been really hard and it's been very difficult all week because we're talking about a super challenging subject. We're talking about slavery in the ancient world. We're talking about slavery in more modern times and we're talking about what the Bible says about slavery. Look, there's no way around it. The Bible Old Testament and New just assumes that slavery is a thing, that it's part of life and in that the Bible was very accurate. It was a part of life. There was no escaping it. Pretty much no one in the ancient world, the classical world, the Bronze Age, Iron Age, anywhere in there is like, maybe we shouldn't do slavery at all. Maybe you better if we just canceled that. In some ways, slavery provided a function in society for people who otherwise in less developed time would have been off the bottom rung and just left for dead. And then a lot of other ways, it was exactly what you think of slavery as being. The awful, torturous, violent, stripping people of dignity and rights. But the Bible, it never really comes out and has like whole books that are like, we got to get rid of slavery. Christians later looked at this stuff and figured out like, man, the values of the kingdom mean that slavery doesn't make a lot of sense. We're going to make this go away and Christians led the charge on that. And it's difficult even to assume some of the more flippant goof around town that I like to assume from time to time. So we take the edge off of this thing. Here's where I think I want to go. I want to try and make some sense today with the remaining, whatever we got, seven minutes here of why Jesus and the New Testament in general seems to be using slavery as a negative example to illustrate a positive point. Paul at the beginning of Romans introduces himself as a slave of Christ Jesus over in 1 Corinthians 6 something something, maybe it's the last verse of the chapter actually. Paul is talking about like bad behavior that was happening in the Corinthian church and he reminds them like, hey, you were bought with a price. That slave language. He's reminding the Corinthian church you were bought back from death and bondage and you were bought into this freedom in Christ. You were made freed men. So which one is it, Paul? Are you a slave to Jesus? And does that include all of the connotations of that? Or are you set free? Were you bought into this, this new freedom? Well, what it looks like the New Testament is actually saying is both the New Testament describes all human beings being in this state of bondage to sin and death to the world system that goes nowhere and ends in destruction and then along comes Christ in his kingdom. And in this truest real kingdom, you're not a slave to death and sin and that destiny anymore. Those debts are paid. It's going to be bought back as we're going to see here at the end of Matthew with like the whole cross and resurrection thing. And the idea then is that the kingdom citizen is bought at a price, but there's no indication in the New Testament that the kingdom citizen is bought at a price. And it's like, and now you shall be your own master, go and make your own religion and do your own thing. No, clearly you're bought at a price by the work of Christ on the cross. And then the idea is that now the kingdom citizen is well to use Paul's language in the household of a new master, quite literally a slave to the king, to Christ Jesus. Well that sounds horrible on some levels. It sounds beautiful on other levels, but I think to get to the heart of why in passages like Matthew 24, Jesus is using this master servant or master slave language to illustrate a point. I think we just got to think about why slavery is actually wrong. And I would do this thing in my college classes back in the day is history 201. It was the first half of American history and we get to the stuff about the transatlantic slave trade. And I would hand out little excerpts from stuff that slaves said or that even slavers wrote down and we get all these different perspectives and they were all equally horrifying, violent, awful, bloody, terrible, heartbreaking stuff. And I'd have each student read one little bit to the rest of the class and people were in tears. It was always an emotional bonding moment for us as a class as we came together to just agree this is horrible and we denounce it on every level. But then it would always kind of pivot from this was so bad and we feel some kind of darkness and even guilt over it to kind of a little bit of moral chest thumping about how much better we were than these dumb idiots who lived before us and how much like the Roman and Greek masters, we are more morally and socially enlightened and entitled just intrinsically by nature of who we are and our birth. I would find that we had this impulse to go right back to the very foundational pride that made slavery happen in the first place because the truth is we aren't actually better than the people who came before us. They bled and died and sacrificed so much to deal with these horrible moral ills of the past and God give us the courage to deal with the horrible moral ills of today that one day our descendants might say the same thing about us and the courageous things we had to do for justice and making things right as well. But just about the moment that my classes would get to the virtue signaling moral chest thumping thing, I would always ask a question and say, all right, who thinks slavery is wrong universally, just absolutely morally wrong and every single person would raise their hands like, obviously it's completely wrong. Okay. And then I would ask a follow up question and this is where things would get difficult. The follow up question was why? Some students push back on even the question like I get wrong to even ask that slavery is so obviously evil. If you can't just say slavery is evil, you can't say anything is evil. Okay. Hey, I'm just asking a question. If it's so easy to explain why it's so obviously evil, then it shouldn't be a threatening question. It should be an easy one to answer and I throw it out. Well, it always went the same way. Early on the whole class would say some version of it's wrong because we all know it's wrong now and it became evident to everybody and we voted and the majority figured it out and the consensus is that slavery is bad. What if people came to a point some day where they had a slight majority who were like, I think slavery is actually maybe a good idea again. What if we do a little bit more of that? Would it then become morally right? Is it in some way more than a product of moral consensus or opinions? And then students would have to start looking for something else and inevitably they would move toward having to begin to formulate arguments about the nature of a person and the value of a person. No, that's why it's wrong. Like even if everybody said slavery is right, I'd still know slavery is wrong because people are important. People are valuable. People aren't cattle. You can't do that to a person. It's not how things work. And they were right. The Christian understanding from the Bible is that people are made in the image of God. They have tremendous value. They are peers. We are peers with each other. It doesn't make sense for anybody to buy, sell, trade, breed another person. You don't know another person. We're made the same stuff. We are the same thing. You can't do it. It's wrong. It's a supreme violation, a supreme debasement of another person, supreme hubris and that idea at least in a secular sense that we all own our own bodies is the foundation of morality. Even morality for things like what you do about the climate or what you do about the rivers and keeping things clean. Why does it matter? Well, it matters because there are other people and they also own their own body and you can't do things like that to them. Why can't you steal from people? Because other people own the product of their labor. You can't do that. Why can't you just kill somebody? Because you can't replace that body. You can't give life back to someone once you've taken it. It's a very simple starting point for public morality. Then you look at any time in history where an individual or a government gets things way atrociously wrong. It always starts with a violation of that. And inevitably, the governments that go off the rails always get to a point morally where they believe that you don't own your body. Their organization owns your body. And if at any point their organization does some paperwork and file some things and figures out that they're going to need the product of your labor. They're going to need you to say certain words. They're going to need you to not say certain words. They're going to need you to bleed for them, die for them, or even kill you. Well, they did the paperwork. They feel justified in doing so. And great atrocities occur as a result. So where's all this going? Whether we like it or not, what Jesus seems to be teaching throughout the Book of Matthew and what the whole New Testament seems to be teaching is that humans are going to be a slave to something because we are finite. We are broken. We live for only a short time. We die. We're very limited in our faculties, our ability to control our environment and the larger world around us, let alone the more obscure, powerful, abstract things way beyond our reach. And because of that, there seems to be an option. You can be a slave to the world system which spirals toward death, destruction, chaos, forgottenness, meaninglessness, or you can be a slave to a benevolent king who's the maker of everything and who is infinitely just and infinitely good and who servants whose slaves are also called son and daughter and heir. They're given full participation and ownership in this king's household, in this king's kingdom. That contrast is an important extension of the whole kingdom citizenry versus world citizenry theme that we're seeing throughout the New Testament. And so every time an analogy involving slavery comes up in the teachings of Christ and his parables. And we neuter the language down to servant because we don't want people to feel bad about the transatlantic slave trade. We don't want to trigger people and remind them in this awful chapter. We don't want to make Jesus look like a monster. Every time we choose the word servant over slave, I think we're actually kind of diminishing the meaning of the text. The reality is what Paul says at the beginning of Romans chapter one, that being that Paul was bought for a price out of slavery to death, chaos, destruction and nothingness by the true king of kings by his work on the cross and in the resurrection. That's what the Bible teaches and that he didn't just become liberated and set free a Ronan to make his own decisions and wander as a man of the West, but he became a bond servant within the household of the king. It is very difficult for us to appreciate the beauty and the forward thinkingness of this language because of our current political conversations and the last couple hundred years of history. And it's okay that that's cluttered up. But the reality is if we want to read the text for what it's saying, we have to do this exercise. We have to grapple with why Jesus insists on continuing to use this Greek word, do loss, literally slave in these parables and in these illustrations when he's talking about stuff that corresponds with us. Tomorrow, we're going to take the work we've done over the last three days and we're going to apply that to this parable of Jesus at the end of Matthew chapter 24 that we've been flirting with for the last week or so here. I think this is a very important moment in the history of our relationship to move slowly and make sure we are understanding the implications and the larger context here. I feel we have done the work and I look forward to goofing around a little bit more tomorrow. I've missed that. All right. That is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.  illegitimate while you are watching this video or this book, The Project Real
