 is a mom or dad or teacher somebody in authority city down and give you really long talk about what it is you were getting wrong and partway through the talk is a kid or maybe even as someone older than a kid you're like okay I get it I thank you yeah I know all right okay yep yep yep yep you're right I shouldn't have yep okay thanks bye okay I think I think but the longer they keep going and the more you're like okay I think I get it the more you realize no now they're on to another completely separate thing and yeah I guess I did screw that up too and oh no okay I thought I got that and that was probably it but no now that you keep talking dad yep I guess I screwed that thing up to and you realize that sometimes these omnibus lectures that you get from a parent that cover multiple multiple different points of failure they feel really really bad but when it's all over you're like yeah I'm kind of glad that we just got all of that over with right now but when you're a parent and you give one of those more extensive lectures you realize something you didn't get as a kid and that is this when I give one of those multifaceted talking twos to my kids it's because all of the points relate and they want to think about it and just single little isolated things like I shouldn't have said that to my sister or yeah I should have done the thing you said but what I'm trying to point out is like there's a pattern here there's a whole batch of things that I want us to be working on because all of these things are demonstrative of the same underlying thing that is the character project that we need to be chipping away at right now kiddo and so I'm sure likewise in Matthew chapter 23 the Pharisees are like okay yeah okay yeah I know you don't like okay flak yep too long with tassels okay I think I get it okay thanks bye thanks but each new thing that Jesus tags on is further demonstrative of what has broken and as we talked about yesterday what this fractured failed system that they have gradually produced that doesn't make fruit is all about so let's just review here what the points of this omnibus talking to are that Jesus has directed toward the Pharisees in the presence of all of these people on Passover week in the vicinity of the temple and so all right what do we got here thing number one don't do what the Pharisees do for they don't practice what they preach okay so accusation number one is hypocrisy but maybe it's better to just view accusation number one is being more like the thesis statement for the rest of this omnibus talking to that Jesus is directing at them and the rest of the things that Jesus is gonna say here could maybe be considered supporting evidences or supporting points to demonstrate that indeed they don't practice what they preach I'm not sure that's the best read on the outline but it's one way to think of it either way point number one they don't practice what they preach hypocrisy point number two they burden people down well that's not their job their job is to connect people with God and they're doing the exact opposite and once people are burdened down they seem to like the suffering of the people in their care and so they don't do anything to number three alleviate that burden so hypocrisy burdened people down legalism rules religious stuff that it's not Bible not God and they don't do anything to help problem number four comes up here in verse five everything they do is done for men to see so now we get into their motives they're doing this because they want credit from other people they do stuff with their religious garments that are meant to draw attention to themselves and all of the stuff that we get here in verses five six and seven should be viewed as supporting the point that he's making the whole things of fraud it's for men to see so where they're talking about the outfits or the flactories or whether you're talking about the greetings in public or whether you're talking about people calling them rabbi which we'll get into more here in just a minute it's all for their evidence of their hypocrisy of their self-love of their pride of their lack of concern for others so this multifaceted talking to it's getting pretty heavy here and I'm sure at all of these points they're like all right we get it but no not really because Jesus is saying like all the things you do point to the exact same flaws flow from the exact same flaws so I'm sure for that that's all very uncomfortable but the discomfort continues verse eight Matthew 23 but you're not to be called rabbi for you have only one master and you're all brothers and don't call anyone on earth father for you have one father and he's in heaven nor are you to be called teacher for you have one teacher the Christ the greatest among you will be your servant for whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted so much there revisiting the term rabbi as promised a second ago the notion of a rabbi is being somebody who goes around like it was what am I saying fiddler on the roof the fiddler on the roof notion of rabbi that's a little bit later development we're still a few decades before the idea of a rabbi being a really impressive teacher who people would go to for wisdom and interpretation we're getting there at this point in history late in the life of Christ but after 70 ad the with the temple going away now Judaism kind of goes franchise it goes out and the individual local leaders become more important because you don't have that headquartered leadership and that leadership thought body like the Sanhedrin functioning in the same way that it did before the destruction of the temple at the hands of the Romans and 70 ad so what we think of as rabbi is probably a little bit anachronistic compared to what it would have meant here from what I can gather it looks like the term rabbi at the time of Christ was a title of respect that meant graced or great one and wouldn't necessarily have been just directed at the kind of person who's a teacher or a scholar in the way we might think of it now so that's the case Jesus is pushing back on these guys wanting these honorific titles and really reveling in that and thinking that there may be entitled to a title that is more meant for fancy people in society but somehow trying to elevate their religious leadership thing to like oh no no we're fancy people in society to where the upper crest also could be read that way but he goes on to say you have only one master and you are all brothers that's very interesting as well as brothers and fathers familial language and the midst of a bit of a rebuke is all kind of reminiscent of what happened at the end of Matthew chapter 12 where Jesus' mother and family members are outside and it looks like Mary doesn't even come into where Jesus is teaching and instead send somebody in to be like hey go get them it looks like they've come to collect Jesus who they think is misguided or missing the point or need some kind of help or redirection from them and I know that for some people theologically it's pretty offensive to suggest that Mary was not fully in step with Jesus and what he was doing at all points I'm not trying to make a theological statement directed at groups that very very highly and uniquely revere Mary I'm just trying to go with what the text says and how Jesus responds to her and Jesus brothers coming to collect him and you were calling 1247 it says somebody told Jesus hey your mother and brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you and then Jesus replied to him who's my mother who are my brothers pointing to his disciples he said here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother so Jesus is building this new family of faith he's been talking about it a lot hinting at it a lot hinting at the idea that the old family of faith that one that is born out of Abraham is not salvific it's not automatic that there's something newer and bigger that Abraham thing that even individual family was supposed to point to this bigger truer realer family of faith and so here rabbi seems to be something that he's likening to like an honorific title between brothers like before the term master evolved into mister and so people would call each other master and master like master Kenobi and master Skywalker and it looks like Jesus is pushing back on this uppity mutually affirming use of honorific titles amongst the religious leadership and he's using that to get into this idea of family and then he goes on to say and don't call anyone on earth father for you have one father and he's in heaven now here again it's like the second time in two minutes I know that it is very possible that this text or the way we're looking at the text could step on some toes and that's really not my intention but obviously a huge percentage like well like half of Christianity uses the term father to refer to a religious leader at a local church or in a certain religious hierarchy and then a whole bunch of other Christians citing passages like this would be like I don't think that's the right title that we should probably use there I don't really have time or interest in getting into the entire debate other than to say it looks like what is happening here is that Jesus is saying you guys are trying to claim titles that are not appropriately yours you're misunderstanding the notions of this new family of faith and the best and it looks like at least from this text and exclusive application of the term father in a spiritual title sense as if it's directed at the one true father capital F the father and there's only one and he is in heaven there's only one god man and I'm pretty sure he does and dress like that nor are you to be called teacher for you have one capital T teacher the Christ so in just a couple of sentences Jesus has taken a shot at the title rabbi kind of likening it to master and saying well don't do that because you're all brothers indicating that this collegiality should go far beyond the religious ruling upper crust and that anyone who's a part of this family of faith should probably be called brother but then the father title seems to come with a prohibition at least that's how it looks like in this text because while you have many brothers and they're all worthy of that title by merit of being included in the new family of faith the family of faith only has one father capital F and so that title should be reserved for him again total respect for people who are part of a different tradition and might read that differently just trying to relay what it looks like is being said in the text immediately and then thirdly he takes a pop at the word teacher I don't think anybody treats this as a universal prohibition on the notion of teacher but the ultimate title of teacher capital T he very boldly here saying should be ascribed to the Christ and then he wraps all of that up harkening back to language that he used when James and John's mom came along was like yeah come my kids sit your right hand can they have your watch when you are dead and Jesus responded to that with that repeated motif that we've seen throughout Matthew about the first being last the last being first and all of that being and keeping with the example of Christ he said son of man didn't come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many so what we're seeing here is a contrast between the Pharisees and kingdom values what we're seeing here is even the use of honorific titles and how the methods of employment for those honorific titles and Pharisee circles were not producing fruit and were not in keeping with kingdom values but the way they were using them stuff means stuff everybody knew what it meant was instead exclusive and self-exalting in the opposite of kingdom values if you are vicariously feeling that long talking to exhaustion that you got when your parents needed straighten you out on something know that we are about 33% done we've got more to hear from Jesus and this is 22 chapters of stuff that is built up that needs to be addressed and we are going to wade through all of it amigos a mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast I appreciate you let's do it again soon you
