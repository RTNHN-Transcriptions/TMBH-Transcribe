 Have you ever experienced one of those social situations, maybe at the holidays or somewhere else that I melt down at a party or something that just happens really, really public and everything is fine or like fine in the way we do fine. We just keep it together and avoid confrontation. And then somebody just says some stuff. Maybe the stuff made sense. Maybe it doesn't make sense. But there's like, boom, here it is, both barrels. Here's everything. This is how I'm feeling about the stuff. We were just watching Spider-Man 2 last night where Harry James Franco's character is real mad at Toby Maguire's Spider-Man character. He doesn't know these Spider-Man yet. I know this party and Harry gets all licked up and he starts slapping him like a dude just slapping another dude at a fancy party for fancy socialites and everyone's gasping and quiet and clutching their drinks because it's so awkward and there's just no pretending it didn't happen. I think that's the kind of situation we're running into here at the end of Matthew 23. This is so public. There's no going back on this. Everybody's listening to it. I'm guessing there were literally gasps and guffaws at Jesus' remarks. Maybe he's going along and these woes that he's proclaiming at the religious leaders, Pharisees, the teachers of the law. Maybe in people's brains they're like, well, if you interpreted it this way, they could still move forward together. Your football fan and you're down 38 points with 13 minutes ago in the fourth. You're like, okay, pick six here and then an on-site kick. It's just at some point you have to admit this is a fantasy. This is not going to work out. I think the crowd probably along the way was thinking, I don't know that there's a road map for really putting this back together. But then when Jesus finishes the last of his seven woes after home stretching it with you guys are vessels for consuming food or beverage that look good on the outside but inside it's filthy and disgusting, you guys are whitewashed tombs. You look pretty on the outside but on the inside you just have death. And also speaking of tombs, you religious leaders decorate the tombs and honor and venerate the dead prophets who your tradition is responsible for killing and who if you had been there you would have helped kill as well. And people just like them. You're about to kill here in a few minutes. So those are pretty bad. Maybe the most optimistic person out there in the crowd who just really likes people to get along was like, well, it could maybe still be construed as possibly. And then verse 33 happens of Matthew 23. Jesus says, you snakes, you brood of vipers. How will you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore, I'm sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you'll kill and crucify others. You'll flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth from the blood of the righteous able to the blood of Zechariah son of Barakiah whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. I tell you the truth. All this will come upon this generation. And then at that moment with that last line, I picture inside the brains of those few people who were still holding out hope that this could maybe be hugged out somehow. I think there was probably some sort of metaphorical downward slide whistle. No, no, I think we're done here. I don't think these guys are going to work it out. If you've been hanging around with me while we've been working through the book of Matthew, then that initial language from verse 23, you snakes, you brood of vipers that probably popped for you. But say, hey, I turned right to it. I was getting excited when that happens. In Matthew chapter three, when we fast forward from the nativity business with Herod and the Magi and all of that, we go from the end of chapter two and it's early in Jesus life to the beginning of chapter three. And now we're all grown up and Jesus is becoming a public thing. And John the Baptist is out baptizing right at the beginning. We don't really know how the religious leaders are going to respond to John the Baptist and the revival that's happening out in the desert and to this Messiah who has promised to come. Or maybe a few rumblings floating around, but nobody really knows what to make of that. And so from a purely chronological perspective, when we flip to the first few verses of chapter three for the first time, it's like, well, isn't there already a religion here? What are the religious leaders think about this? Maybe they'll get on board. Maybe this will be some kind of unifying thing. And then verse seven, but when he, John the Baptist saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, drum roll, please, maybe it's going to work out. Maybe they're going to be allies and they're going to pull the cart in the same direction with their powers combined. Quote, you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming wrath. Oh, downward slide whistle again. Okay. Produce fruit and keeping with repentance and don't think you can say to yourselves, we have Abraham as our father and okay. Then he goes into the stuff where he calls out their over inflated sense of ethnicity being their assurance or claim to connectedness with God. And then John the Baptist goes on to point to this other one is coming after him. That turns out to be Jesus and then Jesus shows up and then the baptism happens and the Trinity is there and it's amazing and it's a really encouraging and exciting passage, but it's like poetry. It rhymes here at the end of Matthew and at the beginning of Matthew with this language about you snakes, you brood of vipers. The bad guys are introduced to the story in chapter three. They go quiet in response to that rebuke, but you'll notice the crowds aren't recorded as being like, Hey, hold on. Those are our Pharisees and Sadducees. I wouldn't say they're like a brood of vipers. No, they're just like, okay, I'm just going to stay in line and keep getting baptized because that might smack of truth just a little bit. And then we get to the end here and you'll notice that you're running the mill every day Jerusalemite is not running into the mix to be like, Whoa, whoa, Jesus of Nazareth. Like, I like you and I like the donkey thing that you did and flipping over the tables. That part was cool. But how dare you criticize these religious leaders of ours. They are precious, precious, precious and they are above any kind of criticism. No, everybody's just kind of sitting there and you almost get the impression that maybe a whole bunch of them are like, well, kind of, yeah. But as Jesus just invoking that language again, because it was catchy and he really likes symmetry or is there some larger point? Well, I'm asking the question. So I think there's some larger point. I think he's trying to draw on the words of John the Baptist, who's come up very recently in their conversations. Remember, John the Baptist still casts a long shadow over this whole conversation. And in the middle of 21, Jesus is in the temple. This is just like one a day, two days earlier, not much. And the religious leaders, they show up and they're like, wow, by what authority you're doing these things. And then Jesus is like, I'm going to bring up a name you don't like very much because it makes you feel real and comfortable because you got a track record. This is all implicit and I'm reading this all back into it. And I'm like, I'm going to bring this name up. And I hope it makes you squirm. And so then Jesus flips around and it's like, I got a question for you since you're fixing to kill me. Let's talk about somebody else recently killed by people of a similar ilk and persuasion to you. John the Baptist, where did his baptism, all that business come from? Was it from heaven or from men? And you'll recall they had to do a little parlay off to the side because they're like, Oh, okay. We're a little vulnerable on this point. He brought up something that is not the best look for us. We have an agreed upon company policy that we are moving on from that. We want to look forward and talk about the future. We're not really here to talk about the past anymore. And so they come back and they're like, we don't know. And she's like, okay, well, neither will I tell you about what authority I'm doing these things. And then we jump over here and we get a reference right back to John the Baptist. Why? Because their ilk killed him. Now I know it was Herod who did that. That's very clearly recorded in Matthew and external sources like Josephus agreed that it was a political leader who did this. But all of these political decisions are happening hand in hand between the religious leadership and the pseudo secular leadership. And even if Herod was the guy who swung the sword, the Pharisees and Sadducees had long ago pronounced the sentence that John the Baptist was a problem. And if they'd wanted him out of jail, they probably could have pulled the levers to get that accomplished. But clearly they didn't have any motivation to do that. And they didn't like how much the people had enthusiasm for John the Baptist. So Jesus is pivoting into the final death strike here to say, look, you guys are murderers of the prophets of God. That's your routine. That's your actual legacy. This is who you are. You murder the message. You murder the people. You murder and mutilate history to try to deceive about these things. But Jesus is saying the emperor has no clothes. I am pointing at you. I am pointing out there are no clothes. I'm pointing out that this whole thing is a giant fraud that isn't just a nuisance. We should tolerate. It is a problem worthy of the full condemnation of God and you're the physical representatives of it standing right here, behaving in the same way that everyone who's come before you in this tradition have behaved. And just in case anyone might imagine that you're suddenly reformed and that you don't kill the prophets and resist the work of God, the intention of God for his people. Look at John the Baptist. You guys got blood on your hands. So much with that, you can't even acknowledge where he came from or where his authority came from. So to review today, we have hell and vipers and blood on hands and condemned and reference to a beheaded guy and fighting. This kind of a lot. I get that. I totally get that. I know this is like the 15th time I've said it while we've worked our way through the seemingly endless material that is Matthew chapter 23. But it's so important to understand that Jesus and the Pharisees didn't just get a little bit sideways because they couldn't agree on a couple of points about finer religious theological details. The text quoting the words of Christ holds this out as being a completely adversarial relationship where Jesus is trying to fulfill the redemptive work of God and the Pharisees are trying to stop it. That is how the text is holding it out. So there should be no surprise that tension like this is going to come all the way to the forefront. And at this point, we've sorted through most of it, but we've got a bit to go. Thanks for spending time with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this.
