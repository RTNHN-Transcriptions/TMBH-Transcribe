 The other day I was hanging out with my mom and dad who I love very, very much and who I enjoy taking in stories with. We had a couple hours to kill and I was like, hey, have you guys seen this WandaVision show? It was an interesting series, imperfect, but very interesting in terms of what they did. They were like, no. So I put the thing on and it set the hook. It was really fun for them. This series, it's a little twin, pixie, a little bit losty in that part of the fun of watching the series is just trying to figure out what the heck is going on. It's told in such a way that it is just a loose end fast. There's a million questions floating around after each episode. And it was difficult for me watching through the first four episodes with my mom and dad to even keep straight what they knew and what they didn't know as first-time viewers because I'd watched the whole thing twice already. So as they're asking questions in my mind, I'm like, oh, wait a second. Oh, that's right. That hasn't been revealed yet. You're just about in the next episode to figure out how all of these things fit together. And so there was something really good about watching that show with them because it helped me overcome my see it all at once bias that you only get after you've been through it a couple times. And because I was watching it through them and kind of vicariously seeing it through their eyes, I was able to pick up a lot more. Whoa, that really is an incredible moment kind of moments as these reveals happened. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 16, we have got a passage here in 1613 through 20 that is often completely overshadowed by the controversy that goes along with it. And we talked about the controversy that goes along with it. We dealt with that at length in the last few episodes, but the controversy is not what Matthew has in view. It's not what the passage is about. What the passage is about is taking a whole bunch of things that are really profound. Questions that have been floating out there from previous episodes, cliffhangers, stuff that there would have been fan theories about and Easter egg videos about. And now finally, in just one gigantic important revelatory moment, so many of those outstanding questions are getting answered. And I don't want to walk away from this profound passage, having thrown most of our energy at the later historical controversies about the structure of church and the authority behind different brands of church. I don't want to walk away from it having that be the last thing we think about. So in light of that, today we are going big picture here considering everything we've seen in the book of Matthew so far to try to appreciate what the readers would have known at this moment, what they would have not known at this moment, and how big these reveals are here in verses 13 through 20. Here once again is the passage. When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, who do people say the Son of Man is? They replied, some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. And what about you? He asked, who do you say I am? And Simon Peter answered, you're the Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus replied, blessed are you Simon, Son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you're Peter, and on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hades won't overcome it. I'll give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. And he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Having just read that, here are the gigantic reveals that this passage would have brought about for people who were going through this for the first time. First of all, the outstanding question we talked about last week of who is Jesus, even the winds and the waves obey him. The demons blurt out in answer and Jesus is like, yeah, enough of that stuff. So the question has been lingering out there, even though Matthew, the narrator and his best Ron Howard voice is like, it's the Christ, the Messiah, he says that right from the beginning. Still now, the point of view characters are acknowledging it and that puts a little bit of pressure on the audience member to wrestle with who they say Jesus is. So you've got that great big reveal right there. This is the Son of God, the Christ, the Messiah, not some imitator or conjurer of cheap tricks. This is the real deal. So there's reveal number one in this jaw dropping passage. Thing number two that's revealed here is an answer to the question of what's it going to look like though, when God opens the eyes of somebody? We've seen that hinted at. We've seen side characters come and go and you get a sense of what's going on there. But now we get a clear answer. When God opens the eyes of Peter, he recognizes Jesus for who he is. And there's only one response to who Jesus is that the text holds it out as it making any sense whatsoever. The authentic bombshell reveal number three is the opposition. How serious is it going to be? Well, the gates of Hades will not overcome it. Oh, well, so now we know how the end is going to work out. The Jesus team wins. It may appear contested. It may look touch and go even earlier in chapter 16 when the confrontation with the Pharisees and the Sadducees goes so sideways. And Jesus is saying, like, well, I can break the laws of time and space and I can create matter out of non matter. And I know all the things that I'm telling you, the gates of Hades are not going to prevail against this church. It's going to work out. So bombshell number three is spoiler of all spoilers. Jesus wins and evil does not prevail. Bombshell number four, which is often occluded as we look at this passage by those historical theological debates we talked about last time around has to do with this stuff about keys and binding and loosing and all of that business. This is really a follow through on ideas that were introduced in Matthew chapter 10. Remember, the book of Matthew is structured around five big speeches of Jesus. The first is the Sermon on the Mount. That's five through seven. The second is the Missional Discourse at chapter 10. The third that we've looked at so far is the Kingdom Parables Discourse in chapter 13. The second of those again, the Missional Discourse of chapter 10 has three chunks. The first chunk is Jesus sending the disciples out on an immediate right now open world quest. Go tell people about the message of the Kingdom and you don't really need to take a lot of stuff and here's how that's going to go. And then Jesus moves on to like and a little bit later on in your lives, you're going to experience stuff like this. You're going to talk to very powerful people and rulers and it's going to be difficult for you. And then he goes into the third phase of the Missional Discourse in chapter 10. And he's like, and here's how it's just going to be forever as people go out representing me in this way, even beyond you guys. And so we have this question lingering out there. What are future open world quests going to look like? What are your followers going to do? And will they be outfitted with anything or are they just going to be on their own later on? Back to chapter 16. Boom. Raw dropping reveal once again. Here's how it's going to play out. You are going to have some kind of authority of the king as a representative of the king an agent of the king that is going to tap into the power of the king. It's going to happen in at least two ways acknowledging that there are other Christians who might suggest it happens in even more. But with certainty, all Christians can read this passage and agree that this binding and loosing includes the power to communicate the words of life, the message of Jesus that people are going to hear later on and respond to and become Christians, become other children, sons, daughters, heirs, agents of the kingdom. And we see that happen. We see that followed through on in Acts chapter two, as Peter does take these metaphorical keys and gets right up and metaphorically binds and loses as he communicates this message in a marketplace in Jerusalem to a whole bunch of people and a whole bunch of people, thousands of people become Christians that day. We see this play out further in Acts chapter 10 as Peter experiences that holy sheet moment where that sheet is lowered from heaven and a vision and all the animals are on it. And the voice says, take it and eat. And the point of the vision is to say that the message of Jesus is for everybody, not just Jews, but it's for the Gentiles. It's for everybody. And so there again, we see this interaction with an authority and a power that is beyond the physical that commissions and empowers Peter and the other disciples to go out and take the message of Jesus to this larger audience and that that we know is efficacious. But also we figure out just two chapters later when the exact same language is used by Jesus, I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. That's Matthew 18, 18. We know there that the context is maintaining order in church and dealing with stuff that looks like kingdom stuff, but actually isn't and is destructive. And Jesus is saying the same blessing, this equipping, this commissioning is going to go to you disciples and those who come after you to keep church pointed in the direction of Jesus. So we're getting jaw dropping, change everything reveals left and right in this dense little passage. We're getting the one about who Jesus is. We're getting the one about what it looks like when God opens eyes. We're getting a jaw dropping reveal to the question that's been hanging out there about will the bad guys win or is Jesus going to win? We're getting a jaw dropping revelation about how the followers of Jesus are going to have the ability to open away by the power of God that is being shut by the enemies of God. If you flip over to Matthew chapter 23 verse 13 stands out to me here where Jesus says, woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites, you shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces, you yourselves do not enter nor will you let those enter who are trying to. This language is on purpose on the part of Jesus to contrast these poor, unimpressive northerners who he is equipping right now with the authority of God. He's contrasting that with the absolute impotence of the people who dress fancy and hold themselves out as though they wield the authority of God, but they don't. If you like serial style storytelling, if you like it when one episode raises a question and then the next one raises another question and then the next one connects with things that aren't going to be revealed or sorted out until five episodes later, then I hope you're just having a blast with realizing that that's what Matthew is doing here. What I hope we come away from today's conversation with is an appreciation that Matthew 16, 13 20 is not just another, yeah, Jesus and some miracle to God things. God's good and cool. It's more theology, whatever. This is bold revelatory, the kind of thing where if Matthew was releasing the book of Matthew in little episodic chunks one at a time and he didn't, but if he did, this would be the kind of thing that we get a bajillion views and all kinds of buzz on the subreddit and people would be making videos trying to unpack the implications of what's happening here and would be the kind of thing where readers could not get enough of trying to sink their teeth into the massive implications of the reveals that happen rapid fire in this little passage right here. I hope that as we come away from this little conversation today and as we move on from this passage that what we take with us is not first and foremost, oh, that passage is controversial and some Christians disagree about it. Let's know that that is there, but I hope that what we really take from this is all of the proactive massive implication stuff that we have been building up to for a year and a half of looking at this together and here so much of that is spelled out and addressed and answered in one dense, beautiful little passage. I get excited sometimes. Thanks for your patience with me. A mat. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
