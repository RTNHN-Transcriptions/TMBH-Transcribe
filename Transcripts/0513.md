 What's up everybody, it's Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. It's business that we're looking at at the end of Matthew chapter 22 here where Jesus is making an attempt to reason with the Pharisees. All of it hinges on a reference to an Old Testament passage. He uses some weird language that isn't really the way we talk anymore. But it's kind of reminiscent of in Conan the Barbarian when Arnold is like the greatest thing, what's the greatest thing of all? The greatest thing is to cost you all enemies to dive them before you. Adeir the lamentations of their women. It's the best delivered line in the history of film. That's one of those things you hear him say it is just shocking because who really thinks that's the greatest thing in all of life grows, man. But also it gets you inside the head of this uncivilized dark time in fantasy history that the story of Conan the Barbarian is trying to whisk you away to. That language is reminiscent of the way people talked in the ancient Near East in different times about conquests and what it meant to defeat somebody else. People made entire gigantic artistic compositions that they commissioned for gazillions of dollars from the royal treasury to celebrate the awesomeness of their victory. If you go to the British Museum, there's this whole wall up there, this gigantic relief sculpture that was hauled back from, I don't know where I guess maybe Nineveh or around Nineveh somewhere. And it depicts the Assyrian siege of Lachish. That's pretty amazing because it's art from Bible times that depicts an event that was written about in the Bible. And the art was made at the same time that it was written about. This is pretty crazy. But this is indicative of how people thought there was this notion of not just defeating your enemies but making it clear to everyone that your enemies were defeated because it sends a message to everybody else not to mess with you or who it is who has the real true power around here. And we do indeed see that kind of language in the Bible, not just from the bad guys, from the good guys. And that is the kind of passage that Jesus takes us to in Matthew chapter 22 verse, where is it at? It's in 44. The exchange that includes this seemingly barbaric reference starts in verse 41. It says, while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, what do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? The son of David, they replied, he said to them, how is it then that David speaking but the spirit calls him Lord, for he says, the Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. If then David calls him Lord, how can he be his son? No one could say a word and reply. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions. We talked about the narrative side of this exchange yesterday, but I'm interested in his argumentation here. Question number one, which kind of corresponds to the three questions that they just got done asking him. What do you think about the Christ? That's kind of generic and open ended, but we get a little more specificity in question number two. Whose son is he? This takes us to an interesting place because we've seen three titles for Jesus throughout the book of Matthew so far, right? I'm going to give you a second because you know what they are and I'm going to let you look good in front of the people you're listening to. What are the three we keep hearing? And times up. Okay, one is the son of David. No, he's read that a minute ago. So if you got that one, you get like a light high five. Two is the son of man. And that seems to be Jesus preferred title for himself. And we've talked about the connections there with Ezekiel and Daniel and so forth in previous conversations we've had. And then three is the Christ, the Messiah. I suppose four is the son of God, but you only hear that one a few times so far. Again, we just heard the kids yelling son of David back one chapter in twenty one. Where they're all yelling, Hosanna to the son of David and the Pharisees got mad about it. And Jesus quotes Psalm eight back at them. This is from the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise. So they wanted Jesus to tell the people to stop saying son of David, but Jesus went to the Psalms instead one chapter ago to say, no, they're not wrong. And when those blind guys came up and they were like, Hey, son of David, have mercy on us. And tell them like I'm not the son of David. He had mercy on them. And when that serial Phoenician woman, or I guess we call her the Canaanite woman in Matthew's account, the same thing, when she comes up to him on the road trip way up north, when he's getting away from stuff up toward Tyre, she says the same thing. Son of David, and she asks for mercy as well. And he responds favorably to that as well. So anytime that Jesus is being provider or someone is recognizing him for his ability to provide, whether it be justice or material provision or whatever, that son of David title comes out and Jesus rolls with it. So on the surface, it might look like Jesus is inviting the Pharisees into a debate about this son of David title as though Jesus were taking the negative position as always saying, no, no, no, no, he's not the son of David. You got that all wrong. But I think the better way to read this passage in light of the grand context of everything is that what Jesus seems to be arguing for here is that their conception of the son of David is an incomplete conception of what that means biblically and of who the Messiah is supposed to be. I get the impression from the text and I even get the impression from some extra biblical literature that we're probably not going to dive into that some of these Pharisees had a split notion of the Messiah that there was this promise to David. We've talked about that before. That's in 2 Samuel 7. If I'm wrong on that, that's embarrassing. I think it's 2 Samuel 7. And that's where we get the big promise, the deal that God made with David where David was like, I'm going to build you a temple and God's like, yeah, cool. Maybe we'll get to that later. But I'm going to make you a promise instead. There's you're going to have these descendants and you are going to have one, the rules on the throne forever and your throne. It's not going to go away and all this great stuff is going to come out of it. That's not my finest paraphrase ever. But I think you're tracking with it. I think some of these Pharisees were thinking that there is a character called the Messiah who somehow comes out of all of the promises that happen after David and the Messiah is the one that somehow restores the brokenness of Israel, the one who gets referenced a whole bunch in Isaiah. But then there's also this other character in their minds, I think, who's just called Lord. Now, not like what you get in your Bible where it's capital L O R D. That's just Yahweh. That's a way that we abbreviate the astounding powerful holy name of God, that capital L O R D. No, it's not like Lord God. I'm saying that they had this conception of maybe two that were to come or two different titles of ones who were predicted. And one was this Lord character, L lowercase O R D, who was maybe the one that they imagined would be this king who would be from the line of David and would somehow reign. But then maybe there's also this other character who's the Messiah who's going to move things around and set things up. And the Messiah, it looks like some people had a conception that the Messiah was pre-existent and involved in creation and would appear or manifest spiritually. It looks like some others allowed for the possibility that the Messiah would be a physical manifestation. Some others believed that the Messiah wouldn't even know they were the Messiah. It would just be a regular old person who was raised up to throw off the oppressors in military revolutionary fashion. The point is there was not strong agreement on exactly how God's promises were going to be worked out or fulfilled here amongst these religious leaders. And in light of that, it means that when Jesus is bringing this stuff up, he's not just picking a fight with them. He's offering them clarity on one of the questions or issues that have divided them for a long time. And again, what I think he's pointing them toward here is the idea that whoever some of them were imagining is this Lord character and whoever some of them are imagining is this Messiah character, that it's the exact same person. We're already getting well on in time, so we'll break down the Old Testament reference and everything else next time around. But part of the reason that I think there was confusion there that's easy for us to miss but that the original audience would have known was an ongoing debate is because of the way that Peter speaks to it toward the end of his speech at the day of Pentecost. Yeah, here it is. Here is speaking to who Jesus is. And apparently Peter must have been standing right here for this conversation in Matthew 22 because he's alluding directly to it. But it looks like he feels the need to clarify here in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost that this separation in the minds of some between Lord and Messiah, that this is all one person. It goes like this. God has raised this Jesus to life and we are all witness to that fact. Exalted to the right hand of God, he's received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see in here for David did not ascend to heaven and yet he said, the Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a foot stool for your feet. Therefore, let all Israel be assured of this. God has made this Jesus whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ or Messiah. Now at this point, if you're feeling overwhelmed and you're like, I still don't understand that foot stool. Lord said to my Lord, this conquest language you're referencing with Conan, the barbarian back at the beginning, how does this all fit together? Here's how it all fits together to clarify some of the confusion and debate that existed in Pharisee circles about who the Messiah would be and how that relates to the title son of David. Jesus goes right to this Psalm Psalm one tan and he quotes verse one and references this statement of power and authority from a powerful king that will break down more tomorrow. In doing so, he is pointing out that two different characters are involved in the conversation here and that David is the one recording what's going on in this conversation. So he's separating these characters out for the point of clarifying where everybody fits and who the Messiah must be. It may not strike you as incredibly impactful just yet. I think it will more after tomorrow, but apparently it struck the original audience as being very important and speaking to an issue they felt pressure about because when push came to shove and a giant miracle happens at the beginning of Acts and Peter has like just one chance to step forward and grab the microphone and say his thing and move people. He goes right back to this Psalm one ten reference that Jesus came up with and says to the audience as like his closing thought that the Lord said to my Lord said to my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet and in his mind and Peter's mind as it was in Jesus mind. They believed that's a pretty solid closing argument for where the crowds head was at in terms of, hey, look, this Jesus, he is Lord and Christ. He is Messiah. He is all of the summation of everything that you've been looking for from the past in this religion descended from David just as he's supposed to be from God just as he's supposed to be defeating death and the enemy and everything that is wrong and making things right just as he is supposed to do. And I think if we get that context, it's going to be easier when we actually go and look at the text tomorrow to understand how Jesus is interacting with this part of the Bible and the argument he's actually trying to make. This is a lot. Thanks for being a good sport. We will clear this water even more tomorrow as we break it down. A mat is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
