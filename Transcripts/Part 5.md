 Everybody get ready. It's a bonus week. For 10 minute Bible out. Podcast. Let's get ready. It's a bonus week. We're gonna have fun while Matt's on vacation. Oh yeah. Hi, I'm Jeff and this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And we have had fun while Matt's on vacation. And we're gonna have fun one more day here. This is the last of our five broken up pieces of an old talk Matt gave through Matthew chapter 5. It corresponds quite well with what's going on in Matthew chapter 23 with Jesus and the Pharisees. And so we're gonna let Matt take us home. Matthew 5 17. Don't think that I've come to abolish the law or the prophets. I haven't come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear. Not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the law. Until everything is accomplished. Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. But even as the four verses in this chapter take us further down a road of not fixableness. We come back to the lingering hope of verse 17 right at the beginning of this passage. I haven't come to abolish the law but to fulfill them. We know from the next three verses what the consequences of the law are. The law points out our sins and separates us from God. But this fulfillment thing is supposed to leave a question mark for you. It's the little glimmer of hope. It's the so you're saying there's a chance moment. Okay. What is it? Jesus as we read further along is going to clarify the relationship between us and the law. He's going to go through in one law at a time. He's just going to say no matter how good you think you are, you are a lawbreaker. And it is very easy for us to stratify ourselves and say well obviously I'm better than Todd. Come on. But Christi, that's tougher. I kind of know if I'm quite to that point yet. We can do that. We can do the AP top 25 rankings in our brains of how Christian people are but it's stupid. And we might say well I've never done that thing that that person did. So I'm better than them. Well Jesus is going to go through law by law and say here's the fulfillment of this law. Oh you've never killed anybody? Oh so you're better than all the people who have then. Great job. Except I tell you this. You've hated somebody in your heart by the law of God that is tantamount to murder. You are equally as separated from God as someone who's actually plunged the knife. What he does is he's about to systematically take apart every illusion that smug people in the audience might have held about their imagined goodness. One at a time. And maybe the majority of these don't hit home for one person. But maybe one does and one's all it takes because imperfection isn't about a percentage. It's about all or nothing. But Jesus is further going to demonstrate his fulfillment of the law as the image of him as the spotless Lamb of God becomes clearer and clearer. In the Gospel of John chapter 1 verse 29. Remember John the Baptist sees Jesus coming and rather than saying look it's Jesus. A religion's going to be named after him. Or is Jesus he does cool things or is Jesus he's really smart. Listen to him. What's the first thing he says? Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. That's one of those religious phrases that is easy to just allow to wash over us right. Let that sink in for a minute in light of this conversation. Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Lamb of God what is that? It's a reference to the sacrificial system. It's a reference to the law. The Lamb was the thing that you killed as a momentary substitution or atonement for what you screwed up. I don't know how it is for you. I'm glad we don't have this system now. My property is limited in scope. And it cannot house the number of sheep we need to accommodate for my problems. It was an impossible system. All it was was an illusion, not illusion, allusion to how God would resolve this later on. And now the fulfillment is happening. He showed up and right after John said that God himself, the Trinity is together for a moment on earth with God affirming that this is indeed my son. In whom I will please do what he says. Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Not temporarily stays the hand of God to deal with the thing that you screwed up once for a second. But let's do this whole thing again tomorrow. It's a hint that Jesus is the permanent sacrifice, the fulfillment of this whole setup and that in him there's actual atonement for sin. Real atonement. It doesn't exist. Atonement's a myth. You can't turn back time. You can square accounts with somebody, but you cannot turn back time and fix what you've done. Human atonement is fake. It's not real. We just try to get it as close as we can. But this, this is actual. This is an actual picture of the guilt of humankind being actually dealt with and resolved by the work of Christ. We're close to the home stretch, but we're going to do a little bibling right now. We're going to go to John 10. Yes, I could have marked all of these in advance and saved us time, but I didn't. John 10 verse 11, I'm the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. Ha, fulfillment of the law, good shepherd. Jesus is hinting that somehow his life will be traded for the sins of the world, traded for the atoning work of God. Those hints are going to come more into focus as we go along. This fits with the idea of fulfillment. 1 John 2, 2, he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for the sins of the whole world. I'm not reading into this thing that Jesus is saying. It's all over the New Testament. Jesus is that which fixes the unfixable, that forgives the unforgivable, that mends the un-mendable relationship. But you know what? It's not just in the New Testament. Check out Isaiah chapter 53. But he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. We all like sheep have gone astray. Each of us is turned to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. This is the define the relationship. This is it. This is the new covenant between us and God. Right there. Spelled out crystal clear. You, me, society, whether it's our fault or somebody else's this time around, we're broken. We contribute to it, and we're victims of it, and we cannot fix this. And we desperately need it fixed. Because because of this brokenness, we are separate from the God who made us and loves us. That being, which knows us better than we could ever be known. That being who is positioned, the only one who's positioned, to extend to us the love we were designed to receive, to extend to us the purpose we're designed to have in our life. The only one who's in a position to complete what you know deep down you were built for and what you're meant to be. The only being which can deal with the question of death and resolve that which plagues all of us. We're separated from that being by sin, but through Christ, who was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities. The punishment was on him, and we're brought peace where we deserve judgment. This is the truth of the matter. The deal is this. The relationship with God should be won by all accounts of a perfect being saying, you're just not up to standards. You're defective, and I'm through. Maybe I'll try again someday, but not with you. I'm perfect. You're bad for my reputation. Instead, the deal is this. God not only said, you're imperfect, and I love you anyway. God not only said, you're imperfect, and I'm going to continue to invest anyway. He further did it at his own expense. You're imperfect. You're broken. Enemies of God. Flawed deeply with no hope apart from God, and then God looks at that. Rather than doing what we would do, which would be to say, enemies are enemies, he instead says, I can redeem this situation. But I'm going to have to do it with the blood of my own son. So he sends Christ not just to teach these things that are true, not just to define the relationship with his words, but to define the relationship with his actions and with his blood. Do you consider that this offer of grace and peace with God and eternal life is for you and not just others as well?
