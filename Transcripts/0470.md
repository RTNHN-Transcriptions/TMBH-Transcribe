 This is my first year ever of loving flowers. I've always thought flowers were real pretty and I like looking at them and stuff and it's better to have the world with flowers than without flowers, supposed to have been my opinion. But I've never proactively made flowers happen until this year. We got a house and it's fine. I mean, like nothing special or remarkable. It has an old deck on it that again is not special or remarkable. And I wanted to sit on the deck and I wanted it to be pleasant, but it was just dull and drab back there. And then one day I was walking by the garden department at Lowe's and I saw those flowers sitting there and I was like, Oh my goodness, those are really cheap. Like I have enough money to buy those flowers. And so I just bought little baskets of flowers and I was like, I gotta hang them somewhere. So that bought little hangers. And pretty soon I bought four of these little pine trees, like decorative ones. Like you see in Italy and all of these different kinds of flowers that I totally don't know what they are or how they work. And I was like, I guess you got to put water on them and stuff. So I started watering them and I made a little fake fountain myself out of some potting plants and a couple of fish tank pumps. Then I made this little oasis on the back deck and it was really fun. But I'm telling you, it's a sauna back there in the middle of summer and you really do have to water these flowers where they just completely break. And one day it was really hot. I'm hanging out out there with some friends having a beverage and I'm looking at this one plant that's sitting in the sun. I don't know what this plant is like. It's sort of rhubarb-y but a flower. I'm doing a terrible job of explaining it. But like I said, I don't know what I'm talking about. And I hadn't watered this mysterious alien plant with these red stalks that day. And as the conversation went along, I just watched this thing completely flop over. Like remember those toys, they have a little button on the bottom, you push it and then the thing goes completely limp and it just dangles. They're like, oh, and it springs back up. Well, it didn't spring back up. It just went completely droopy and limp before my eyes. And I thought, well, I know one thing that's good for plants. It's water. So I put some more water on there and I thought, well, maybe in a few days, that'll be better. And then I watched it come back to life. The water got sucked up into the other plant parts and it stood back up and it's just, that's incredible. These things are amazing. Why have I not been doing this my entire life? Flowers are awesome. But the point is I have seen what it looks like for something to wither and wilt and dies really, really quickly. They still took a few hours. And this passage that we're looking at in Matthew 21, there are people present who are much more familiar with the life of plants and botanical things than I am. And even so, they were stunned at how quickly, not just some little plant, but like a legitimate hardwood tree type plant just completely wither and wilted and fell apart before their eyes. I took too long to tell you about the thing. I could just read you the passage. So I'm going to read you the passage now and make it up to you. It goes like this. Matthew 21 starting in verse 18. And this is on the road trip back from Bethany, which we talked about yesterday to Jerusalem the day after clearing the temple and having a fight with the religious leaders goes like this. Early in the morning, as he, Jesus, was on his way back to the city. That's Jerusalem. He was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, may you never bear fruit again. And immediately the tree withered when the disciples saw this, they were amazed. How the fig tree withers so quickly, they asked Jesus replied, I tell you the truth. Do you have faith and don't doubt? Not only can you do what was done to this fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, go through yourself into the sea and it will be done. If you believe you'll receive whatever you ask for in prayer. Admittedly, there's a lot here. Let's just take it from the top. We already covered the geography stuff. We're traveling from Bethany back to Jerusalem. This trees along the road and is common practice for people to glean what they needed to glean. We talked about that all the way back in Matthew, whatever it was. The first of the Sabbath controversy was when we're walking along the side of the road. At the beginning of 12, we talked about how you can glean. There were laws and allowances for picking food off the side of the road or going through a field or whatever. And so maybe they can defense of this poor tree. Maybe a bunch of other people are there for festival week and they're on their way making this trip or maybe people are always buzzing back and forth up and down this road. If Bethany is some kind of convalescence village and they just grab food, is there coming and going to see their sick loved ones or whatever? Maybe this thing's been really, really picked over. It doesn't matter. Jesus who knows all things and whose judgment is always correct looks at the fig tree and is disgusted that it is not doing fig tree things. You had one job big tree and that is have there be figs so that I can eat figs. And when there weren't figs, Jesus was like, well, then what is the actual point of view? There's no reason here. And he curses the thing, which feels like a bit of a surprise that I think image that would probably pop to the mind for the original. And so I think the most important thing is that the audience maybe would be Xerxes on his invasion of Greece in the, what would that have been? Fourth, early fifth. Yeah, fifth century BC, I guess. And so he goes and he tries to cross the Hellespont. That's the little stretch of water that divides the Black Sea from the Mediterranean Sea. Am I getting there? I don't have a map in front of me. It's a little stretch of water right there that's very strategic and very important and can be very unruly. A whole lot of people across that water and the water didn't cooperate. He tried to build some stuff to make us get across in the water, wreck this stuff. And so Xerxes is like, it's enough of that. We're going to whip it. And so he had some guys fashion whips and then whip a body of water to, I guess, make his point. And as the story goes, I mean, I guess he eventually got across there. So I guess superstitiously, you could say that it worked, but there was no immediate thing that occurred here. So if anybody had that story in mind and then they hear this story, it's one of those things where they're like, well, if that tree gets cut down in like 80 years or something, you could be like, see, I told you Jesus cursed that thing and it totally came true eventually. But that isn't what happened according to this story, which I think is one of the most curious, superstitious sounding stories in the whole gospel of Matthew. In this account, it just withers right away. It breaks like the opposite of the guy's hand that unwithered that Jesus put vitality back into with merely a word. Here he takes vitality out of a living thing with merely a word. It does seem a little bit petulant on the surface, I suppose, to get some ad that you didn't get a fig. And I guess if he offered no further explanation or there were no context, this would feel more like one of those ancient Near Eastern legends about this or that hero of your who did this or that thing. But there is a lesson and there is a point attached to it. And I also imagine that this type of action, this type of story must have resonated more with the first century, ancient Near Eastern mind than it probably does for you and me. He curses the tree, he says, never bear fruit again, immediately the tree withers. And then the disciples asked what I think is a curious and interesting question. When the disciples saw this, they were amazed again. Just the reaction before we begin to the question is kind of quirky. I mean, they're just coming from Bethany. They watched Jesus as we discussed yesterday, bring a person who'd already been treated for the grave and had been dead for a while. Back from the grave with the word. I mean, they remember when he walked on a choppy sea and when he cast out demons and when he fed 5,000 men plus women and children, then like a couple of weeks later, 4,000 men plus women and children, he healed people from a distance. He made matter appear out of non matter. I mean, they've seen a lot at this point, but still they're amazed. I guess you got to give credit. That's pretty cool, right? They see this stuff all the time and instead of being, yeah, nobody deal. I don't care. They still think it's cool. One time I took a bunch of friends on a road trip to Alaska. We drove all the way from Nebraska to Alaska. And I'm right. And we entered this one little stretch of road, like out in the fjords is an amazing place. And there's bears everywhere all the time, constantly bears. And we saw the first one, I'm like, Hey, bear. And everybody charges the window, almost flip over the vehicle and gawkin and pictures and everything. And everybody's all excited and about a mile later. I'm like, another bear. And the vehicle didn't almost tip over this time, but everybody's still really excited. Then about half a mile later, I was like, another bear. Oh, and there's another one right next to him. People are like, Oh, that's really great. Thank you for continuing to tell us about how there are bears. That's no, that's really cool. Guys, another one. Okay. I'm on a call now though. So you don't need to tell me about every bear. There's another bear. And we saw like 14 bears, but I was the only one who looked at all of them because everybody else was bored and they're like, I get it. I've seen enough bears. I'm not faulting my friends for that. I'm just saying that's how human nature is. The only reason I kept seeing the bears is because I was driving and I didn't want to hit me bears. So I'm no better than my friends. Don't let us say though. Let's give credit where it's due here to the disciples for still thinking that breaking the laws of time and space is cool, even though they've seen it a whole bunch of times. Their question though, it's pretty simple. I don't have the fig tree with her so quickly. How did all the other stuff happen guys? It just kind of seems like all of nature is just bent to the will of Jesus and like his control over nature is something that he uses to demonstrate that he really, really, really means it when he holds himself out as being the king of everything and the maker and sustainer of all things and all of that business. Oh my goodness. Seriously, we did not get nearly as far as I wanted to on this conversation. I wanted to get another whole thing that Jesus said after that. Well, guess what? My friends, we got all the time in the world. So I'm going to hit pause there. But next time around, we got to talk about what Jesus said to them, the possible limits of if you just believe these things will happen. How far does that actually go? Because I believe some stuff really, really, really, really, really hard and it did not happen. What does he mean by this? Are there any qualifiers on it? How does it fit into the larger context of what's going on here and what images from the Old Testament might this little exchange have conjured for the original audience? Miles to go before we sleep, my friends, I'm having a lot of fun with this thing. And I have some pretty fun ideas cooking for things I want to do for the patrons as we get toward the end of Matthew in order to celebrate this accomplishment. Stay tuned for that, I guess, as well. All right, this is fun. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
