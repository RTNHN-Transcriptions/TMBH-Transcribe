 Hey, you ever done the thing where you make a friend in an environment that is not your home turf? You make a friend what you're traveling on an adventure at college while you're on some assignment working away from home for a month or two or whatever. And then at some point you have the opportunity after living out all of your friendship with this particular friend on their turf to be like, hey, could I invite you to come and see my world? And for me, my world is the Mountain West. I grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado. My family is from Wyoming and the Black Hills of South Dakota. We're mountain people. We're West people. I love fly fishing. And it's a different world. The air feels different out here. The seasons work different out here than they do say back East. And so for me, I went to college in Chicago. I made all of these friends in Chicago. And I remember how gratifying it was to have the opportunity to take some of my friends from there and bring them to the West. Because on some level, I felt like they couldn't totally understand me without seeing me in my environment. I felt like I was a fish out of water in Great Lakes territory and school was fine. It went great and everything. But man, getting people out this way was so meaningful. And my friends out here as an adult who have met on the internet and put in a fly rod in their hand and be like, look, this is how you fish with one of these. And look, you go stand in the water just like this. And look, no, not quite like that. Do it like this. And you start pulling fish out and they're like, well, that's awesome. And then they figure out how to do it. And you have this great time together. There is something that is very meaningful about showing someone you care about you in your native environment. Because you know that when they see that, they're going to get you more fully. And there's something very gratifying about seeing a friend in their native environment and understanding them more fully. Likewise in Matthew 17, I think there's a very special moment happening here in the relationship between Jesus and to the three guys who he invited up the mountain to hang out with him for the transfiguration. They have only known him on to stretch the metaphor a bit. Work with me here. Someone else's turf. They've only known him on fully human turf. And they've caught little glimpses of his native environment bleeding over into their turf. But it's still very difficult to wrap their brains around who this person is at his essence. And so Jesus shows them his world. He gives them a more complete look at what he's like in his native environment. In the same way I wanted to take people to Colorado and be like, hey, this is my environment. And these are my friends in the relationships that make me. So Jesus is like, here's my physical native environment. This is what I look like when I'm not doing the human thing. And also I want to introduce to you to my friends. Maybe you've heard of him. It's Moses and Elijah, except he didn't do the smug, super fancy thing. But this is who Jesus hangs out with. These are relationships that he wanted to put in front of these guys. So yes, there is the profound theological element that we looked at last time around. But there is also the profound relational element that we're seeing unfold here. Imagine what this would have been like for the point of view characters as they encounter this. Matthew 17, no, we're going to start in 1628. Jesus wraps up a whole thing about saying what it takes to really follow him and why it makes sense by saying, I tell you the truth, some were standing here and not going to taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom. Very next verse 17, 1. After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James and John, the brother of James, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as light. Just then there appeared before them, Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus. So look, last time around, we talked about the theological significance of this and the historical significance of this. What does it mean that Moses and Elijah were there in terms of the grand historical theological narrative of the Bible that you and I've put a ton of time into? Just now we're processing the relational aspect of this transfiguration. Like, hey, this is what I actually look like. This is who I actually hang out with. This is what my environment is. This is the environment that makes me me, though, that doesn't totally apply to an immutable God, but you get what I'm doing with the metaphor there. But there's another element that's going on here. That is the epistemological element for the disciples who got to go on this trip. And by epistemological, I mean the truth element, the knowing element. You think about it, they just went from seeing a whole bunch of evidence that, boom, pops to the surface out of an otherwise mundane reality that looks just like their own. But now the whole thing is flipped and the natural world is what is the odd man out. The natural world is the exception and the glory of Jesus and the physical chatty presence of the exalted dead. That is the reality that's right in front of your face and everything else fades into the background. Now let's just think for a minute about what that would do to your brain. I want to ask you to run a really honest math equation in your brain right now, whether you are a person of devoted not belief, a person of, I don't know exactly what to make of all of this, but I guess I lean toward not belief, a person of, I don't know exactly what to make of all this, but I'm going to hedge my bets and lean toward belief. A person who would say, I really hope all of this is true, but I still have doubts or a person who would say, I almost never have any doubts and I am just fully in. No matter who you are, I just want to ask you this question. How would it affect your threshold of belief equation that we're all running all the time if this happened right in front of your face? If you were there at the transfiguration and you saw that thing occur, well, for me, it would change things tremendously. That would be the moment where my faith becomes sight. That would be the moment where I go from I used to kind of know a little bit and sort of theologically speculate. Now I've moved from, this isn't really speculation anymore. Like I don't really know in part, I am seeing in full the reality of who God is, at least as best as I'm able to see it with these mortal eyes. This for me right here is why when I run the three time travel tokens exercise to test where my heart and my mind are really at and I say, all right, George Carlin shows up and he hands me three time travel tokens. I don't know why did I say George Carlin? I associate him with being in some kind of time travel movie. Was he in Bill and Ted's? Maybe he was a guy in Bill and Ted's. I don't know. I'm sticking with George Carlin. He shows up and he gives me three time travel tokens and he's like, you can use these on whatever you want, but you don't get a fourth and no time travel tokening for a fourth time travel token. Where are you going? Well, that reveals the things of the heart, doesn't it? I know two of them for sure. I think I know all three, but I'm not comfortable saying the third. I would use one to unmake the most hurtful thing I ever said or did and un hurt the heart of people I love. I would use the second to go and warn my brother so I could have him back. That's probably pretty selfish and would ruin all of space time, but I still think I would use my time travel token on that anyway, and we just take a chance. The third thing I would do and this actually would be priority one would be to go see Jesus. I would delve deeply into first century Aramaic and Greek so that I was super, super ready before I used the coin and then I would time travel right to the beginning of Jesus public ministry. I would be equipped with knowing all the stuff from the Bible. So I would like know what to say and how to give the right answers now that I think I can trick Jesus or God. And I would bum around with him and I would be as much in that inner circle as I could possibly be to see it all myself. And he would know why I was there and it would make me more Thomas than Thomas. I understand that I get like all of the character flaws that go along with this. But if you want to lay bare my heart to flip faith to sight because of the incredible frailty and weakness of my faith ability, that's what I would want to do. Flip that thing to sight. Give me hard fact. Let me see Jesus in his glory. I doubt that even if I were there, I'd be allowed to participate based on what I'm reading in the Bible. I think I'm probably coming at that with the wrong attitude, but whatever I said, we were going to do this thing honestly. And I've done this thing honestly. The truth of the matter is if I were at the transfiguration, it would dramatically change stuff. And my best, most sure faith day ever, seeing this and removing all doubt would take me to a place of asking the question constantly, what the heck am I doing with my life? Why would I do that? Not this. Why would not everything I do be about this far greater reality than this one here? And let's just be honest, a lot of times you go to church and that's a pump up speech. And it's like, well, if you really believe you'd really get after this, but for some of us, that's kind of horrifying because at that point, that's your everything. No more hedging any bets and no more wrestling with the question and having that consume a bunch of energy. I guess it would just be go, go, go. And I don't even know how it would be go, go, go. Well, I don't think it's weird or surprising at all that two of these three guys ended up dying violent, horrible, murderous deaths in the pursuit, the single minded pursuit of Jesus, the God who they saw in his glory to some extent right here. This is what they did with the rest of their lives. They were all in forever permanently. That's it. Nothing else matters. I am 100% dialed on this thing and it cost them everything physically. And the Bible teaches that it gained them everything also. John on the other hand lived out a very long life, but that long life seems to have been devoted entirely to the God behind this encounter. The bottom line is Jesus had a circle of friends. He seems to have really cared about them. They seem to have really cared about him. They were all from a place and on the surface, it seemed like he was from that place too. But over time, hanging out together, it became clear that Jesus was from somewhere else and that they weren't really seeing him in his native environment. So finally, for whatever reason, three of them got the opportunity to see him in something that looks more like his native environment, even if it was just a little sliver of his native environment. And it seems to have changed the equation for those three guys in such a way that you look back on verses 24 through 27 and all of that stuff about taking up your cross and following me and what a minute ago might have sounded like a little bit much. Suddenly to those three is the biggest no brainer ever. Because Jesus is the truest, realist thing ever. Everything we suspected about him and more, it turns out, is true. And they got to see something that settled the faith equation question in a way that you and I don't. And as a result, this profoundly beautiful, theological, historical, narrative, relational event, epistemological event changed the trajectory of their entire lives and the history of the entire world sense. I want to think about there. I'll be more on all of this next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
