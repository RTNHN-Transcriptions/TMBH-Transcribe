 We're going to talk about things in this episode that those of you who listen with children are in delicate situations Like you just want to listen to it first to make sure it doesn't get weird and ruin their childhood. Thanks I think it was Jimmy Carter who's one of the nicest people ever I think I don't know for sure what to think about his politics or his legacy It's kind of a non-legacy Sort of an odd presidency for him. He's far enough back that it doesn't feel super loaded with modern political issues to just talk candidly about that So I'll say Carter in my brain is like in the sea minus d plus Half soggy frosted mini wheats mediocre range of things as a president But he said something that he got really grilled for politically, but I appreciate what he was trying to communicate He was trying to communicate a kingdom value from right here in Matthew chapter five I've looked at a lot of women with lust and I've committed adultery in my heart with them or something like that And I don't I don't know if at that point in history that phrase It kind of gone out of the modern mind and that brought it back in or if everybody knew exactly what he was talking about But certainly this is a passage that a lot of people who've been alive a little longer will associate with jimmy carter and a campaign trail gaff I think there's more going on here as we get yet another one of these statements of jesus where he's talking about what It is for him to be the fulfillment of the law and he's going piece by piece through it He's talking about how everyone really effectively has guilt and is insufficient in their behavior through the law He's making another one of these you have heard that it was said, but I tell you statements and this one goes like this verse 27 Matthew five you've heard that it was said don't commit adultery But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully is already committed adultery with her in his heart If your right eye causes you to sin Gouch it out and throw it away. It's better for you to lose one part of your body Then for your whole body to be thrown into hell And if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away It's better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell Let's work backwards on this one because i'm guessing there are a lot of people including me who are kind of hung up on the hell thing Is jesus really saying that there's a hell and people might go there Okay, well a few schools of thought on this unless just cover them real quick so that we can talk about the adultery thing Dultery in hell in one day. Oh my goodness. This one's gonna get a ton of downloads. We're having a great time I should have a promotional giveaway at the end of like fruit snacks or something So we got something to look forward to but you're not getting fruit snacks. Okay, here's the deal Uh the hell thing some people would say it's a myth. It's a metaphor It's a holdover from the Septuagint word for Hades and it's kind of Lost in translation conjuring the idea of some sort of general underworld That maybe would involve some sort of separation from god or maybe more is uh is more of a greek idea That we don't get in our modern english translation. There are other people who look at the language about hell in the new testament and they would say Uh, this is a description of an ultimate destruction of the soul This position is called annihilationism and when someone dies out of fellowship with god outside the The covering grace of jesus they experience a destruction and obliteration and annihilation of their soul They do not go on suffering. They simply cease to be and there are other people who would say That there is some kind of punishment or permanent separation from god that occurs and still others would say That permanent separation is not only conscious But they would take it a step further and say that permanent separation also involves some kind of like punishment and pain whether that pain would be just being apart from god forever or there's actual like an added element of Some kind of physical or spiritual pain that goes along with it Now when you think about the equation of hell and what to do with it probably is going to sub in whichever one of those versions has been most drilled into your head through pop culture or Looney tunes cartoons with pitchforks and You know pointy tales and all of that stuff or an angry street preacher who you heard yelling about things or or who knows what What I do know is this Whatever you bring to the table on that topic It's going to really inform how you read a passage like this and it's going to tempt you to check out on jesus Prematurally because of assumptions other people have thrown out I mean one of the biggest places where we get our assumptions about hell is from dante's inferno Which was meant to be a little bit of a satire of the parody a takedown So it's kind of crazy that we draw some of our cues on it from that. I would say this I think the right play for the moment is to acknowledge That jesus is at least giving a nod to the notion that the religious expectation is that there is Some kind of sorting out that happens at the end of all of this Now it's become fashionable in recent years to suggest that there is no sorting out at the end of this that jesus came and he did all this stuff and I guess It was for his health. I don't know. I've always struggled with this position And that in the end it doesn't matter if people ever know about who he is or what he did It's all just kind of you know comes out in the wash And in the end there is no sorting out of What happened with who we were and how we lived and and how that interacts with the grace of jesus and what he did on the cross It could be i'm really not able to sort that all out right now, but it looks like the text Indicates that jesus has a conception of a reckoning that happens after death That judgment is part of the deal and that what he's doing with all of this redemption stuff and the inauguration of this kingdom Is talking about this thing that he's building that is the antithesis of that judgment and that separation from god What the kingdom is fellowship and union with god and being in it kind of is The gospel of jesus Man was that a minefield? I don't even know if i got it right as I hope you still like me and if you don't I hope it's for good reasons and not just that So jesus acknowledges in some way the notion of a judgment here by his use of the word hell But how metaphorical is he being with talking about people maiming themselves? We're working backward through the passage if you haven't figured it out. There's a guy named origin He did most of his work in alexandria. I feel like maybe later in life. He was in seseria I could be wrong on that Whatever the case he's uh one of the church fathers has read a decent amount of the stuff that he said He doesn't really line up with anybody fully I mean catholics definitely claim him but not everything that he said lutherans Like to quote a bunch of stuff from origin because at times it looks like he supports them But they don't claim everything he said and one of the places where I would just like to personally distance myself from one of the stories surrounding origin Is that apparently some people believe or had reason to suppose that he emasculated himself? In response to this passage reading this as something literal I got a problem with a part of my body that caused me to fail. It'd be better to just make that go away Yikes Kind of in keeping with origins possible read on this passage. I think there are a lot of people Certainly this was the deal in my youth group at times growing up Who would read this as oh if your right eye causes you to sin And your right hand causes you uh we're talking about pornography and masturbation got it Yeah, I mean maybe I could see what jesus might be driving at here. That is what he's driving at He's going with a very euphemistic approach to speaking to it And whether he's specifically talking about that stuff or not what he does seem to be driving at is like look your body which has Understandable natural biological sexual urges part of the deal that jesus knows that you know he fully participated in creation He knows that's hardwired into people. It's part of the deal It's how the proliferation of humanity is carried out in jesus himself as part of the trinity the triune godhead Ordered humanity to proliferate and populate the earth and cultivate things So like the sexy thing is part of the deal is supposed to be part of the deal So settle down a little bit on the anti sexy thing But at the same time it looks like it's supposed to be targeted in a certain direction And well, this is another one of those things where Maybe the social pressure of the day The prudishness of the day the expectations the risk of getting caught the risk of getting a disease Would keep some people from committing adultery and then being able to say look what I never did So not only have I never murdered I have also Never committed adultery. So I will take my second cookie now Please because that's two notties that I haven't committed So clearly the formula first and foremost here what we need to take from it Is the larger context formula is just yeah, okay, you don't actually get your cookie Nope, no anti adultery cookie. I mean, that's good that you haven't committed adultery jesus is affirming that law But he's taking it deeper by saying but all of you think like you're good and better than everybody else I mean, why does adultery happen and what happens with your eyes? What happens with your body? There's a whole bunch of little decisions that get made before you make that bigger decision And there are decisions of the heart and there's stuff that you choose to nurture there And I am so not lecturing any of you on this at all and just trying to paraphrase What jesus is saying here and if you're uncomfortable, well, guess what? I'm uncomfortable too I think this is the first time I've ever actually awkwardly fidgeted with my hands while i'm recording this stuff I'm just messing with the little thing here that comes out of my bible and moving my phone around Because this is a weird thing to talk about you need some podcaster telling you what to do or what to think or What to do if like you accidentally look at somebody and you're like, ah, look at them Look at the way they're shaped. I'm trying to be vague. That's attractive to me It makes me feel things inside I don't know what to tell you to do about that There are people who write books and they're like you should look for one one thousand and then look away And if you look twice and that was naughty really I don't see that in the text. I don't know It's hard. I can tell you this for sure It is clearly saying To take stock of what happens at the level of the heart and then somehow at some level that seems to matter and that somehow at some level Any sense of sanctimoniousness or self-righteousness or betterness than everybody else that You or I might feel is kind of burst when we think about the most primitive urges of the self One being the primitive urge to procreate the other being the primitive urge to take what we want from other people Well, that's adultery and that's murder And Jesus is saying again Just not doing the actual action He is not what it means to live in keeping with the values of the kingdom To really truly have this law fulfilled Is to demonstrate that there's something much deeper going on that is proactively right But i'm gonna take one more minute and i'm gonna steal my thunder from where we're going with this whole thing I think it's just time because this was awkward. What's Jesus really driving out with all of this Is there any way for you to not hate somebody? I mean you can nurture something that's better and right but you're gonna get it wrong You're gonna say mean stuff and if you don't you're gonna think mean stuff. I just I don't know what to tell you You're gonna get it wrong Is there really any way to not look at somebody else and be like they are sexually attractive that is hot I don't know if you know email me. I would be very interested in that. Nope People find other people attractive sometimes in ways that maybe aren't even totally appropriate or healthy to think about But you're not gonna get that perfectly 100 percent right And so for me getting past the murder and reconciliation thing and the adultery thing I'm feeling one real strong impulse at this point as a reader. No two one is discomfort and the other is Oh wait, no, they're both discomfort and the other is I can't do this. I can do better I can care I can be cognizant I can try I can confess I can desire to get it right but I can't do this And even if I got it right from here on out, I still didn't always get it right So I guess my righteousness cannot surpass those of the Pharisees the teachers of the law I think that's what you're supposed to take from it I think this is a systematic takedown of your imagined righteousness and mind I don't think it is designed to make us despair Or to cause us to start evaluating the quality or health of our relationship with god by What thought we thought in passing in that moment or that moment? I don't think that's the game and unfortunately that too often is how these passages actually play out in the heads of christians you know, this is like weird System of good and bad rankings and you try and score points by not thinking this and you make yourself crazy with that kind of stuff No, I think he's saying embrace kingdom values, but also you can't apart from me You're not supposed to despair because you realize that you can't get this right What you're supposed to do instead is finally feel the full weight of the law That even if you behaved better than anybody ever and you never physically did any of the naughty things You are still broken. You are still in need of a savior in order to have access Into this truest realist thing, which is the kingdom and we got to flesh that idea out a whole bunch more as we go along This was hard. Thank you for hanging with me through it. Thanks for thinking about it truthfully with me too A mat is the 10 minute Bible hour. Let's do it again soon You
