 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. And this one is about the whole Old Testament. Hello everyone, my name is Matt Whitman and I just finished reading the Bible several, several times through. I don't know actually how to count it because there's some of these books that I had to read a lot. Some of them I read maybe only twice in the last few months. But here's the thing, at the end of all the episodes, we're being honest with each other and the reality is you all have jobs and stuff to do. And I mean literally this is what I do. I hang out in my basement and I read the Bible and then I talk into this microphone and then sometimes you listen to it, it's real cool when you do or you don't have to, it's cool, whatever. So I have time to do this because you've made it possible for me to have time to do this. So that means that at the end of each of the episodes, I've tried to give you the quick version of a book. Like, hey, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, just make sure you go and read this part. And that way, if you're swamped right now, you can at least get a feel for each of these books. Well, this episode is the, if you didn't have time to listen to the whole series or if you did have time, but you don't have time to go back and listen to it again to internalize it more, make sure you at least catch this episode because we're going to cover the big story of the Old Testament and it's going to happen real fast and I'm already burning time by yammering on and on and on. So here's what I see. The Old Testament holds itself out as starting in time immemorial and that's not even the right word because it's even before time immemorial. It's before time was even really a thing where there were any measurable factors by which you could tell there was time. And so there's a theological reality in the very opening moments of the Bible, which is God predates everything about existence as we know it and all of the orienting factors from the physical world as we understand it. God predates that as well. He is being, he is essence, he transcends all of it. So right from the beginning, we get a sense that this God character is completely other. He's operating on a different plane in a different greater reality with the ability to push and pull and navigate things for his purposes in ways that are totally not accessible, not possible for any mortal created finite physical being like you or me. So then out of nothing, God creates existence in the physical world and he creates people in his image. But then along comes this shady serpent character and the serpents like, I'm opposed to the plan of God. So here's a way that I can wreck it and through the serpent's temptation and influence, the woman and the man sin and now we get to the fork in the road. Will God say, I made a thing. It didn't work out. He's going to make another thing and see if this one goes better or was God's plan, who was surprised by nothing all along to redeem the whole dang mess and he made stuff knowing full well it would go off the rails because there was some point about himself or something he wanted to accomplish in redeeming. Well, thankfully it's the latter and he embarks on this redemptive plan. And right here is where we get the first hint, the first initial promise that there is going to be one who is going to come and crush this whole system that is represented by the serpent and how the serpent thinks and opposes God. And so this whole proposition of redemption is wrapped up in that character, but we don't know much about that character yet. Then after that, we go through this whole primeval age, who knows how much time is covered in there, but there are a bunch of different incidents that demonstrate that humanity is not going to get this figured out. He has a problem that humanity cannot solve and a new paradigm is going to be needed for humanity to be made right with God. Well, then we get into the super ancient, but not maximum ancient part of the Old Testament where we meet a guy named Abraham. God makes a special covenant with Abraham saying that the redemptive plan is going to flow through him big time paraphrase there, but it's a fair paraphrase and that God is going to make a great nation with tons of descendants out of Abraham and that all the nations will be blessed through him. Ah ha, now we're getting a clearer picture. This looks like a regional local patron ethnic deity kind of situation, but this one's different. This one's going to go global. This one was always for everybody. This is wild. Abraham's descendants have all kinds of sorted adventures up and down. And ultimately, a lot of oversimplifying here, it's 12 of Abraham's great grandkids who after a period of slavery in Egypt, their descendants become the 12 tribes of Israel. And after Moses, one of their great leaders receives the law from God, which enables them to have some interaction with a God as holy as this one, they move into the promised land of Canaan. They conquer it in the book of Joshua, and then they promptly begin to fall apart and make all the mistakes that all of humans have ever made in the era of the judges. These are a complete moral dumpster fire in the age described in the books of first and second Samuel. We see the people are like, I guess we need a king. And despite warnings, the kings take you down a dark path. They're like, now we really want one. And so they get one and predictably, even though there's some good stuff there in the early going with Saul and then David and then Solomon, the kingdom splits up into north and south and they start fighting and they have tons of corrupt kings and pretty much nothing goes right up in the north. But there are a couple of really notable good things that do come out of this early era of the kings. And that is first a promise that God makes to David. David decides that God needs a permanent dwelling place where he can live in the holy of holies amongst his people. He's like, I'm going to build you a great temple. And God's like, nope, I'm going to have one of your descendants do that, but I'm going to give you something instead. And it's a promise that there is going to be a line of kings that come from you, David. And in spite of all of your flaws and your problems, this lineage will never end. And one is going to come down the road who will be the great king who will reign forever on your throne. And the intonation is that this is that through line of redemption. We've been tracking so far through the Old Testament. So that's exciting. And then the other good thing that comes out of the early age of the kings is that Solomon, the son of David does go ahead and build a temple, a permanent dwelling place for God. And it is a very impressive temple. But as amazing as that temple must have been to behold, it cannot withstand the societal rot, the societal systemic evil and injustice and sin of the people and the horrible leadership that is always on display in the northern kingdom of Israel and in the southern kingdom of Judah. Those are the two different kingdoms of the descendants of Abraham that emerged, one in the north, one in the south. And so after a bunch of really tumultuous interactions with their neighbors, the northern kingdom falls to Assyria in 722 BC and is lost to history, just gone. And then sometime later in 586 BC, the southern kingdom falls to the new big bad empire on the block that's come along by this point that is Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. And in the process of that fall, the temple that Solomon built for God to dwell among his people is destroyed and left in ruins. And pretty much all of the people who remain who are descended from Abraham are taken far off to the east in captivity in Babylon. But that's not the end of the story. During this era of the kings and during this time of exile that was initiated in 586, God sends all these prophets to talk about how God is judging what's wrong with his people, but also that God is keeping his promises and that the redemptive plan is still on. And these prophets keep fleshing out the idea of the Messiah, this Redeemer who was predicted clear back in the garden with the promise of one would crush the head of the serpent. And in addition to rightly keeping hope alive by pointing to more and more specifics about this Messiah who is still to come and reign on the throne of David forever, the prophets also talk about a narrative, a direction, a future vision for all of history and how things are going to play out. And they talk about this concept of the day of the Lord, which looks like it is partly realized in ancient history, but will ultimately be realized in the future in a day that holds terror for the evil kings and empires, but awe and glory and rejoicing for those who have been oppressed and the victims of injustice and for those who are found to be in God. And as we find out later caught up in the redemptive work of the Messiah who he is yet to send. Eventually the narrative of the Old Testament rounds out with the Babylonians getting defeated by the Persians and then the Persians taking a different tack and being like, you know what, let's let you go back and rebuild this thing. Process of rebuilding gets going in the very late 500s. B.C.s. I was talking like 500 years before the birth of Jesus and the building isn't easy. The politics of Persia get in the way, but over the course of the reigns of a few great kings of Persia, a second temple is built, though it's admittedly smaller and more modest. The walls of Jerusalem are reestablished. The priesthood gets back to work doing the sacrifices and all of the life of the temple stuff in Jerusalem. And even though there's a ton of positivity and the preservation of the line of David and the mechanism by which all the prophecies pointing toward the Messiah might be fulfilled, we still close out the Old Testament feeling like, hmm, the lessons have not really been learned here. And even if those lessons could be learned, it looks as though humanity is simply incapable of solving their own problems, of atoning forward, preventing managing their own sin. And for the attentive reader, the Old Testament wraps up begging for a new paradigm in this relationship between God and man, because humanity is clearly not going to be able to hold up their end of the bargain. Humanity clearly is not going to be able to solve its own problems. We're going to need something as we roll toward the New Testament that is way more God heavy in terms of him doing the heavy lift on this redemptive work. When you visualize the Old Testament, picture stone tablets on which the law of God is written. When you think about the theme of the Old Testament, reflect on how God will redeem despite human resistance and failure along the way. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, which would be understandable, let me give you three passages that I think are particularly important. Genesis 12, 1 through 3, 2 Samuel 7, the whole chapter, and then go and catch Isaiah 48, 9 through 11, which tells you a little bit about God's motives in seeing this whole thing through. And with that, coupled with having gone through each book individually together, I think we have earned our level up sound on the Old Testament. Okay. If you haven't figured it out by now, next time around, we're going to do the too long did not listen version of the New Testament or for those of you who did listen to all of it, the helpful recap and summary of all of it so we can see the whole thing as one big picture and appreciate the pay offs that come at the end all that much more. Don't forget, if you are listening to this in real time, we are just three episodes away from starting our next series on the book of Esther. It's going to be fascinating and fun. I think you're going to love it and I would be honored if you'd consider marking that on your calendars and inviting somebody else to be apart as well. All right. I think that's good for today. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon. This podcast is supported by many of you at patreon.com slash the TMVH podcast.
