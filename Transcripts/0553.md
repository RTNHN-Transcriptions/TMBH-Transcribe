 I've never seen that meme that's got like nine people arranged in a tic-tac-toe board style and then up at the top of the meme it says something like, here are all the people I want to thank for doing this thing and then it goes through and it says, you, you, you, you, not you, you, you, you, you, you. And the joke is like all these people, they did the thing they're supposed to do and then this one person, they're like the goats, not greatest of all time, like the goat, like the scapegoat, like you're the big idiot who got all the stuff wrong and I just want to point that out with a meme. That's kind of what we're getting here at the very, very end of Matthew chapter 23 where Jesus invokes the language of Daniel chapter nine with that word desolate saying to the Pharisees, look, your house is left to you, desolate land. It looks like it's nice and you got all these things and everything's great and temple systems running, but it's not. You've got a mess here and you're the ones who are causing this abominable desecration of what's going on, but and this is where it pivots verse 39 for I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, but you guys fouling up the temple and making this gigantic mess that resulted in the pronouncement of all these woes and the pronouncement of judgment, even with all of that stupidity, even with all of that blood lust, even with all of that ugly, what Jesus is saying here in the very last verse of chapter 23 is even so God is still going to redeem. The redemptive plan is on God's work is on you in spite of your best efforts could not derail it. This little verse looks like it's nudging us into the material we're going to encounter in chapter 24, which is very much about the unfolding of time and how everything is going to work out and play out and what Jesus role and all of that is going to look like even in the distant future. And we're going to have plenty of time to unpack all of that when we actually get into it. But here at the simplest level, what we're getting is that meme, God, the Holy Spirit, the people who were faithful, thank you to all of you for making the redemptive plan happen. But oh, right there in that one square, the Pharisees, yeah, not thank you to you. Jesus is referencing Psalm 118, which is a monster psalm in terms of messianic stuff. This is the one that starts with, give thanks to the Lord for his good, his love endures forever. Let Israel say, his love endures forever. Let the house of Aaron say, his love endures forever. Let those who fear the Lord say, his love endures forever. And there's a stuff about it. My anguish, I cried out, and there's all of this difficult stuff. And you get the thing that I think this is the verse that some people say is the middle verse of the whole Bible. I don't know if that's actually been verified, but that would be it is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man. And then verse 9, because I think you need two verses for it to make the middle because it's odd. Maybe I don't know exactly how that works. It says it's better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes. And then there's more language about the psalmist being surrounded by the nations and all of this thread of bloodshed and death. But then verse 13, I was pushed back and about to fall, but the Lord helped me. The Lord is my strength and my song. He has become my salvation. Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous. The Lord's right hand is done mighty things. It's incredible how much of this language you just know from different places, from Christianity in the Bible and songs. Like I said, this is just a really, really big one. Then verse 22, oh yeah, we've talked about this a bunch. The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone. The Lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. You've heard that one too. Verse 25, Oh Lord, save us. Oh Lord, grant us success. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord from the house of the Lord. We bless you. This is not a hard Psalm to interpret. It's a contrast between the relentless pressure of planet earth and existence and all of the forces that want to consume and destroy and wreck. This mostly focuses on the ones outside the walls, but the context Jesus is invoking this Psalm in. Obviously draws a parallel with some who are counter agents working inside the walls. But despite all of that pressure, the psalmist calls out to the Lord because it's better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man. It's better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes and God in the Psalms shows up and delivers. And then there's this shout of celebration as people were like, yeah, we knew it. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord from the house of the Lord. We bless you. It's this ovation of victory and success that the people who theoretically, the religious leaders were to guide and shepherd through the centuries. Those people latched onto this language. They knew there was hope in it. They knew there was promise in it. And so it's going to hit hard for them when Jesus says, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Right here at the end of chapter 23, because it would have set the minds of everybody else at ease as they listen to all of these woes and all of this richly deserved condemnation. Maybe they get to the end of Jesus remarks and they're like, well, did you want to gather me under your wings? Because I kind of wanted to be gathered still. Is that an option or is this desolation just a done deal? And by invoking this, perhaps most famous of all Psalms, if it's not, it's really, really close. And particularly this phrase from that Psalm, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, what he's telling the room is the deliverance plan is still on the redemption of this whole mess. That is still a go. We are nearing the completion of the story arc of those who resisted God plan for them. But the redemption for those who bend the knee to God in his plan, that deal is full speed ahead. And that is the note on which we close the very difficult, very challenging, very confrontational Matthew chapter 23. Whoo. And exhale. All right. Next up is 24. It's very challenging, but it also strikes a very different tone and forces us to ask very different questions. I'm looking forward to it. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
