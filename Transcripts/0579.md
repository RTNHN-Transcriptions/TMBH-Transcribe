 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. We're in Matthew chapter 24, trying to make sense of Jesus, all of it discourse to the fifth of the five big speeches around which Matthew structures his account of the life of Jesus. The disciples show up and they want to know, how's this all going to go down? What's the end game look like for history and how will we know when you're about to return? Jesus, so far, has broken down the answer into three parts. Part one, there's going to be some birth pains and this is just history, being history. Just be faithful, you don't really need to do anything here. When we get too close to the end, you'll know. Part two is a description of this thing that we just spent the last week on called the abomination of desolation. Apparently there's going to be some kind of profound event, some profaning of the temple that is going to signal that, oh, now we're getting somewhere, it's going to trigger some stuff. And then what we're looking at right now is the stuff that's going to lead up to the return of the king, the coming of the son of man. And it looks like there's going to be some struggles, whether this is a very short window or whether this era of struggle refers to the whole age of the church moving forward until the return of Christ is something that people debate, but that there will be this tribulation, this difficult time seems to be present in the text here, but then the son of man is going to come back. And we're working on that section where Jesus describes the run up to the return of the son of man right now. At this time, I would like to ask my friend, Jeffrey, who has a beautiful heart and beautiful musical skill set to play some music, and then we're going to pick up where we left off yesterday. ["Pomp and Circumstance"] At that time, verse 23, if anyone says to you, look, here's the Christ, there he is, don't believe it. For false Christ's and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect if that were possible. See, I have told you ahead of time. Okay, I got to step back to that elect word real real quick. Do you remember back in, what's I got to be chapter 11? Because it's in response to the stuff, John the Baptist disciples and people asking questions. Yes, it is, it's the end of chapter 11. And Jesus gets done being like, hey, what are you all looking at criticizing John the Baptist? You guys got problems too. And he kind of fires off at the whole generation, rolling off at the question John the Baptist disciples had asked him about whether he was a Christ or somebody else. And at the end of that, in this oft forgotten little bonus part, he says, at that time, Jesus said, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and to learned and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. All things have been committed to me by my Father, no one knows the Son, except the Father, and no one knows the Father, except the Son, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. So we do get some pretty overt language right there about God's supernatural role in softening people's hearts to understand the kingdom values and the kingdom and to recognize Jesus for who he is and as troubling as it is. And we explored this at great length, hundreds of episodes ago when we were in Matthew 11 back there. It looks like much like he did with Pharaoh, there can also be a hardening of the heart. And Jesus is indicating that, look, anybody who follows Jesus, he's giving credit to the Father for giving them to him. So this double use of the word elect here on the part of Jesus in Matthew 24 could open a can of worms that I guess we've already kind of opened and sifted through. It can be troubling for some who are like, I don't want God picking that stuff. And to whatever degree God does pick, as you and I conceive of picking, I think for the person who reads the book of Matthew, we just have to be in a place where we're like, look, this document is describing a God who is being held out is completely unlimited. Unsurprisingly, never learned anything, has always known everything. So this isn't like your mean friends who picked people in gym class to be on their teams and we got picked last. It's not that, it's not like a government official going through and being like, you get benefits, you don't get benefits, you do. Those are peers who really aren't equipped to judge or make any such determinations. And rightly, there's some offense to our notion of justice when we see that. On the other hand, God is not just an exaggerated version of people as he's held out by the Bible. He's essence in its essence. He is the full culmination of being. He is truth. He is rightness. Everything about him is correct and immutable and unchanging. He's just so very, very other, even though he took this great step to make himself knowable and to be here as a human as well. Like still, the limitations of this God are nothing. There's really no way to get around the idea that however we think of picking or choosing or electing or foreknowledge or whatever, he knows he's sovereign over all of it. And yeah, that's a pretty clumsy category when we try to think of God as an exaggerated person or a superhero. But when you think of God as the all-knowing unlimited, never learning anything because he already knew all the things unbound by time, champion of all of existence, it becomes kind of an inescapable notion and frankly a very biblical notion that this idea of God having elected somehow, that is this idea of the elect. And that concept for those of you who are really into theology is not one that is owned by Augustine and the first millennium Catholic church that is not something that is owned by the craft beer, bearded bald, dazzled jeans, flannel shirt wearing, reformed crowd. This idea is a Bible idea. People take it in a lot of different directions, but again, what we're trying to do with our conversation here is just look at what is directly in the text. But it matters here for our conversation because Jesus isn't looking into these followers who he's trying to give a heads up about what it's gonna look like in the end of time. His father gave him those followers. They were again, however you conceive of choosing when you're talking about a God who operates outside of time and has unlimited capacity and is surprised by nothing. However you would define or think of that word, are they chosen? They were picked, they are precious to God. Followers of Jesus are precious to Jesus. So again, when Matthew was quoting Jesus as using the word elect here in Matthew 24, it's not like, okay guys, I know this is kind of a weird, touchy thing. And I know we've had some run-ins on the internet with people from different internet pubs who have different opinions and it can be really testy, but no, this is a point of celebration. Every time this notion of election comes up in the Bible, it's like, isn't God amazing? Cause he's unlimited. And how could he not pick? How could he not be sovereign and in control over all things, even if that's a little bit confusing and hard to drive with our minds is great. And here again, the idea of election just points out how much Jesus values the people who are in his presence right now, who God has given him and those who he was praying for in John 17, who will be future believers, who are gonna have to navigate this tricky thing. He loves his elect, he loves his sheep, he'd leave 99 behind to go and get after the one to figure out where they wandered off to. And he's saying some wolves are coming down the pike who are gonna come along when things are tremendously pressurized, when crazy stuff is going down, when everybody's world fields upside down and the things that people were counting on is being reliable, like the predictability of your money, the predictability of the justice of the government and the predictability of boundaries that we drew on a map one time with red lines that are impermeable and you can't go in there, you can't cross those things, the impermeability of what we expect to be a given lifespan that everybody should get, the impermeability of basic decency between neighbors. Though history has been volatile at times for the most part, people have had expectations, especially in modern history, of these certain realities being present and it would seem that Jesus is concerned that when that pressure gets turned up and all of these institutions, all of these things that we anchor ourselves to and feel are so predictable and reliable and give us a sense of stability when all these things get turned on their heads, this is gonna be really easy for somebody to come along and be like, I'm the leader you needed. Oh yeah, I know, your parents are 10 minutes late there, little fella, but your mom told me to come and pick you up in this van. The vulnerability isn't there, but if mom shows up when the kid imagined that mom was going to show up or is they conceived of what the afternoon ought to look like, the greater vulnerability occurs when the kid in that, I'm not trying to make light of it, very frightening situation is rattled and as a result, not thinking completely straight. We've talked here recently and over on the YouTube channel several months back about all of these rival messianic claimants that did come along prior to the time of Christ after the time of Christ. And it's interesting that Jesus is like, oh, look, these people are gonna show up and they're gonna be prophets that appear and they do things that look miraculous. And if anybody tells you, oh, they're out in the desert, go out and see them out there, come with me in the van, don't go because that's not where the Messiah is going to come from. And people in the original audience would have picked up on what he was referencing here. All these guys hit out in the desert because it made them harder to track down and to be punished or thwarted by the Romans. We talked about Judas, we talked about Simon of Korea, Throngees, Judas the Galilean. We talked about the Egyptian prophet, we talked about Theodists and I think a few others as well. Well, Barcocca in the early second century AD a little bit later on, what did they all do? Well, then when they hit out in cliffs, hit out in the desert, rallied things out there away from where the Roman legions were and away from where the religious leadership was, could shame them and discredit them because they wouldn't be able to keep up. And the well-educated religious elites would put to shame what seemed like pretty smart wisdom out in the desert with only a few people standing around who didn't know any better. By contrast, where is the son of man as he delivers these lines? He just got done walking into the lion's den and confronting all of the elites. He's standing when he has these exchanges over chapters, 21, 22 and 23, he's standing in the shadow of the Antonia fortress where the Roman legions hung out. He's standing in the shadow or even within the boundaries of the temple where the religious elites hung out. He made no secrets about who he was. He didn't put on a cloak and skulk around. He got to Jerusalem. He rode in on a donkey with people waving branches and yelling, Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. And then he went straight into the middle of the temple where everybody could see him flipped over a bunch of tables just in case somebody didn't know he was coming. He is the opposite of what people had come to expect to be normal behavior for one of these desert messiahs who comes and goes very quickly. So there's a jab here. There's a little bit of a healthy twist of the knife where Jesus is like, yeah, like remember, everybody chases after these things. They had like the fashionable YouTuber to go and listen to. You got Captain Hottake who yells things into a microphone on the internet. You got this athlete, you got that celebrity and everybody's so sure they know all the things. And it's the biggest deal for just a little while and it comes and it goes. That's gonna happen, but don't fall for it. And on that note, in my heart, I figured we'd just break this up into two parts, but I kinda wanna keep going. So we're gonna make it into the reparts and we're gonna finish out this run up to Jesus description of what the return of the Son of Man is going to look like in Matthew 24 next time around. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
