 So right after my wife and I got married, we moved into this attic apartment. It was our first place ever. And it was really fun. It was an interesting place to live and start out life together. Had these weird angled ceilings. And so even the person who was in that tall like me would have to hunch over to stand in front of the toilet or to do the dishes. But it was magical. It was great. We lived in Zion, Illinois. And we lived in a really diverse, really fun neighborhood. Got to know all the neighbors. And I went downstairs and I was in my backyard and goofing around down there. And the neighbor kid comes over, you know, kind of a pudgy kid, probably about 10 years old, full of energy, life, fun, goofy. And he's one to play. And I was like, sure, yeah, we can throw the ball around or whatever. I introduced myself. And I was like, well, what's your name, man? And he's like, my name's Kyle. I'm like, all right. And then he looks at me with this real like, I'm going to blow your mind. Kyle Puckett. And I was like, cool, Kyle Puckett. Nice to meet you. And he's like, that name mean anything to you? Like, well, yeah, I mean, there's the great Kirby Puckett. You have the same last name as him. He's like, that's my uncle. And I was like, dang, your uncle is awesome. He's great at baseball. That's really cool, man. And I let him tell me stories about Kirby Puckett. And I love being that kid's neighbor. But there was that moment where he dropped that name and he knew and the eye contact said so that that should mean something to me. That should carry some weight. And it did. Likewise, when we look at Matthew chapter 14 and this chapter that we're into about the grief that is inflicted on Jesus by the execution of John the Baptist and how he continues to be dependent on his father and how he continues to be compassionate toward others in the meantime, we get to this moment where he's fed the 5,000 and he sends the disciples off in a boat and he goes up on a mountainside to pray and be with his father. And then as the evening gives way to night, he looks out and the boats a long way from shore and all his pals are out there in the boat and the winds picked up and the boats being buffeted around and it's out of control. And then a little bit of time passes and the disciples are in the boat and they're no doubt really upset and concerned because of how the threat of drowning is very present. And then Jesus just strolls out to them on the lake. At least that's how the text holds it out as having happened. It says Matthew 14, 25, during the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. It's a ghost, they said and cried out in fear. So there's a quick reset. And then after that, we get the pocket is my last name moment. We get the thing that Jesus says that both to the people in the boat and to the original audience reading this document that Matthew wrote, the way Jesus says this is supposed to cause everybody to be like, whoa, wait a minute, I know that name. Verse 27, it says, but Jesus immediately said to them, take courage. It is I don't be afraid. There's no really tidy way to render this in English that has the same literary flow, but also theological effect that this would have in the original Greek. But the phrase it is I is literally ego, a me or I am. Now for some of you who are maybe newer to the Bible thing, you're like, Oh, cool. I am. Yeah. That's what people say when they are talking about themselves or how they're feeling. I am hungry. I am Matt, whatever. But for those of you who've been around the Bible a little longer, maybe that popped for you the way the last name pocket popped for me. I am. You know whose name that is? This is God's name. God revealed himself in the Old Testament. And when the question was thrown out, like, well, who should I say is sending me to do this? God replies, say that I am sent to you. And we've talked about this name of God before in some earlier episodes, but functionally I am. What a great name for God. The beginning and end, the Alpha and Omega, the maker and sustainer of all things. The one being that created the natural order as we know it, but also functions beyond the natural order, the one being who is qualified to come from outside the natural order into the natural order to redeem things in the natural order. I am. He is being. He is essence. All that is existence as we understand it is contained within the boundaries of the will and authority of that greatest being, a being greater than which no being can be imagined. It's a pretty crazy good name when you actually think about it. And there's a reason that Peter Quill's dad in the Marvel comic books and in Guardians of the Galaxy two, there's a reason his name is ego, ego. I guess they did the English pronunciation there. It's an acknowledgement to nod to this name that God chooses for himself, which really is the best name you could possibly conceive of for what God definitely must be. Now if we go over to the book of John, what we get are seven crystal clear. I am statements that correspond to things we know about the nature and the role and the work of God that are revealed throughout the course of the Old Testament. And John's structure is very much built around these seven very bold. I am statements of Jesus, which once again would have popped to the original audience the same way the last name, Puckett, would pop to a baseball fan in the late 1990s. And so if we were to do a quick 1500 episode, John through the gospel of John, like we're doing through the gospel of Matthew, I would constantly be pounding on this structure built around the seven I am statements in the same way that in Matthew, I'm always pounding this. Hey, look, it all fits into these five big speeches that Jesus gives. You got this one here and this one here and this one here. And this is a structural format that we can look at. But in Matthew, the I am thing is a little more subtle. The king thing is the greater point of emphasis, evoking the Old Testament motifs and prophecies about the Messiah and the way that God would ultimately step back into the world and redeem and resolve all of these things and bring about the culmination of his redemptive plan. That is not to say, however, that somehow dropping an I am in the middle of Matthew would just say, oh, bye everybody. And they'd be like, yeah, whatever. No, for sure. Everybody hearing this would have known what this claim is. And really what's going on here in the middle third of Matthew from the end of the sermon on the Mount on. The end of the sermon on the Mount. You remember in Matthew seven, it ends by saying when Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching because he taught his one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law. So the billion dollar question moving forward that comes up in literally every chapter we've looked at since the end of chapter seven is who is this guy? Because you really have the authority to deliver on all the stuff that he's saying on all of these claims. Does he have the power and authority over things to match the authority with which he speaks and teaches to match the way he comes off? And so all the miracles that we get in chapter eight are kind of an answer to that question. And then all of the stuff, the last time that we're on the lake in chapter eight and Jesus calms the storm, it raises the same question. Remember the disciples are like, wait, who is this that even the wind and the waves obey him? And there's a bunch more stuff that points to this over the next few chapters. But think about the cemetery here. This is so cool. In chapter eight, Jesus is in the boat with them. Remember he's sleeping and then the storm kicks up just like it does here. And he's like, yeah, I'm just going to rebuke the wind and the waves and they're going to go away. You remember King Xerxes tried that with the hellespont when he was trying to invade Greece and it didn't work here. Jesus demonstrates that he's not a clown king. He actually has authority. He actually can rebuke the wind and the waves and it works and it raises a question. You recall right after this, they get to the other side of the lake, the same place they're going right now on this journey in Matthew 14 and the demons that Jesus casts out over there, they know exactly who he is. Remember they say, what do you want with the son of God? So the question is lingering and it's pregnant, but the cemetery here is cool because the disciples ask the obvious question. Who is this guy during a storm that they're in the midst of here in chapter eight? And then what do you know? The next time they're in the middle of a storm here in chapter 14, they get their answer. What Jesus immediately said to them, take courage. It is I, ego, A.M.E. I.M. Don't be afraid that phrase, that name had insane currency with the guys on that boat. It had insane currency with the people of Galilee and Judea. It had insane currency with everybody who was reading this gospel of Matthew in its earliest form as it was being delivered to a Jewish audience and catered to a Jewish audience. This is a staggering reveal in the middle of a narrative where people have seen enough clues and hints and foreshadowing to be like, I think that's just God. Look at everything he does. I mean, look at the answer he gave John the Baptist disciples. He's like, all the things are supposed to happen. And the Messiah, the Christ shows up. They're all happening. People are probably connecting the dots by the time they get to chapter 14. But now dang, he said it and we're going to break down more about what it is and how it would have hit them and how it hit the guys in the boat next time around. Last thing, just as a heads up, I've been throwing some energy at continuing to move forward with my little Luke series over on the 10 minute Bible hour YouTube side. I just posted another one. We are in the middle of Luke chapter six. And there's a lot going on over there with the YouTube video series on Luke that I've been doing over the last few years that really corresponds to and fleshes out what we're doing here. So if you felt like it, you might enjoy going back and powering through that stuff. I don't know what we're at. There's like maybe 25 episodes over there, but I think they're fun. It'll benefit what we're working on here as well. If you have a chance to go and check that out, you might enjoy it. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
