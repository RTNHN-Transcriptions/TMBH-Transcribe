 Okay, now that is a chemical in Turkey, I think it's called trip to fan. I always want to say trip to con, but that's an impugiant decepticon. It's trip to fan 100% sure you and I have already verified this together. And it's I don't know. It's some kind of chemical. It's supposed to make you tired. I don't know if that's a real thing or some bold wives tale or something. That's what they always said. And so whenever you have Thanksgiving dinner or if you eat turkey for Christmas dinner, that's the rumors that that's why you always got to go and take a nap. Whatever the case, it sure looks like in Matthew chapter 26, the disciples might have had some of that trip to con stuff in their system because they want to shut it down real, real bad after their big holiday meal. And it just kind of feeds into this whole theme we were talking about yesterday of abandonment that Jesus is experiencing that he's really tackling this thing on his own. And this thing is a pretty brutal thing to tackle on his own. But I think I mean, like the whole wrongly and unjustly be arrested after being betrayed by one of your friends and then turned over to authorities who you actually have authority over, but you willfully submit to their unjust wrong judgment anyway. And then you go and get executed in a humiliating way in front of everybody and you die. That's the thing. I mean, that he's having to face on his own. All right. Let's look at this sleepy post meal disciple situation we got going. All right. He's going to be sick. Jesus is like you all are going to betray me. Here's even a Bible verse, Zechariah. And then Peter's like, no, I'm totally not going to do that. And he's like, yeah, you totally are. And so they go to get semi, which is a place that we're going to talk about tomorrow in terms of the geography of all of that. There's some really interesting stuff we're going to look at in terms of even this, uh, this super ancient travel itinerary from a pilgrim in the fourth century who went and will learn from him what was still there at the site of get semi that's going to be fun with us tomorrow. And so Jesus says to his disciples, sit here while I go over there and pray. So we're somewhere in this presumably olive grove and it's probably pretty tame and pretty quiet there because of, you know, it's not really time when everybody's doing work. This is a time when you're celebrating this holiday. I'm sure it was very tranquil and he takes Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, James and John, same three guys who went up for the transfiguration along with him and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. And he said to them, my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me. So he's overwhelmed and this is visible and evident to you. Have you ever been with a friend who was despondent? Maybe despondent is too strong a word to describe where Jesus is. He's facing death and abandonment. I mean, you can tell when your buddy, when your sister, when your dear friend, when your family members kind of having an off day and it's not great. They're dealing with maybe general malaise. You have a sense of what to do and how to be supportive and what might be too much and maybe even a little bit enabling and you navigate that. But you also know there's a next level that you need to kick it into when somebody is in the throes of it, when they are really facing something, really dealing with something. One of the first things you want to do to show them that you're taking it seriously, for example, is turn off your stupid phone. But I can even think of examples of times where somebody was really starting to pour things out to me and I didn't register it right away and I still had my phone up. I cring, cring, cring, maybe I'm sending a text or maybe I'm still scrolling something that I was already scrolling when they started to talk and I'm like, uh huh. Oh, wow. Oh, that's tough. How'd that make you feel? Oh, uh huh. It's gross. So I know what it feels like to be on the giving end receiving end of that not understanding the severity of the situation kind of relational moment. I also know what it's like to be on the giving and receiving end of when somebody spells out what they're dealing with and you get it and you really have that moment of connection and shared burden over this very difficult thing. Well, Jesus is not getting that here even though he specifically asks for it. My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. That's a big one, folks. Somebody says that to you, especially somebody like Jesus who's never said anything like that before. This dude has not been victimy. This dude has a strong identity and sense of character and self. He's not one who can't think of how to get people's attention. And so it just falls back into overly dramatic statements about victimhood and emotional swings to try and create some sort of artificial sense of connection that they can only feel when somebody feels bad and sad for them. That personality disorder, that frailty in our character exists. It can get the best of all of us, but that ain't what's happening here. Jesus has never played this card before. And he says this to his inferiors. He's the master. They're the students. He says this. Like, I'm overwhelmed. He uses that word. Remember, he's saying this to the guys who were freaking out on a boat because they were all going to drown on water. They were very familiar with and he got up and he's like, well, he's so worried about stuff. He's saying this as the guy who was like, you know, don't don't worry about tomorrow. Like tomorrow's got enough worries of its own. I look at, look at how the birds in the air and the lilies of the field are all taken care of. God knows what to do with all of that stuff. That is the guy who's saying that he's overwhelmed to the point of death. And then he asks them for something. We're command. So I think it's okay to say that. He says, stay here and keep watch with me. I don't want to be alone. I'm overwhelmed to the point of death and I want you here with me. What are we keeping watch for here? Exactly. Well, I suppose one way to look at Jesus's request or instruction here would be to say like, well, we're keeping watch, you know, for somebody might want to come and arrest me because you guys notice that Judas isn't here. And you remember what I said back at the meal? Like, we need to be eyes up here and I need some time, but I need you to be my eyes and be watching my back. It could be that. But it seems like he also knows that he's walking into this trap. He could have stopped Judas back at the meal when he called him out for what he was going to do if he didn't want to get arrested right now. But unlike the other times in the past where people crush in on him and want to throw him off a cliff and he's like, yeah, not now. And then he uses some kind of like Jesus trick thing to like just walk right through the crowd and not get thrown off of a cliff or killed because it just wasn't his time. He's not doing that here. He's walking head long into this situation like a Gus Ferat headbutt celebration with a wall. So I don't think he's asking them to keep watch because he wants defensive measures or centuries posted. I think this is more in keeping with the stuff that Jesus has been saying all along about being eyes up. Look at the situation guys. Look at look around. Look at the harvest field. It's white and it's ready to go. Everything's ready to be harvested. But we got to pray to the Lord of the harvest. It will raise up workers who go out into the harvest field. Remember that that's an eyes up be attentive. Read the room. Look at the situation type of command from Jesus. What about the stuff about you guys? You're wicked and perverse generation. You demand a sign, but the signs are perfectly evident. You won't get any more than this. Or what about the stuff about like you read sky at night. Sailor's delight read sky at morning. Sailors take warning. I don't know if I got that one exactly right. I used to know it. And the idea is you can read the weather, be eyes up and read the signs of the times. Look at what is going on around you. This is it. You don't want to miss it. And so often when Jesus gives those instructions toward alertness, it would seem like the application point of those instructions is just be aware. Be ready. See it. Be ready. Heck, think about the stuff that was just a couple pages earlier here in the whole Olivet Discourse. There really wasn't a lot of instruction there about what you do as much as it's an orientation toward readiness. And that is what getting it looks like in terms of the kingdom story, the kingdom value of how history and how things are going to unfold. And so he's trained and equipped to these guys a whole bunch to be like, hey, this is where we're going. This is what we're doing. And now he's like, stay here and keep watch with me. Well, those are trigger words falling back on all those things that I just referenced. Going a little farther, he fell on his face to the ground and prayed, my father, if it's possible, may this cup be taken from me yet not as I will, but as you will. Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He says, could you not keep watch with me for one hour? He asked Peter, watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body's weak. He went away a second time and prayed, my father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done more on what he's praying here in a future conversation. But for now we're working on the sleepy stuff. When he came back, he again found them sleeping because our eyes were heavy. So we left them and went away once more and prayed a third time saying the same thing. Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, are you still sleeping? So it sounds like three times they dozed off after he came and engaged with them. Now to somebody who hasn't read through the text before, you're going to be like, oh, that goes back to what Jesus said just a few verses earlier before all the praying and sleeping stuff started. Peter says, well, even if I'll follow an account of you, I never will. And then Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This very night before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times. It's a faint, like F E I N T, not like faint, like pass out. It's a fake. It's a, it's a trick. You're meant as the reader the first time through to be like, Oh, wow, that's the worst betrayal. Jesus is going to have perpetrated against him by Peter. He fell asleep three times before morning. What happens at morning? Well, the rooster crows, there it is right there. He couldn't even stay awake. He couldn't even watch and be it his master's side attentively during this difficult time. But now we know that the real betrayal happens later and this one looks pretty mild by comparison. It all fits into that theme of abandonment. And Jesus is going to have to go this thing alone. But also it speaks to how unready the disciples are at the end of this prayer time that they're sleeping through. Jesus is going to be arrested and this is the last time in this lifetime of Jesus that they are going to be together. That was it. And they didn't even think about that. I saw a little thing on Twitter the other day. It showed all the boys from the sandlot. And it's like, nobody realized the last time that you went out with all of your friends in the neighborhood to play that it would be the last time you ever all went out with all of your friends in the neighborhood to play. And it made me feel very, very sad. That one, that one got me. I didn't deliver it very well to you just now. But it hit me the right way. All of this to say, the disciples just failed a test. And that's disheartening and it's a pity and it plays into the abandonment narrative that we are seeing here from Jesus perspective. Apparently more still needs to happen before they are ready to fulfill the open world quest that Jesus commissioned them for all the way back in chapter 10. We'll see how that plays out moving forward. Hey, do you catch that a little bit of bonus music or new music at the beginning back there? That was from that new album that is coming out in August that Jeff and I have been working on. Jeff is the mastermind. Jeff is the talent. I help some a little bit here and there. That's a good way to describe it. But our project together is called Rook Town and the album is going to be called the clamor and the crash. And I think here in just a second, I'm going to have Jeff play just a little bit more of, I guess, what you would call the second single. That sounds way too formal for what we are. A couple of guys goofing around with music in the basement. But I'm really proud of it. I think it's genuinely a super cool album that goes to very interesting places and does things that albums don't do very much anymore. It's all one cohesive thing dealing with cohesive stuff and all of it ties into the Ironwood Rhino podcast, which I do elsewhere. You may be listened to it. Maybe you haven't. But it also ties into conversations that we have been having here. There's stuff, for example, about the Olivet Discourse that factors directly into what we're doing in one particular song on the album. At any rate, what would be awesome and a huge help would be if you would consider supporting particularly Jeff by going to RookTown.net and maybe consider signing up for the email newsletter that he's going to do. I think he's going to post new music every month that will go first and even exclusively to members of that email list. And then if you want to check it out on Spotify or watch the YouTube video that's over there at RookTown.net, you can do that. However, everyone who supports the podcast at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast, you should check your email because as soon as I stop recording right here, I'm going to walk over and forward the new single to you single. It sounds so formal and fancy. But the new song that we're releasing from the album is called Get It Right Tonight. And I think it's really super good. So we'll play just a little bit more of that on the way out the door. And then I'm going to make an mp3 copy of that song available to all of the patrons who support at any level at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast. Nice job, Jeff. Good music. Thanks for letting me help a teeny tiny little bit. I hope you enjoy a bit more of the song. Thank you for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. For this moment, we can get it right.
