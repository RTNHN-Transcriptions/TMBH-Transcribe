 I tell you what, years from now, it's going to be really difficult for people to look back on this era in history and really nail down what team thought what, who the tribes were, what their opinions are. It feels like to you and me as we poke around on social media and Twitter and whatnot, we're like, oh yeah, we get where everybody stands and this is definitely a dog whistle for that opinion and people who think this, my abs are litmus tests. They always also think this, this, this and this and we think we get it. But that is a very temporary getting it because stuff moves so quick stuff shifts so quickly. You look at the opinions that have surrounded the last couple of years as I record this regarding the pandemic, man stuff that was dead wrong a year ago is now dead right today. And if you thought it a year ago, you were on one political team, but if you think the exact same thing now, well, then you're actually on the other political team. So if people 2000 years from now want to look back on this moment and really pin down who thought what man they had better be very precise as to exactly when they were talking about. So when we talk about the political parties in play during the time of Christ, whether it's one of these super minority parties like the Herodians who barely come up at all, but who did come up in Matthew 22, whether you're talking about one of those little parties like the Herodians or the big boy party, that being the Pharisees. Anytime you come out and say, man, this is how they were the immediate responsible follow up question to that statement should be, yeah, but when because it did change, you get the Pharisees. They're the biggest, the second biggest would be the Sadducees who we're going to talk more about today. And then the, I don't know quite what to do with these two group parties would be the Essenes. These are probably the people responsible for the settlement at Qumran where the bulk of the Dead Sea Scrolls and specifically, obviously the Qumran collection was discovered back in the middle of the 20th century. And then you've got the zealots. One of the members of the zealot party got recruited by Jesus to be part of his inner circle and the zealots as best as we can tell really wanted to get rid of all the political presence of outsiders and they were pretty revolutionary minded and probably seen as maybe a little bit extreme by most folks. Well, the Pharisees come up all the time. So we've talked about what they think quite a bit. They believed that there was some kind of resurrection coming. They believed that there was a promised Messiah that God was not done fulfilling his promises to Israel and that there was a whole gigantic unfolding still coming down the pike and we have got scads of historical evidence and support for who the Pharisees were and what they thought in part because they were the most popular party and in part and probably related to that previous point because a ton of what they wrote survives. So we learn about the Pharisees by reading things that Pharisees wrote. We learn about the Sadducees, however, by reading things written by people who didn't like the Sadducees. Their stuff to the best of my knowledge does not survive. We know the names of some of the things that the Sadducees wrote. They had some special book that they used as a resource for how they handled their religious judgments, their legal judgments, et cetera. But oh man, I just repositioned that mic. Does that sound way better to you? Because that sounds way better to me. You can just enjoy that transition right there. Well, the reason that I'm bringing up the Sadducees and getting a little bit ahead of myself here is because they are the next group to step up to the carnival game and see if they can knock over the pins and claim the prize of defeating Jesus. The fancy Pharisees tried it, then the Pharisees sent out their younglings along with the Herodians and they all get embarrassed. So another political party is like, why don't we take a try at it? And that's exactly what happens in verse 23, which I think would have read comically to the original audience who knew this stuff. Jesus just got done shutting down the whole pay taxes, the Caesar thing by saying give to Caesar what is Caesarism and give to God what is God's and everybody walks away and they're all astonished, very next verse. That same day, the Sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him with a question. We'll get into what that question is next time around. The reason I think this would have been comical is because this would be like a thing where a guy goes out on the street corner and that morning, the Republicans came up to him and we're like, Hey, do you understand that what you're saying is causing problems around here for local business? And then the person on the street corner says something real brilliant and they look stupid in the crowds like the person on the street corner more. So later that day, the campus young Republicans and several Antifa members come up to the guy on the street corner and they're like, Hey, well, maybe you could help us out with a question that we as close personal friends totally wrestle with together when we get together and hang out, which we definitely totally do all the time because of all the things we agree upon so much and because of how much we just really like constructive dialogue and thinking about the world and ideas together. Maybe you could answer this question for us. And then the guy on the street corner is like, Oh, yeah, I see what you're doing. So here's two sentences and I think that'll dismiss this false front that you guys are putting forward and they all hang their heads and walk away feeling dumb. And then right after that, the local Democratic leaders come up and they're like, well, we represent the Democrat party and we have some concerns about making bathroom use more flexible and increasing taxes on certain people. And we'd like to talk to you about that. Look, I tried to just pick things that would be kind of safe there and that would be generally reflective of the interests of those parties. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to jab anything in particular. What I am trying to say is you get how weird that is. There's nothing happening in society right now where all of the different people from the political corners would come up one at a time to try to address a problem that's a thumb in the eye to just everybody. It doesn't happen. Everything shakes out into this binary ideological way. And overwhelmingly that was kind of it here too. Yeah. So a couple of different binary spectrums, one of which would have been a general attitude of appeasement toward the occupying government and that occupying government's culture. The other, which would have been more of a rejectionist mindset of the occupation of the government and the culture, then there would have been another spectrum here as well that would have been more of a behavioral conservatism represented by the Pharisees who were a little more hardcore on the individual behavioral rules versus more lax behaviorism, which would have been the case with the Sadducees. So on all of these things, you got the same spectrums, the same way that we got a whole bunch of spectrums on our political ideas and ways that things shake out generally one and zero. So I know there are a bunch of parties we've talked about, but all of them could be neatly identified on that spectrum in one way or the other. So it just would have been laughable to the original audience as well as really head scratching. Who could push the buttons of all of these people at once and how can not one of these groups co-opt this guy's popularity on this street corner to weaponize it in favor of their thing and to demonize the other group? I mean, this is what we do with everything. We co-opt it and cram it into one of these two categories and Jesus seems to be absolutely uncramable. And Matthew punctuates this humor a little bit by immediately identifying the Sadducees as the people who say there's no resurrection. Now, my guess is that since he's writing to a Jewish audience, they all know that, right? Like, you know, the basic tenants, especially the main identifying one or two tenants of the big political parties wherever you live, I'm sure. Wouldn't the original audience have been pretty clear on who the Sadducees were and what they were about? Why did he include this detail? Well, I think he's reminding us of what an odd impromptu coalition this is of people coming up to take swings at Jesus. I also think he's pointing this out because of the nature of the question that they're about to ask him, which has a whole lot to do with eternal life. And they seem terribly concerned in the question we're going to look at in the coming days about what happens to someone when they die and how that all shakes out in eternity. They're making a mockery of it with a disingenuous question the same way Jesus just got done dealing with a disingenuous question about the whole taxes to Caesar things. So what this also would have implicitly demonstrated to the original audience is that pretty much everybody we're talking to here has put all of their hope in this political party's vision to solve our problems or that other political parties vision to solve all of our problems. But look at how similar and impotent those two political parties that almost every one of you in the original audience believes is going to be the key to your deliverance. Look how impotent and similar in the manner of their impotence. Both of these groups actually are. All right, we got a little ways into talking about the sadgeseed thing, but we're going to do another one of those history deep dives in our next conversation to get into more of what we actually specifically know about them. And we're going to look at some primary source material about the Sadducees as well. So we get a really good sense of how the original audience would have thought about these guys and we can ring more of the meaning out of the upcoming passage we have in this showdown between the Sadducees and Jesus standing alone on a street corner handling his business against all of the most impressive powerful groups of people that could come at him. All right, we're going to hit pause there. Oh, no, we're not. Hey, a couple of you jumped in like just over the last week, like three or four people as new patrons. My goodness, that is encouraging. Thank you for doing that. Do anybody who doesn't support like don't take this as weird pressure. You don't have to. It's the internet. It's free. I love doing this thing at the same time. It's just a huge help to have that support and a huge encouragement to have that support. So thanks to everybody who does support the program at patreon.com slash the TMVH podcast. Thank you. I appreciate you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
