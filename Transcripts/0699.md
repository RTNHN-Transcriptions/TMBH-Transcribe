 We're Matthew chapter 26 and we're looking at the trial of Jesus at the house of Caiaphas. And there's a question that comes to mind as we get to the high point of really the whole book of Matthew so far, which is the point where the high priest Caiaphas says to Jesus, I charge you under oath by the living God. Tell us if you're the Christ, the Son of God. And then Jesus says, yep, it is as you say. And then he doubles and triples down on it going on to say, but I say to all of you, in the future, you'll see the son of man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, he has spoken blasphemy. Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you've heard the blasphemy. What do you think? Can you say that to the room full of other religious leaders? And they say he is worthy of death. If you're alive in this day and age, you can appreciate deep, deep, deep division and reading a thing deeply, deeply, deeply, differently. But here we go to a lot of new levels as we try to evaluate this debate, this controversy between these two parties. They're trying to occupy the same space. So it makes sense that they were going to come into collision. The high priest is a state appointed mediator between God and man. Rome, fair and square, conquered Israel and made them a subject state. And now I guess fair and square Roman governors who kind of vaguely know a little bit sort of about Judea and Judaism and God, they just appoint a high priest. There's some financial considerations involved, but you know, that's how government works. So on the one hand, you got that mediator between God and man. And on the other hand, you have one who no government backs at all. In fact, there's been no paperwork to sign off on Jesus at all. There's been no formal hearings. There is no institution standing behind him. He is quite literally a nomadic wandering homeless guy with a ragtag, unlikely motley crew of dudes following him around. He has no army. He has basically no money. His credibility comes only from who he is, what he says and what he does and the fact that he looks sort of like the perfect fit for the Old Testament notion of Messiah that theoretically is the character that all the Jewish people have been looking forward to this whole time. So you got two mediators between God and men. And of course they had to end up on a collision course. As we've discussed, now the collision course has come to the point of collision and Jesus ain't backing down. He's not really picking a fight either. He's just saying the thing that is true and outrage ensues. Look, if you haven't figured out my biases yet, let me just disclose a couple of them here. I think Jesus is the good guy in this story. I'm sympathetic to his point of view. I think he comes off as the more credible character. I think the Pharisees come off as really relatively lousy and dishonest. But I mean, let's be honest, the Book of Matthew, it's a little bit biased toward Jesus as well. So in this conversation, I want to do something that we've done several times over the course of our however many hundred episodes on the Book of Matthew, which is try to be empathetic to the position of Jesus' enemies. Why and how could they look at Jesus knowing that a Messiah is supposed to come and determine with certainty, you ain't it. And if you say you are, we are going to kill you. Say it. Say it. Aderia. Say it. Say you are. Say you're the Messiah. We know you're not the right one, but we will kill. We go, he said it. Tear the robes, haul him off, kill the dude. How could they miss that? How could they respond like that? Why wouldn't they even consider that maybe he actually is the Messiah? Well, there's no New Testament at this point. So all we got is Old Testament. And if we take a wide, broad look at the whole thing, we got to admit that the idea of a Messiah in the earliest parts of the Old Testament, both chronologically and the way the books were arranged for them and the way the books are arranged for us, it's more subtle. It's a nod. It's a hint. It's the kind of thing that's meant to make you think or suspect, but later it'll make more sense in the rear view mirror. I don't know if these religious leaders would go back to Genesis chapter three, but with the convenience and ease of hindsight and being raised around Christianity and a Christian era with the New Testament in place, a luxury that the Pharisees did not have, I can go back to Genesis three, like a whole bunch of much smarter people before me and be like, whoa, this interaction here where God issues his judgments for the fall, it looks like it points to Jesus and his ability to ultimately defeat sin and death. It pops up right here in Genesis chapter three with what God says to the woman who participated in the sin. Then the Lord God said to the woman, what is this you've done? The woman said the serpent deceived me and I ate. And now God starts talking to the serpent because you've done this, cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals. You'll crawl on your belly and you'll eat dust all the days of your life. And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers. He will crush your head and you will strike his heel. Okay, you caught it, right? It sounds like what's being said is that there is going to be this offspring who will come from the woman that gets clarified in the book of Romans, like very much Paul is connecting these words to Jesus of Nazareth. And it doesn't seem like a stretch at all. But clearly God is saying there is going to be this offspring and this offspring is going to crush your head even as you strike at his heel. That squares with the duel that we're seeing in the book of Matthew. Remember Matthew chapter four has the famous account of the temptation out in the desert who shows up the serpent who later in the Old Testament we come to rightly associate with Satan with Lucifer with the Prince of Evil, the enemy, the one who wants to advance the causes of sin and death and damage and destruction and chaos to the plans of God. The enemy of the kingdom of God and the redemptive work of God. And so in Matthew, we see that dual play out is Jesus really fighting against the religious leaders or is he fighting against some unseen enemy who isn't flesh and blood, but it's some larger, more dominant, more ancient spirit with personality and agency who is actively trying to thwart the plans of God. Well, it certainly looks like the latter. So again, with 2020 hindsight and clarity and the benefit of having the New Testament, it's really easy for me to be like, wow, I think the Pharisees and chaiaphas and the religious leaders, even if they were appointed as stooges of an invading government should have been able to look back on this and be like, I kind of points to stuff in the future. And further, they should have been able to look back on that and see that there was a grand redemptive plan and that the Messiah was the centerpiece of it by flipping a little bit ahead in the book of Genesis and coming to understand the deal that God is making with Abram with Abraham and how that deal involves God making a people out of his descendants and that God is going to bless those people, but also that his descendants are going to be a blessing to all the nations. There's this idea that redemption will go beyond the descendants of Abraham and we get more clarity as to how that redemption would need to look as we get a sense of the Mosaic law in the book of Exodus as the Hebrew people are leaving Egypt and we're gradually getting more and more of a sense of the law. And then in Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy, we get a sense of God's character based on the law that he reveals and what he thinks about justice and his righteous judgment, but also the character of his grace and his mercy is on display and the whole thing just begs for fulfillment, for completion, for a sacrifice that would be perfect and flawless for all time. Not one that is limited and merely stays the righteous judgment of God for a moment. Then we get a little bit further into first and second Samuel, first and second Kings. And now we're past kind of this primitive age and the history of Israel and now we're getting into the age of Kings and these books are fraught with the normal perils of government going to government world kingdom going to world kingdom. But in there somewhere, David's like, wow, I am a train wreck of a person at times, but you are the one true king. You are the great God and I want to build you a place to dwell among us. I'm going to build you a great temple and God's like, cool, great. I'm actually going to have your kid do that, but I have a blessing for you, David. And he makes the promise about this eternal king who will reign on an eternal throne that will be descended from David. That's obviously Messianic language. Then as you get a little bit further into the second half as we have it organized of the Old Testament, you start to get into the Psalms, which have all kinds of stuff about the Messiah. We've looked particularly at Psalm 110, but there's a whole bunch of business in Psalm 22 in particular that deals with the circumstances of the crucifixion as it's coming up here in just a minute. And then as you get past the Psalms, you get into all the things we've spent so much time looking at in major and minor prophets. In Daniel, we hear about this anointed one, this Messiah as it's rendered in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament that was in circulation at the time of Christ and that so much of the New Testament quotes from that's called the Septuagint as a side note. And this idea of the Messiah, it's not subtle. Even though the word is only used maybe 50-ish times in the Old Testament, the principle is all over the place. That all of this story, the law, the prophets, all of history is begging for this completion to the story. This king who fulfills the notion of king, the potential of kingship in the right way, this kingdom that fulfills the potential of nobility and rightness and justice and mercy that is inherent in the notion of kingdom. All of these things are unachievable by human effort, but achievable if an eternal undying great flawless, right, fully just, fully merciful king were to come along. And that's so much of what the Messiah is about in the Old Testament. So in Isaiah 53 in particular, I mean, there's stuff about Jesus' birth in Isaiah as well. In Zechariah, particularly chapters 11, 12 and 13, we looked at a whole bunch of that in Ezekiel in Daniel with all of the stuff about the Son of Man, the anointed one, the Messiah. Like the great Roy Kent. It's here. It's there. It's everywhere. And so on the one hand with the benefit again of hindsight, I just don't see how they missed it. But on the other hand, with the not benefit of hindsight, there had been a lot of messianic claimants. They no longer really had their eye on the ball of let's hold out and wait for there to be a Messiah. They'd kind of moved on from that mentality in terms of the Roman cooperating religious leadership and it moved more toward nobody's coming to save us. We are going to need to take matters into our own hands. We are going to need to get back to a level of national righteousness so we can keep this new temple we have and not have it get destroyed by some future Nebuchadnezzar, the guy who destroyed the first temple. And I ain't trying to be mean, but just based on the process by which Anas and Caiaphas and this leadership class was chosen in general, I don't believe in the quality or reliability of whatever matrices were used to pick them. I think what happened here was you had a self proliferating, deeply compromised religious leadership class who hired other deeply compromised people. The same way you cannot clean up government the size of the government in our country or in most Western nations at this point. The establishment is set in deep and so there will be a proliferation of people who are willing to have that sort of damocles hanging over their head that compromised nature of leadership and it's very difficult to get any kind of momentum for things that are coming from a different value base coming from a different set of assumptions than the one that is toxisified and poisoned simply by the process by which people were picked bastardized by the ick of the state. And so I just frankly don't believe and I'm not convinced that these were the best leaders. I don't think these were the best guys. I think there probably were people running around like Simeon and Anna who were there in the early going with Jesus and who'd been looking for the Messiah for a long time. I think there were people who had their head screwed on straight who were reading the Old Testament who saw how Jesus ticked all the boxes and was clearly the Messiah. I think there were people whose eyes were opened the same way the eyes of Peter were open. It was revealed to him by God. I think there were people who knew and who got it and who would have been qualified for leadership but would never ever even be considered for leadership in this way because of the culture that was in place and the really anti-messianic mindset that was in place at this time. And I think they'd become so obsessed with world kingdom metrics and world kingdom successes that they were no longer thinking in kingdom, kingdom categories. And when the actual king comes along who's all about kingdom, kingdom stuff, they're just going to miss it. Getting neck deep in a culture that's missing the point can have that effect on us, all of us. So I feel empathy and patience with them. Also, I think they were wrong. I'm Matt.
