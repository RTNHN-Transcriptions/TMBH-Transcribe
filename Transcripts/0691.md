 that that was watching the guy or the other day with my kids is the only channel that we can get on the TV at the cabin we're standing for our all getaway MacGyver is a program that was on was a kid an actor in it think his name was Richard Dean Anderson a real gentle face in the midst of nice guy was a nice show see in use a gun he wasn't really a detective or a crime fighter in fact I'm not totally sure what he did but I know that everybody called him by his name multiple times in every single conversation I know that he often wore stonewashed jeans with a belt and a bright white sweatshirt tucked in to those stonewashed jeans used his brain to solve problems and so while the thugs and baddies are using guns MacGyver would just come up with an overly elaborate solution to stuff and they need to feed the people who had the firearms and whatnot doesn't seem entirely plausible given the effectiveness of firearms but you know it was fun suspension disbelief what I'm like we had fun with it is a nice time watching the show that was a glimpse into a more innocent time with my kids and there is a fugitive in this episode he's a spoiled trust fund brat he's gonna murder somebody to cover his tracks and so he starts some shenanigans he's out driving around in his car with a license plate and everybody's trying to find them but they can't and then he breaks into a place by jumping over a fence and that's it and then he goes to a really pricey house and he just prize open a door with a crowbar and goes right in and that's all of it I just thought wow that's not really how crime works anymore I got databases and drones and Chinese social credit score apps disguised as social media and you just can't really go anywhere like that you're gonna get found real real quick just because your electronic signature and because your face kind of getting towards some kind of dystopian minority report stuff but then right after that I was working on some other stuff some super old history stuff and there's this great anecdote about the possibility that some legendary king from a long time ago that we'll talk about some other day died and got replaced by somebody who was impersonating him but nobody knew because nobody was close enough to the king so they couldn't tell just in the same week encountering those two stories I was reminded that like it's really a very recent phenomenon that we know what everybody looks like and that we can be like hey you're that lady aren't you back then there was a lot of possibility for sneaking around and doing spy stuff disguising yourself going places you weren't supposed to be and in Matthew 26 Peter is going to take a run at taking advantage of that opportunity that was afforded in the pre-electronic age because he is still of a mind to follow Jesus now look I don't know what Peter is thinking at this point because earlier in Matthew chapter 26 even though Matthew doesn't name Peter specifically we know it was Peter because all of this stuff about the arrest and the end of Jesus life it's in all the gospel so we can compare notes on all we know it was Peter it was Peter and character wise even if we didn't know it was Peter we know it was Peter so Jesus is going to get arrested and Peter gets out of sword and he's like I'm going to stab ears I'll show you and take on the whole world just stab in ears and so he does and Jesus like we're not knock it off we're not doing any of that live by the sword die by the sword all of that stuff that we talked about before you think about it like just run through it in your brain the whole story like okay then Jesus gets arrested he gets hauled away somewhere where does everybody else go I mean it says that they fled and it says that you know as a reference to the the zechariah thing that we looked at about how the shepherd's going to get struck and the sheep are going to scatter but where did they scatter to and what would Peter do well what Peter ends up doing is perfectly in keeping with his character verse 57 is right after the arrest but then all the disciples deserted him and fled now 57 those who arrested Jesus took him to Kiyephas the high priest where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled we talked about Kiyephas a whole bunch good on that but Peter followed him at a distance right up to the courtyard of the high priest he entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome it gets just Peter and he still looks like a Galilean he's probably still dressed like a Galilean but I guess there's a lot of hubbub but you also got to figure like what kind of hubbub what kind of chaos or noise or bustling is Peter the clumsy spy trying to take advantage of here well if it was a normal night at the house of Kiyephas he's not going to get away with any of this there's just not going to be enough chaos for him to blend in but Peter seems crafty and opportunistic he knows how to read the weather and read the water and be like you know what I can outsmart my prey by going right over here with this net and you got to be clever to be a fisherman so maybe you're supplying some of those skills and he's like hey we got chaos going on at the house of Kiyephas and I might be able to just blend in keeping eye on things does Peter still have his sword I don't know I would have to guess that he was dispossessed of that after he used it on somebody's ear but maybe he just picked it up or maybe that's why we needed to have two swords and he was like hey other simons I'm in the zealot I need I need remember that other sword from before the dinner I need that no reason no I just uh no reason thank you so I don't know maybe Peter's got a sword maybe he's milling around in here still insistent that he's going to use some sort of force or violence to protect Jesus maybe finally now he's given himself over to the reality that this is going to happen but either way he loves Jesus this is his master it's his friend he sold out everything he dropped his nets to go and follow this guy he is all in and unashamedly all in he metaphorically and literally stepped out of the boat and Jesus alone has the words of life where else would Peter go so here Peter is trying to blend in and counting on the fact that nobody is going to know what he looks like to get away with it now enough chaos has happened that maybe Peter totally forgot about that whole you're going to deny me three times deal that Jesus said back in Matthew 2634 maybe it's still on his mind and he's all clinched and puckered up and he's like I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it and it's all he's thinking about and he's doing his very very best but it's like you know when you go snowboarding and you look at the tree you hit the tree if you don't look at the tree you don't hit the tree you remember the analogy maybe Peter's just staring down the tree too much here I don't know what's going on in his head this is a very chaotic time it's very difficult for him but you got to salute the guy's boldness even if he has really no plan here for making the trip well if we look at the Matthew account we would get the impression that Peter went alone and that this trial this thing that's happening under cover of darkness late at night like remember this isn't in the temple courts it's still dark out and all of this is happening at a time when all of the people of the city who like Jesus so much are you know there's someone bed they're maybe just starting to make preparations for the day but this beginning of a trial it's not happening in an official capacity it's happening effectively behind closed doors it's happening at Kiafis' house and we know that not from marker Luke both of whom read just about like Matthew but we know that check that does Luke give us that I think Luke maybe does give us that detail what would this be 22 now I want to know okay all right Peter's okay denial it'd be about right there yeah Luke 22 54 then seizing him him being Jesus they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest Peter followed at a distance and you go over to John though and we fill in a few more details here that I think are really interesting but understandably not particularly relevant to Matthew over in John we got okay they came there arrested Jesus they bound him and brought him John 1813 first to Anas who was the father-in-law of Kiafis the high priest that year again we broke all of the Anas Kiafis stuff down if you don't remember that you can go listen to the last few episodes those guys just like the text says here they're related stool pigeons appointees of the governor of Judea for a very long period of time the Anas Kiafis era of the high priesthood is something that went on for a long time and Kiafis of course he's the state appointed mediator he's the world system appointed mediator between God and man and Jesus is the God appointed mediator between God and man so this is going to be weird Kiafis was the one who advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people more on that later Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus because this disciple was known to the high priest he went with Jesus into the high priest courtyard but Peter had to wait outside at the door the other disciple who was known to the high priest came back spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in okay so we get a little bit more the picture here of what Peter's plan looks like and how this all unfolded anytime John talks about an anonymous disciple he means him the disciple that the high priest knew is John John was from a family of some influence some finances looks like John's family maybe held property in the north and in the Jerusalem itself that'll come up as we get further into the text at some point i'm sure and so John is using his privilege here to gain access but Peter has to wait outside that's really interesting because you kind of think that maybe Kiafis would know John is associated with Jesus does he know that i mean as he talks to John's family is he in the loop on all of that and Kiafis is still like just okay with two of Jesus disciples being around maybe but the response of the other people that we're going to look at later in Matthew 26 and that comes next in John 18 indicates that it wasn't broadcast i mean Peter's trying to hide his identity he's willing to lie about his associations with Jesus so there's a little bit of a curiosity there as to how John's access to the house didn't betray John and Peter's relationship with Jesus but did get Peter access maybe John was the same age as that girl that he was talking to and they were pals from school or something and so he was able to pull a few strings without betraying anything i don't know what i do know is that it looks like Matthew isn't interested in giving us the detail about first speaking with Anis because well even according to John it doesn't look like really much of anything happened in the conversation with the old high priest it looks like it picks up right back with the new high priest the current high priest Kiafis as the narrative moves along in John 18 and that corresponds to what we're getting over here in Matthew chapter 26 so now you're getting one of those big dramatic act three sequences like you get in all the Star Wars movies where two bits of action or sometimes three are unfolding at once you got a battle in space and Han and Leia they got to get that shield generator down and also you got Luke on the bridge there the death star having a showdown with the darker side of himself and his father and the emperor and we're bouncing between all of those scenes we're getting that now we're inside Jesus is about to get a little bit roughed up he's being questioned harshly we got the big show down there between these two superpowers and outside we've got drama about what's going to happen to Peter who is sneaking probably with sneaky spy music going in the background but he's just too hamfisted and clumsy to get away with this we all know he's gonna get caught the only question is how's it gonna be when he does get caught so much fun such a good story we've got a couple new episodes of good ideas for churches up i've got a great interview coming up
