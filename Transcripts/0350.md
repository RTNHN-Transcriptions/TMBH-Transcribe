 I don't like it in movies and books when they skip time. I mean, you're invested in the characters, you like them, but you're there because you care about what's happening to them. And then you just take three or five years off from their lives. It feels like you went to prison and you missed your kid's life or something when Avengers endgame opened up and it was like five years later. That was tough for me because five years of those characters prime just died and I didn't get to see it or experience it or walk through it or understand how they were evolving and changing. I just read a massive book, Ken Follett, Pillars of the Earth and he did the same thing. He would jump ahead for massive amounts of time and it was tough. Look, I don't want to gripe about the Bible or the people who made it. I think they did a really good job. That's why we spend all of this time on it. But I hate that this next little passage we're going to look at implicitly has us skipping a whole bunch of Jesus life. I mean, you only really get a snapshot of three years of his adult effective life anyway. And it just buzzed by several days, weeks, months, whatever this computes to. That's tough. So much stuff must have happened in here. Here's what I'm talking about. It just finished up the really tense part of Matthew 15. And Matthew 15 follows another really tense part where Jesus is grieving the loss of his cousin at the behest of a madman and the cause of death was beheading. That's brutal. He never really gets a chance to grieve. He does the feeding of the 5,000 instead of being sad. He gets a little bit of time on a mountain, but then all of his buddies are getting shipwrecked out in the middle of the water. And so he has to go and bail them out. And then as soon as that's done with a bunch of the fancy Pharisees from Jerusalem come up and yell at him about some stupid stuff and he fights back over that and people feel tension and we even reading it today feel tension. And then he tells a little micro parable saying he's got to move on from these religious leaders to his disciples and they're like, wait, what? And he's frustrated with them and he feels tension there. And so it should be no surprise that finally in Matthew 15 21, the narrative pacing of the book changes and Jesus finally is going to get out of Dodge. Verse 21 says, leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him crying out, Lord, son of David have mercy on me. My daughter's suffering terribly from demon possession, but Jesus didn't answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, send her away for she keeps crying out after us. And then Jesus answered, I was only sent to the lost sheep of Israel, which is wow. It doesn't sound like the Jesus we know that he's going to send this woman away. And I'm not even going to preview the next line that he says to her after she says, Lord, help me because at first blush, it comes off as really mean. We're going to break all of that down next time around. But right now, I just want to talk about this getaway and the fact that this time is elapsing. The last stuff that we looked at in Matthew 15, this difficult exchange is probably happening in Capernaum, maybe just a little bit up the road to the north in Corzine, Bethsaida. This is the neck of the woods where Jesus is working during this chunk. And we know that from a few context clues we've looked at here and by cross referencing things between Mark and Luke as well. And now he's heading up to Tyre. Well, we know where Tyre is on a map. It's way, way up north. This is a very long hike that Jesus is about to engage in. And culturally, he's heading to a completely different place. I don't think there's another reference in the Gospels to Jesus leaving Jewish territory to go into Gentile territory. There are other anecdotes that unfold on what looks like the account of this trip. But in Matthew, at least we only get two little details from this massive walk that Jesus takes way up north and out to the coast in Tyre, then way back inland through, would he be into modern day Syria? It'd be really close if it's not. So he's in Lebanon, he's in Syria, or really close. He's in modern day Jordan. I mean, that's a lot of time. That's a lot of teaching. That's a lot of investment in his disciples is probably a lot of miraculous stuff. And I want it. Why don't we get it? I don't know. I got to go back to that thing that John said at the very end in chapter 20 and that he reiterates in 21 where it clarifies that Jesus did a ton more stuff than what is written down. But this stuff is written down so that you would have what you need in order to believe that Jesus is the Son of God. So Matthew's doing the same thing. He's not giving us everything. And it's interesting that the limited amount of information we have while Jesus is up north on this trip to get away almost reflects a respect for the privacy of what this moment was about on behalf of Matthew. It comes off to me like Matthew is making an editorial decision here to say, ah, that was kind of off the record. This was Jesus very human time not to go and do anything awful or terrible that he shouldn't have done, but to be away from all of this pressure to work through the incredibly difficult things he'd been subjected to. And you don't need to know everything that happened up there. Well, maybe I'm reading into that a little bit, whatever the case by journeying to tire Jesus is entering into the territory that historically we associate with the Phoenicians. I mean, this is the birthplace of the very language that you and I are using right now to communicate. And it was a very different world. Now, tire had an Old Testament history of on again, off again, friendly relationships with the Israelite people. There was a king of tire named Hiram who piled around with Solomon. The Terrians were seafaring. If I remember correctly, they were also the people who came up with that famous regal purple dye that you hear about whenever people tell stories about Tabitha slash dorkus over an act. It's all the commentaries reference that, but I think that was from tire. And of course, Lebanon was famous for the building materials that exported the cedars of Lebanon. But it makes me wonder if this little retreat from Jesus moving from a very low elevation to a little higher elevation to a little cooler climate where they have pine trees is him doing the same kind of stuff that I do sometimes, which is tapping out for a bit to go to the woods. It feels like a team retreat for work or for your church where you go somewhere really pretty and that looks and feels different so that you're not surrounded by the tyranny of the urgent in your local environment. And so that your mind is refreshed by things that look different by beauty by stuff that even smells different weather that feels a little bit differently. But you go on this retreat to think about stuff and to plan in the previous anecdote right before Jesus goes on this trip. The text makes it look to the reader like, Hey, just in case you thought the disciples were ready to go, they're not ready to go. Jesus realizes the disciples are not ready to go. They don't get it. I've spelled this out. Jesus just got done calling Peter dull for not getting it. So what does that mean? What action would that prompt Jesus could just be annoyed and frustrated that the people he's conditioning and preparing to take the baton from him in a little bit aren't ready. He could just be mad like you guys are so dumb. You're so bad, but that isn't what effective leaders do if they realize that their team is deficient. They invest in their team so that their team is ready to go and they become proficient. So on the one hand, yeah, it looks like this is a long overdue. Don't get away for Jesus to shift gears into the next phase of what's going to happen in this whole story of his life, but too, it looks a little bit like a corporate retreat. We're going to go somewhere beautiful and we're going to think hard about things. It looks like Jesus simply cannot find the time with the crush of the crowds and the pressure from the people who don't like them and the threats of murder and the opportunities to teach and reach out to the people who need his compassion. It's like he can't even find the time to build into the disciples properly. And now from a human perspective, at least it looks like, whoa, okay, well, I can hold up a Bible here. I got this many pages left. That's it. That's all of Matthew right there in my right hand. That is not very much and the disciples aren't ready and they got to be ready because Jesus knows he's going to the cross. So it looks like he's going to go make a focused investment in these guys to get them ready. Now, ultimately, are they ready when push comes to shove? Well, Peter about whom Jesus just said, are you still so dull? Goes swinging swords at people, trying to murder him in a few chapters. He says he'll never ever ever abandon Jesus and then immediately renounces his associations with Jesus. So, no, are any of us ever really ready? No, Peter is not ready. And is Peter really ready in a human sense after Jesus is resurrected and spends time with him and then ascends? No, if you look at the quality of his preaching in the early game, no, it doesn't look nearly as developed or to be of the same quality as the stuff he writes later in the epistles. Peter is very much a work in progress from beginning to end. And this little corporate retreat isn't going to solve all of that, but it looks like and as we'll get into the travel itinerary and the geography is a little bit tricky to reconstruct here, it looks like on this quote corporate retreat is where Peter makes the judge. The gigantic leap of going from being so dull to boldly and rightly identifying Jesus as the Christ. But still, a chunk of time passes here where a whole bunch of things happen that I would really like to know and that I would like to be privy to. And I don't get to know that and I understand that I don't get to know that, but I have still lodged a formal complaint and filled out a comment card in future Bibles. I would like these details to please be filled in. Thank you very much. It does not address the question of what Jesus does with this Canaanite woman who comes up or what a Canaanite woman is or why Jesus strikes the tone that he is going to strike. So we'll just tackle all of that next time around. I would anticipate that I'm going to have all of the mailings ready to send out next week for all of the patrons who support the program at any level. You're getting the cool little Matthew Field notes guide book as well as I don't know how many I'm going to send two, three, four of these little cool square, almost business card kind of things. They have a QR code on the back and they're not designed to necessarily get people in touch with me. They're the kind of cards that are designed for, you know, if you felt like it to make it easy for you to recommend the podcast to somebody else if you wanted to do so. You certainly don't have to, but if you did feel like inviting somebody else to listen or a few somebody else is to listen, I'm going to be including a handful of those little cards in each of those. And if you decide to give them away with an invitation, that'd be great. If not, no worries. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
