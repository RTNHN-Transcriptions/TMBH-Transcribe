 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now, we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Mark. The Book of Mark is so much like the Book of Matthew on its surface, and that it is telling the story of Jesus from a very sympathetic perspective. Obviously, Mark thinks Jesus is the Son of God. He thinks Jesus is the Savior of the world, and he wants you to believe that. So, at the most basic level, he's trying to accomplish the same thing that Matthew, before him, was trying to accomplish. He wants to get to the end. He's going to wrap the book up pretty abruptly, just as Matthew did. And the idea is, boom, balls in your court, reader. What are you going to do with that? But where Mark is very different is that he seems to be talking to a completely different audience than Matthew is writing to. And as a result, he's pacing his book very differently because the audience he's writing to doesn't seem to be as interested in all the stuff from the Old Testament. In fact, it looks kind of like Mark is assuming his audience isn't very familiar with much of any of that at all. And so the result is that we see a whole lot of stuff that Jesus did and a very fast-paced telling of the story we just got done with in Matthew. And we get it with a lot fewer words from Jesus. In fact, Mark records fewer than half of the total words of Jesus that we get in the book of Matthew. Well, upon closer examination, we figure out that Mark was a guy who worked with the Apostle Paul. He's part of Generation 2 of Christianity. He traveled with the Apostle Paul in the Book of Acts, which we're going to get to here in a little bit. But he had a falling out with Paul. Paul didn't like his work ethic when he was a young man. And so Mark goes on a different journey and he ends up working with some other people in the early years of the church and eventually starts palling around with Peter as a very close relationship with Peter and apparently wrote a bunch of things down that Peter had said again and again. Well, Peter toward the end of his life ends up in Rome, talking to Roman people, probably giving all kinds of sermons and recollections about the life of Jesus and all these insane, crazy world-changing things that happened during these three big years of Jesus' public life. And we learn from the earliest extra-biblical sources that Mark wrote that stuff down and carefully organized it into a book that would make the whole Jesus thing make sense, not to Jews like what Matthew was doing, but to Romans. So as a result, Mark doesn't give us all the Old Testament stuff. He doesn't give us nearly as many quotes or references to the Old Testament as Matthew does. And when he does give us those, they're a little more veiled. They're like Easter eggs that if part of his Roman audience figured out that Jesus was awesome and then dug deeper into it, they would catch those Easter eggs. So there's no genealogy, there's no birth account. We don't need to know right off the bat that Jesus has descended from David or any of that stuff at all. Instead, the book of Mark opens with the throw down the gauntlet thesis statement right out of the gate that goes like this. First one of chapter one of Mark, the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Well, think about how that's going to sound to a Roman audience. They have tons of gods. So just the fact that God is singular and exclusive here is a bold truth claim in the face of the Roman cosmology, the Roman pantheon of gods, but then also to say that somebody that just like respectfully you Romans and your government had executed. He is the son of God and therefore kind of implicitly what Mark is saying in this opening line is like your government doesn't always get it right and their judgment was incorrect on this one. But here's an opportunity for you, Roman citizen, to take a look at this for yourself and perhaps arrive at a different and better conclusion. And then Mark, knowing the Roman cultural appreciation for sooth saying and prophecy gives his audience a very quick reference to a prophet they've probably never heard of a guy named Isaiah who suggests that there is going to be one who will come and prepare the way. That's John the Baptist and then we're off and running with all of these stories through the first eight chapters that demonstrate Jesus incredible power and it presents him as kind of this man of few words who all of this activity and controversy and difficulty and even spiritual evil is swirling around. But Jesus steps into the fray says what needs to be said and has the power to do what needs to be done and then get on to the next thing. And what is the next thing? Well, if we look at everything, Mark's recording and how he presents it, the next thing is always serving. It's serving God. It's serving men. It's serving women. That would have got people's attention. It's serving Jewish people. Well, you know, obviously you could do that, but it's also serving outsiders, Romans, Gentiles. And through eight chapters, Mark paints this elaborate picture of a servant king. Now that would not have been as familiar to Roman sensibilities. And by the time we get to that pivot point in the middle of the book in chapter eight, it's pretty apparent Jesus is awfully special and the way Mark presents it at this point in the story, it's not particularly difficult for Peter to be like, you are the Messiah. You're the Christ. You're the Son of God. Jesus implicitly affirms that. And then just like in the book of Matthew, he chases it by saying, Yep, and I'm going to die and be raised again on the third day. Now, everything up to this point in the story has happened way up north in the area associated with the Old Testament Kingdom of Israel, the northern kingdom. But now here in the middle of the book, we're making our way down towards Jerusalem where things are no doubt going to get a lot hotter. And as the temperature is getting turned up in this transitional period in the middle of the book, the disciples are wanting to understand exactly how this is all going to work. And Jesus wants them to understand it too, but they're not getting it. And it becomes really clear that they don't understand how Jesus can be this servant king and what the implications are for what it means for them to imitate him in that and follow him. And as we read the rest of the way through the book of Mark, we discover they're not really going to wrap their brains around that until everything has come to pass. And when he gets to Jerusalem, sure enough, the temperature is through the roof. Jesus enemies, that being the religious teachers, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, they come at Jesus with everything they got once he gets to Jerusalem. And sadly, when those religious leaders realize that Jesus does look a lot like that promised servant prophesied from days of your, they become all the more determined to kill him. But not before Jesus has time to institute the last supper and to explain to his disciples in broad strokes what the unfolding of his kingdom is going to look like and how in the time between then and its full visible realization to everybody. If Mark's Roman audience at this point was becoming sympathetic to Jesus, they're going to cringe at what happens here at the end as it's their government who pronounces a sentence of death on Jesus and carries it out. But Mark's Roman audience is going to feel the same thrill of relief and excitement and confusion as to what this means next for them when Jesus as predicted comes back from the grave. Now this book ends weird. It has an addendum at the end that was clearly added by later scribes and that's going to be noted in all of your Bibles. The Christians aren't shy about that reality, but it looks like Mark ended his book and its original form, at least by his recording Jesus resurrection. And then there's some women who followed him who were there and they see it and they run away because the implications of this are too overwhelming and that's the end of the book. And so you as the reader are left to ponder this thing that changes everything as well. The women are considering what will we do with this reality of Jesus defeated death. This changes everything about existence and our understanding of God and what this means for how we live and what we do with the rest of our lives. And indeed, whether you're a Roman reader way back in the day or reading it for the first time this week, either way, the question is meant for you. What will you do with this? We know who Jesus is from the first half of the book. He's the son of God. He's the Messiah and we know what he's done to change the world and to save like a servant. He went to the cross voluntarily and was raised back to life. And like those ladies realized that has certain implications that transcend time. It looks like Mark paced this understanding that the attention span for an outsider to any of this larger story of the Bible would be a little bit smaller. He keeps the action moving, but all of it is still driving toward a clear conclusion. He's making the case that to follow this servant Jesus who died on the cross and was raised is what it is to be in the kingdom of God to be a citizen of that kingdom. And in all of that, Mark presents everybody, but Jesus as wrestling with the enormity of that claim all the way through the book, all the way up to the very end. So if you're reading this and it's a little bit difficult, you're in good company with everybody here. When you visualize the book of Mark picture the cross that the servant voluntarily went to and died upon. When you think about the theme, obviously reflect on the idea of Christ, the servant. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to at least catch Mark 10 35 through 45 where Jesus really nails the theme of him as that servant. And then I'm going to ask you to go back and read some stuff in Isaiah. There are four songs back there that predict this servant thing. And if the book of Mark wasn't in the Bible, I'm not sure those predictions about Jesus would be explicitly paid off when you go back and read them and I'll mout your brain because they're beautiful. And they do point so clearly to Jesus, especially as presented in Mark, that's Isaiah 42, one through nine, Isaiah, forty nine, one through thirteen, Isaiah, fifty four through eleven and Isaiah 52, thirteen through the next chapter, fifty three and verse twelve. I'll try to remember to put all of that down there in the show notes as well. So it's easy to look up next time around. We're going to turn the page and start the story over again from a fresh perspective with the gospel of Luke. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
