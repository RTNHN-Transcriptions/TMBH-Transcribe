 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and thank you for hanging out with me. I know you got a Jillian things to do and yet here we are working our way through the book of Matthew a little bit every weekday morning. It really does mean a lot to you and make the time to process this through with me. I have a hot take that is going to offend some of you and I'm sorry. Oh, I'm going to say that. Not actually sorry that it might offend you. I think the Academy Award winning film Gladiator starring Russell Crowe was good, but not great. However, one of the things that I really liked about that movie was the theme of the fickleness of the crowds is. Emblamized by Joaquin Phoenix's right thumb that thumb sticks up and everybody cheers because the person isn't going to be executed on the sand of the arena that thumb sticks down and everybody cheers because somebody's going to get executed right in front of their eyes and you're like, who are you people? They just cheer for anything. Whatever is trendy or whatever like the three or four people around you were doing, you just get all excited about that. Even somebody getting murdered and cold blood. What does it matter with you? There's even that speech from how's the guy's name? Praxis. I don't know if that says the guy's name. I think I'm making up something from Transformers, but there's a guy who really in his career, he gives Maximus that coaching about, if you get the crowd, you got it. If you don't, you're in big trouble. That's really what the exercise and being a gladiator is all about. You don't even have to look to gladiator to think about this theme of the crowds. You can remember your childhood with your parents or whoever raised you. You can remember the speeches you got about like, well, if everybody jumped off a bridge, did you jump off a bridge too? You can remember the after school specials and the the more you know 15 second commercial spots with celebrities where they act like they super care about you and they talk about the dangers of peer pressure and listening to what everybody else does. We all like to imagine that we are hyper independent and we're above it and we're these cold observers who look in on these squishy crowds and just put our hands on our hips and shake our heads and how gullible everybody else is to care about that stuff. Maybe at some point when you were younger, you even thumped your chest. If you're a guy, be careful. If you're a lady and exclaimed something like, I don't care what anybody thinks about me. I do what I want. I don't care what anybody thinks. I don't all care about what people think and we're all affected by the crowds. We care very, very much about what all of the opinions are before we go and blurt out our opinions. We've been smacked down a few too many times for wrong think and it seems like wrong think is becoming something that we are more and more smacked down for by the crowds every day as time passes right now. So you and I, well, I can't say for sure you, but I can say for sure I have this unusual relationship with the crowds that has nipped my heels for my entire life. Do I care what they think? Yeah, I care what they think. Do I also know it's good not to care what they think? Yeah. Also, the crowds, the squishy middle, not the people who are really devoted to this notion on the one end of things or that notion on the other end of things in a democratic republic, a constitutional republic like what we live in. The crowds, the squishy middle, that's who decides everything. It's those 15 or 20% of undecided voters that all that ad money gets thrown at to get them worked up or whatever to vote for this thing this time or that thing. The other time is effectively the people who care the least and are least principally committed to anything are the ones who decide the most policy and the most trajectory of society. So maybe if it seems like we wander aimlessly at times right now, it could be because we've built our system to follow the lead of those who are perhaps wandering a bit aimlessly. And they're not bad people. They just rather not be asked. They're like, I don't want to vote. I don't know what to do. I'm part of the squishy middle crowds. I'm not committed right now. Just don't make me decide. No, you have to decide. Okay, fine. All the side. And they pick things and everybody gets mad about what they picked. And this strange human phenomenon of the dance we do with the crowds with group thought, with the spirit of the age is not new. People have been doing this forever. People have been looking to their left and their right to make sure they're thinking or saying the right things since forever. And we see it profoundly on display in the New Testament and in the setting of Jesus age. These people on the pages of scripture are so much like you and me dealing with the same pressures as you and me psychologically. And if this feels like a long warm up, that's because it is. This isn't an introduction to one passage. Today, we're turning the page and we're introducing a whole new block of thought in the book of Matthew. That's why we're moving slow and breaking down one big idea here because I think this big idea is what frames the whole thing. You and I, my friends, as we've been working through Matthew have spent a ton of time on the smallest group of people who we see interacting with Jesus. That would be the people who were in the people looked at it and are like, Yep, that kingdom is real. Yep, you are the king. Well, the genealogy checks out the prophecy checks out the miracles check out the teaching checks out. This is the predicted son of man. This is the son of David. This is the Messiah and we are in teach us you alone have the words of life to whom else would we turn them drawn from somewhere else there? But you get what I'm saying. We've spent quite a bit of time focusing on the next biggest group following Jesus around and interacting with him. And those are the people who rejected vehemently reject who Jesus is, reject his claims. And especially chapter 12, it's been all about that crowd. Jesus is rejecting them back and condemning their mindset, their words, their attitude and condemning their rejection itself. But there's this big giant group that is the group as we discussed the shapes so much of history who we've talked about very little. It's the group that I bet you and me would be in. Now whether you are like me and you'd say, I think there's a God and I think there's a God behind the Bible and Jesus thing is pretty compelling. I guess you would call me in whether you're like me or whether you're in a different place where you'd say, this is not quite enough for me to say I'm in. I'm intrigued by this aspect of history and the shadow it casts over the last couple thousand years, but I wouldn't call myself in. This is still a place where you and I, my friend, are very, very similar. We would be in the squishy middle if we were here. And so now in chapter 13 of Matthew, the attention is going to turn to these crowds. The people who are in have made their decision. The people who are out have made their decision. And what we're going to see moving forward in this next chunk is Jesus characterizing the kingdom in such a way that it's going to parse out that squishy middle. It's going to move people from, I don't know quite what to make of things to, I just can't do this or to whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I see it now. Okay. I thought there might be something to it because people were signing up, but I see it. You explained that thing and now I get how the kingdom is and okay, all right, all right, I'm in and we're going to linger on the two verses. I'm about to read you at the beginning of Matthew 13 for a little while here, but let me just frame it up. Verse one, that same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it while all the people stood on the shore. And that goes on to say, and he told them a bunch of things in parables. We've hinted at why parables instead of straightforward rhetoric, like what we saw in the last two chapters already, we'll break that down more in the coming episodes. For now, our point of emphasis is this, the text and Jesus are turning their attention to the squishy middle and we're going to see a wedge get driven right through the middle of the squishy middle in such a way that Jesus is going to increase the number of people who are in, but he's also going to increase the number of people who are enemies. So in line to that, Matthew 13 is pretty important for the process you and I are in together here. This is one of the key parts of Matthew that is designed by the author and by Jesus who said this stuff in the first place to nudge not just the original crowd toward starting to sort this thing out, but to nudge all future readers toward starting to sort this thing out. Does the kingdom sound good or doesn't it? Does it sound real and true or doesn't it? Does the kingdom look better or worse than the world kingdom that we're all born into do and citizens of by nature of our existence on this planet and by nature, the fact that we draw breath as humans? Now to be clear, no pressure from me. This is not my timeline. The nature of our relationship is such that you know, you land anywhere you want to land on this stuff. We're doing more the enjoyable processing and work through the data to have a baseline of understanding of what the text is saying thing than we are doing the persuasive. I think you ought to do everything this way and think this way and believe this stuff. You're going to land where you're going to land and that is cool. High five. So if you feel like the text as we work through Matthew 13 is pushing you, I think that's the design of the text and not necessarily the design of me. While there is this undertone toward the crowds throughout the teachings of Jesus that suggest that we're processing this right now, but eventually there's going to be a next thing that happens. Eventually this is going to get sorted out while that is there. There's also clear language from Jesus saying like count the cost, add the thing up, figure it out. We're only in chapter 13 and you're only wherever you are in life. Your buffer bar is still filling. So we got time to think about this thing, to think about it carefully. And if we decide to continue to be in on the whole Christian thing or to become in on the whole Christian thing, we want to do that with eyes wide open and knowing what we're doing, not be in or buy in because some person you probably never met on the internet said that things into a microphone and made you feel weird pressure. It ain't about me. Next time around, we're going to talk more about the setting of this situation. And if we have time, we'll start getting into even what parables are and why we're ready for a whole chapter of them coming up next. A bunch of you support the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast, which is ridiculous. Also it's why this happens. So thank you a ton. Also a bunch of you don't support the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast, which is cool too. Thank you for being here. You don't need to support the program to listen to it with a clean conscience. I'm just delighted we get to do this together. Thanks everybody for being here. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
