 We want to watch the new Spider-Man movie the other day with the kiddos and that raised questions about older Spider-Man movies with the kiddos and then I wanted to go see the Sam Raimi films with Toby Maguire and then the amazing Spider-Man stuff with Andrew Garfield. We've been watching through those and it is so jarring after 15 years or whatever we're at of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to go back and watch the Sam Raimi, Toby Maguire Spider-Man films because they're campy and silly and the humor hits different and the themes, the moral ethical themes are so pronounced at times, perhaps even a little bit over pronounced and the main character is so flawed. Man, I just never noticed when I was young and I watched those movies how many problems Spider-Man had that really weren't external to him. They were Peter Parker problems. What could I do there? It's called alliteration. And then you get toward the end of all of those shows and there's always a moment where CGI Spider-Man, he swings in front of an American flag and he perches there for a minute and cranes his neck and then swings into action. And look, now we're here. I like America. I like my country, particularly the land and the people and many of the values at many times as I look at American history, as is the case with my opinion of most governments throughout history. Just like Jesus is teaching as he contrasts Kingdom values of world Kingdom values. Look, I'm just not, I'm just not always super high on how governments behave and our government is no exception. There've been moments of nobility, but I think you also got to be honest about the moments of not so nobility that have existed. That's the end of my comment on that. All of that disclaimer aside, as I'm watching this thing, I see Spider-Man predictably swinging in front of the flag and it flaps there in the wind and flexes muscles before he goes off to save the day. I felt a little something. And I think the little something that I felt was this tinge of man, that image means something, that flag right there. It's supposed to mean something. There's ideas you're supposed to rally around there. And by that, I don't mean like Republican stuff or Democrat stuff. I mean, like civil liberties and the value of humans and the Western idea of people having value and freedom and things like that. And I felt that in that moment, despite all of the complex feelings I feel towards mine and other governments over the years. And every now and then, I think you see something that is a symbol of a bigger idea and a history and a story that has really complicated characters in it and messy stuff and beautiful stuff, principles that are emblemized there, that there's some kind of future to that sort of thing. And I think that impulse toward hope and pride, but also conflictedness and optimism, that sense that this is a symbol of something that I feel when I encounter the American flag from time to time or the Statue of Liberty or the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota is the same kind of thing that people in the original audience for the book of Matthew felt when they saw or talked about or thought about the temple. The temple kind of was the flag. It was the rallying point that was emblematic of the unique presence of God, not a regional local God, but the God, the initiator of all of reality, the essence of essence, the I am being in and of itself, unlimited in all capacities that God had chosen to make a dwelling among us in that temple. And so to the Jewish people, they would look at that and say, we are unique people amongst all the people because God has chosen us and God has been persistent with us and forgiving with us for all of the ups and downs that are all fully on display and easily remembered just even as we buzz through the names in the genealogy at the beginning of Matthew. Matthew wants to remind us of all of the ups and downs of the story by listing all of those names out. People would have felt that and the same way that you feel a stir of something in whatever communities you're a part of when you see that image or that thing that is the emblem of your shared hope and your shared identity, your shared common understanding of histories, past and trajectory moving forward. If you can understand that, I think you can understand what the people felt here. So the temple comes up all over the place in the book of Matthew. And for you and I, it's going to be most easy to think of that as an old building that was very, very large and that some people were proud of. And we talked about the largeness of the building and just how there would be a source of national and religious pride that would come along with that simply because of the engineering, creativity and achievement that is represented in this stunning building where the largest stone is 40 school buses worth a weight. People there were entirely justified in feeling a sense of civic and religious pride over this thing and kind of elbowing each other and being like, this temple that is just now finishing its renovations and its expansions. This is more impressive than anything that people widely regard as the most impressive buildings in all of history. This is as good as it gets and all of those other things are dedicated to false deities and men who just lived and died or even dedicated to the idea of human knowledge, a tower of Babel like the lighthouse of Alexandria, but not so with the temple. This is where the one true God dwells and we have built him a building that begins to approach the proper splendor for just what such a God is and what such a God deserves. So the physical achievement itself once again is a big point of pride, but also you hear what I'm weaving into that as we go along. The narrative is a source of pride. It's not like somebody just whipped up plans and built a building real quick. This spot has been the elevated place that has been where God has dwelt with his chosen people for a thousand years at this point, set aside a few years of hiccup here and there. The original temple that was built by Solomon was really cool and really impressive and amazing things happened at that dedication. And so people felt like no, it's not just something we speculate about that God showed up at the dedication of the temple and that he lives there. No, no, no, like we are sure that God lives in this temple and here's why because back in first Kings chapter eight and yes, I had to look that up. We get this account that lends itself tremendously to the shared story that everybody had about what the temple really is and what goes on there. So God has made David a promise that not David, but his son can go ahead and build the temple. David instead is going to get this eternal throne on which a great king is going to rain forever. And it does fall to Solomon, David's son to get after making this temple. Then we get to chapter eight. Now everybody's gathered around and we're going to dedicate this thing. This is what happened. In King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem, the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families to bring up the ark of the Lord's covenant from Zion, the city of David. All the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival and the month of man, these words are hard, ethhenim, the seventh month. When all the elders had arrived, the priests took up the ark and they brought up the ark of the Lord and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings and at the priests and the Levites carried them up. King Solomon, the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him, were before the ark sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted. The priests then brought the ark of the Lord's covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the most holy place and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles. These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary but not from the outside of the holy place and they are still there today. There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in at horrib where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. See the ark of the covenant, you see what they're doing there. But they get this part, this is where it all happens. When the priests withdrew from the holy place, the cloud filled the temple of the Lord and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord filled the temple. Then Solomon said, the Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud. I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever. While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them, then he said, praise me to the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his own hand is fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said, and then he goes on to say a bunch of things, and it's really awesome. I'd encourage you to go and read 1 Kings 8 because it is a pretty sophisticated litany of stuff that Solomon has to say there. The point is, this is a day like none other in the history of ever, this dedication. At that moment, the priests and everybody putting everything in the temple, they're moving stuff in there and they're performing these services because God doesn't live in the temple yet. But this most holy place, the holy of holies is supposed to be so holy and set apart from God that you can't go in there or some of that Old Testament stuff that happens when you get too close to the first cause of all things that just melts you. People just die when they get too close to the glory of God. And so the priests, it says, they can't even go in there after the cloud of the presence of the Lord goes into this place. And so this exists in the memory of the people. It's written down and recorded. God actually showed up. You think about what happened with Elijah and the prophets of Baal and all of those prophets and all that money and all that sacrificing and Baal never really showed up. God showed up. And here again, in contrast with all of the false deities that the Old Testament describes from other people groups, their God stands out as actually being there. I am is being. He is unlimited and he makes his dwelling here in this place. That right there is going to cast such a long shadow in terms of how the Israelite people, how the Jewish people think of their relationship with God and how they think of that relationship geographically. This space is beyond sacred. It means so much to them because the Ark of the Covenant that eventually goes away, it's there that the deal, what was written down, it's held right there. That's where the deal happened. That's where God exists. If you go and mess with it, you run into the presence of God and that reminds us that this is where God exists. Well, the story doesn't end there though because some more stuff happens over the course of the Old Testament, Indian suing, 900, whatever it is, 50 years after that. During that time, we see this temple get taken apart and the beginnings of it rebuilt and it gets dedicated again. Next time around, we're going to talk about what happened at that dedication, how it contrasts to this first dedication in 1 Kings 8. Once again, what we're going for here by looking at this whole backstory about the temple and what it means is that we're trying to wrap our brains around what this emblamized to the people in the first century, the original audience. What was the temple to them? Not just a building. What was the story that it encapsulated? What was the hope that came with it? What were the anxieties that came with it? I want us to get to a place where in the same way, you can sort of intuit what the different grand symbols of different communities and countries around the world mean to people in those communities right now. So we want to really understand what this meant to them so that we can better comprehend what Jesus is doing and why he's doing it that way and what Matthew wrote down. Some of you support this podcast at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast and I noticed a handful of you come in here right at the beginning of the year. What an encouraging helpful thing that is. Golly, thank you for what an enormous encouragement that is at the same time. Whenever I say that, I want to make it really clear. You don't have to do that. You don't have to feel bad about not doing that. This is a free podcast. It's only going to make sense for a very small percentage of people to go and voluntarily kick in on something that is meant to be freely consumed. So no pressure ever come and go as you need to. But thank you so much to everybody who at any point for any amount of time has been able to help make this thing go. I think all of you are awesome either way. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye.
