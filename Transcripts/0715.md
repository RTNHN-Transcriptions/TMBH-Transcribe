 Hey, everybody, I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast and you're going to feel it. You're going to feel a knee jerk reaction a minute to be like, well, I don't know if we can talk about that, but we can because we can talk about anything because it's talking. It's thinking about ideas. It's good for us, especially when we live in an age where it's like, Hey, you probably shouldn't talk about that. There's a political thing going on in my country right now. You can be on whatever side of it you want to be on and we can still get along. We're going to be just fine. I'm not an adherent to any political party. So you know, I don't necessarily have a dog in this fight though. I do have opinions about the situation. Recently, the president is Joe Biden as I'm recording. This is the president of the United States. He has been clearly concerned that some of his political opponents might imagine that they pose some kind of real threat to the American government. He's made a couple of speeches about it. One of those, I think, was very ill advised in terms of the visual presentation that happened earlier this week. And in these speeches and in these remarks, he's repeatedly said things like, Hey, y'all should just knock it off with this kind of, you know, push back on the government stuff because you'd need a 15s to fight the government anyway. Like you have no chance. You don't pose any actual real threat to our government. Maybe you agree with his assessment. Maybe you don't. What I do know is that most people of all political stripes who I've spoken to have found the tone to be a bit odd and off-putting. Some of them have found it to be downright troubling. And I know very few people who've liked it. That said, it sounds like the guy is making an honest assessment as best as he can see it of what the actual threat level that is posed by his political opponents, the most radical of them perhaps. He's made an honest assessment. He's like, you know what? My assessment is not much of an actual threat. Likewise, I think pilot is running the same kind of calculation that any emperor, any president, any leader on whose head heavy rests the crown has to make when they look at their potential opposition. Is this a real threat who deserves to be taken seriously, deserves to have resources thrown at them, deserves even the swinging of the sword or violence to stop it? Or is this a threat that is a total non threat and it would actually be more politically expedient for me to just pretend like they don't exist and move forward? Oh, in the same way that all of us from all of our various party affiliations are watching President Biden run that mental calculation right now. So we also get to in Matthew 27, watch Pontius Pilate, another powerful ruler run a similar calculation with Jesus. And it would seem based on what we're reading here that he's not very impressed. Matthew 27, 11, see, we did fine. Look at that. We're fine. Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him, are you king of the Jews? Yes. It's as you say, Jesus replied more on that remark in a minute when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. Then pilot asked him, don't you hear the testimony they're bringing against you? But Jesus made no reply, not even a single charge to the great amazement of the governor. We get a pretty good sense from this passage, what the dynamic is and what's going on in pilots had, he hasn't care about him the size stuff or whatever. He just cares about the king thing because that puts him on the hot seat with the emperor Tiberius and his relationship with Tiberius as we've discussed with shaky at this time. So he's like, am I dealing with an actual revolutionary threat here or no, it would seem by pilots actions that he's like, no, I'm definitely not dealing with a revolutionary threat. John gives us a very expanded version of this entire conversation. Matthew is obviously trying to put the emphasis on the reality that Jesus didn't fire back and forth with the chief priests and keeping with the prophecy we talked about back in Matthew 26. And clearly for the sake of efficiency and to avoid confusion, he kind of hustles through the trial with pilot a little bit and doubles down on the Jesus didn't answer the chief priests. He didn't play ball. He didn't get in the mud with them by telling us that the chief priests were right there and they were accusing him with pilot present. But like I said, John in chapters 18 and 19 really pinch zooms on this situation. And we get a lot of exchange. It looks like it's just happening between pilot and Jesus himself. And it looks like pilot is going back and forth to the Jewish leadership. And they come in and like parlaying with Jesus in a way that seems pretty collegial. And when all the demands are made and it looks like the fate is sealed, pilot still comes back again in John 19. What am I at? 10. And he's like, Hey, do you refuse to speak to me? I said, don't you realize I have the power either to free you or crucify you? And then Jesus answers him, you'd have no power over me if it weren't given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin. The details we get in John continue to give the impression of a pilot who's dragging his heels and clearly thinking to himself, the risk of trouble. If I kill this guy is greater because of how unjust and stupid this execution will be, and the risk of letting him go, there's just no chance that this guy is going to attack the government. He doesn't have that kind of following. He isn't the prototypical revolutionary with weapons and followers and financial backers. The way he approached Jerusalem, he was like, donkey, come on. He's not a war horse. There's just nothing about him that screams threat to Rome in any way whatsoever. And so I think pilot is making the presidential assessment and saying he simply does not have what he needs to depose Roman rule here to threaten the temple, to threaten my legions, to threaten my authority. And if that's the charge that's brought against him to kill him, I'm not sure that's enough. He doesn't sound like a revolutionary, doesn't look like a revolutionary, doesn't have the resources of a revolutionary pilot doesn't seem to think Jesus is a threat. But was he? Hmm. Well, Edward Gibbon, the famous historian who wrote the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, he certainly thought that the teachings of Christ and the remnants of his kingdom after his death are what softened up Rome and wrecked the whole thing. So in retrospect, there would be some who would say Jesus claimed a kingship was misassessed by Pontius Pilate. And he was indeed a tremendous threat. The greatest threat Rome would still be governing. If it weren't for the way Christianity and Jesus supposed values of the kingdom corrupted it and softened the most powerful empire ever. But what is Jesus referencing when he says, yes, it is, as you say, yes, I am the king of the Jews. Well, okay, this Bible here. Okay. Okay. Samuel, Daniel Kings. The second Samuel seven, there's an exchange here between Nathan the prophet and David. I've referenced this a good, Jillian times through the course of our conversations here about Matthew, but David's like, I'm going to, I'm going to build a house for you. God. Like let's, let's let God know that. And Nathan's like, no, let's tell David this instead. We're going to get to the temple and the dwelling place and all of that. But what I'm going to do instead, David is I'm going to make you a promise. And the promise all, I mean, it's, it's God is very articulate. He does a lovely job through Nathan. The promise to David picks up part way through here in about verse 11. And it's interesting the way it's framed because it's the promise of what will happen with his offspring Solomon. But then there's also implicit the promise of this eternal kingdom that will come after it. So there's some language in here that's directed about how God will deal with Solomon. There's some language in here that gets picked up big time by Isaiah, the prophet and others about this eternal throne that points to Jesus. So here's the language. Remember, we're talking about Solomon and this lasting promise. The Lord declares to you that the Lord himself will establish a house for you, David. When your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you who will come from your own body. And I will establish his kingdoms. And now we're talking about Solomon. He's the one who will build a house for my name. Now we're talking about Solomon's temple. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. Whoever sits on that throne is going to be the Messiah. That's Jesus back to Solomon. I will be his father and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men with floggings inflicted by men. But my love will never be taken away from him. Still talking about Solomon as I took it away from Saul who came before David, whom I removed before you. Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me. Your throne will be established forever. That is where this Messiah is the king of the Jews thing starts. And then of course, the northern and southern kingdoms get hauled off into captivity by the Assyrians and Babylonians respectively in the seven thirties and five eighties respectively. It looks like there's going to be nothing left, but then Cyrus the Great comes along in the five thirties slash five twenties and sends the Israelites back to rebuild their temple and eventually to govern themselves. And then it looks like they're going to pee a people again. And that's where the prophets start chiming in and they're like the throne, the line. It's not cut off. There's still one who's going to come and sit on that. And that is the Messiah. That's where all this concept comes from. So when Pilate asks Jesus because he wants to know if he's a threat, are you the king of the Jews? And Jesus says, yes, it is as you say, they're talking about different thrones. Obviously Jesus is not talking about the Roman governorship or even Herod's puppet throne. He's talking about the eternal throne of David, a throne that he does not need to use conventional weapons of mankind to conquer or the values of the world kingdom to conquer. It's a kingdom established by a different power and in a different way. Also it is a massively important mic drop moment because Jesus is affirming on the record. No doubt with the court stenographer present that indeed he is the king of the Jews. He's confirming what he confirmed to Peter earlier on and what has been self evident throughout that he is indeed the Messiah, the king of the Jews. And so that's a really, really big and important line. Look, it makes sense that the pilot would want to size Jesus up be like, how powerful are you? How much of a threat do you pose? He looks at him. He's like, yeah, not much. We don't really need to be doing much here policy wise. It's under pressure and duress that he issues the verdict that we're going to see him issue. He's in a confused weird state and he's not sizing up the situation to consider the even possibility that there's an actual God who is the God of the Jews and that that actual God would actually take on flesh and come into the world and do what Jesus is about to do. He's just not, he doesn't have a category for it. It's not even on his radar. So he and Jesus are talking about two very different things and it's a pretty interesting dynamic. Hey, I haven't said it for a while. So I'm going to say it now. All you support the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. You are awesome. I love doing this.
