 There's this whole cottage industry that's evolving on the internet where people, particularly on YouTube, just follow every new Disney plus or Amazon or HBO or whatever series it is. And then they go and make Easter egg videos about it. And they're like, what happened here? And look at the connection here. And if you look at the comic book it was based on here, you can see that this author wrote the comic book originally in 1961 said this. And it's a nod to this number that's in the thing. And I think it's all really interesting and I enjoy some of that because I like narrative, but also it's all a knock off because seriously, they, they, they, that whole idea of the deep dive into the back catalog to understand all the connections and all Easter eggs and nuggets saw from the Bible. And we get to do it like normal Tuesday for us. We do that all the time. So what we're going to do today is matter of fact, because there's stuff in here where Matthew's like, Hey, it's just like the thing from the Bible. You remember it? If you don't go look it up, you might act just to be cool. Like, yeah, I remember it. Totally remembered, but you didn't. And I didn't either. So I had to look it up and I'm going to share it with you. This is what we got. Matthew 27 is this whole tragic Judas business and yeah, look, I know the guy screwed up and I know he did really bad stuff and we're against Judas because he's against Jesus and I like I get it. Also, come on, let's be a little bit human here. This guy had the deck stacked against him in horrible ways. The entire force of the whole religious corrupt establishment was working him over. And then on top of that, get Satan master of darkness, Prince of evil who occupied his soul for a minute there. I said, it's a tough draw for Judas. And then he goes and feels bad about it and the people who worked him over like, like we care, idiot. You thought like you thought we had something here, like some kind of connection. Like, what did you look into my priestly eyes and see some sort of flicker there? And you thought like, maybe we were best friends now or something. Get out of here. You're weirdo. And then Judas is like, ah, this golf only takes the money that they gave him. The 30 pieces, silver, he throws it into the temple, dang it. And then he just, he goes and he hangs himself somewhere. And then after that, the chief priests pick up the coins and they are not at all concerned about the reality that they just basically worked somebody over and used them up and disposed of them. They're getting somebody killed right now. They're like, no, we got to make sure that we dot eyes and cross T's here and make sure that everything's in order. Cause we're really matters is proper protocol for how to spend money and where it came from. So the chief priests picked up the coins and said it's against the law and put this into the treasury since it's blood money. So they decided to use the money to buy a potter's field is a burial place for foreigners. This is why it has been called the field of blood to this day. Then what was spoken by Jeremiah, the prophet was fulfilled. Colin space space, open quote. They took the 30 silver coins of the price set on him by the people of Israel and they used them to buy the potters field as the Lord commanded me. Unquote as we discussed yesterday, Luke didn't seem to have a ton of interest in connecting all of the dots on this potter's field thing. I'm not sure I totally got around to highlighting that particular element of why we read Matthew and Luke's account in acts of Judas death and the naming of the potters feel differently. But clearly, as we're seeing today reading this part of the reason for it is that Matthew is making yet another connection back to the old test zone about the stuff that was written down there and how things are playing out right now. Jesus is the fulfillment, not just of all the smoking gun prophecies, but also of the whole narrative in general. Well, this one isn't as neat and tidy as some of the other connections to the Old Testament. You'll recall we had one way back early on about Nazarene stuff where it's not super clear what prophecy Matthew is saying was fulfilled. And this one looks like an amalgam of maybe three different sets of fulfillment starting with Jeremiah 18 one through four. So I turn. I'm just a second. I'm okay. That's not going well. Just I almost got just don't don't hang up. Got it. Jeremiah 18 one through four. This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord. Go down to the potter's house and there I will give you my message. So I went down to the potter's house and I saw him working at the wheel, but the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands. So the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as it seemed best to him. Just like seriously put a pin in that because it's super, super matters and we're going to turn what we're going to turn zero pages because it's right over here. Jeremiah 19 one through 13. Am I going to read all of this? Maybe we'll see. This is what the Lord says going by a clay jar from a potter. Take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests and go out to the valley of Ben Hinnam near the entrance of the pot. Third gate there proclaim the words I tell you and say here the word of the Lord, O kings of Judah and the people of Jerusalem. This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says. Listen, I'm going to bring a disaster on this place and that really isn't keeping with the theme of Jeremiah throughout that there's this judgment and this devastation and the devastation is described in pretty gruesome ways, much like Judas's death. I don't think it's crazy to connect the language here in Jeremiah 19 to Jesus words of warning in Matthew. It's got to be what the end of 23 about see your house is left desolate. Yeah, Matthew 2438. Look, your house is left to you desolate. So there's some critique here of the Jewish leadership. There's some fulfillment motif with Judas. It's just not neat and tidy. It's like the story is rhyming more than the smoking gun prophecy thing, but there's more in Jeremiah than I want to read. Just we're going to go to Jeremiah 32 six through nine, which touches on this again. It's important to me that you know, as I am turning pages, that I do not know these things off the top of my stomach that I know of the top of my head because I've read it a lot. But like this kind of stuff, I got to look this up. I wrote it down in front of me before we turn the thing on. So I don't think like, Oh man, I didn't know those three references to Jeremiah off the top of my head and I've gone to church for like 10 years. I'll never be good at this. You're great at this. You can totally do this on your own. I have the benefit of being able to prepare in advance because I know what we're going to talk about next. And there's a ton of this stuff that you would just never remember if you didn't go and look it up and do a little bit of digging. So we're learning together. Jeremiah 32 six Jeremiah said, the word of the Lord came to me. Hannah, male son of Shalom, your uncle is going to come to you and say, by my field at anaphoth, because as nearest relative, it is your right and duty to buy it. And just as the Lord had said, my cousin, Hanamal came to me in the courtyard of the garden and said, by my field at anaphoth in the territory of Benjamin, since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself. I knew that this was the word of the Lord. So I bought the field at anaphoth from my cousin in Hanamal and weighed out for him 17 shekels of silver. So in all of this Jeremiah stuff about potters and clay and fields and all of that, it seems like a whole lot of those themes Matthew is saying are somehow resolved or echoed in what we're getting here with Judas. Now Matthew has also spent a bunch of time talking about Zechariah as we have discussed and over in Zechariah 11, which I am going to find right now. Ah, got it. In verses 12 and 13, we get something that is a little more smoking gun. I told them, if you think it best, give me my pay, but if not, keep it. So they paid me 30 pieces of silver and the Lord said to me, throw it to the potter, the handsome price at which they priced me. So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord to the potter. Now you might be wondering, why didn't Matthew also acknowledge the Zechariah stuff? Because I'm in the Jeremiah. I see it. It's a lot of the same themes. It feels like there's a narrative conclusion or follow through in this story for the Jeremiah stuff, but the more smoking gun overt follow through seems to be in Zechariah. So why would Matthew just reference Zechariah and give him credit there as well? And the answer to that question is, I don't know. Because it seems like he would want to also reference Zechariah there, but he didn't. Right now, my working guess would be that the Zechariah thing is very, very obvious, but Matthew's trying to draw the connections between all sorts of places in the Old Testament. And this afforded him the opportunity to point out, like, no, the story really legitimately does point from Jeremiah to this as well. And you guys were already in Zechariah. So you're going to find that connection for yourselves. It could be. There's also all of that language in Jeremiah about like the potters, like, I'm in charge of the clay. I do with it what I want. And that theme plays out further on in the New Testament in terms of this idea that God can make vessels for whatever he wants to use them for, because he's God and he's right in his ways and his judgment and justice and that language of the potter and the clay and the pot not getting to turn back around to the potter and be like, why'd you make me this way? I want to be made this other way because the potter is the one in charge. Maybe some of that language is there as well. It feels like there's about 20 different levels of this connects the dots in terms of theology, in terms of narrative rhyming. And of course, there's the implicit reference there to something we talked about when we were talking about Judas before in Exodus 21 and the whole thing about a slave price. What was that? Exodus 21 32, if the bull gores a male or female slave, the owner must pay 30 shekels of silver to the master of the slave and the bull must be stoned. So there's even kind of this hint of like, oh, he became a slave to them. I mean, that's a number that people would have remembered legally at the most basic level. It looks like Matthew is saying, Hey, look at this pattern of people rejecting God and resisting him and the ruin that comes as a result of that that we see thematically across all of Zechariah and all of Jeremiah. And here's a point that we can latch on to story wise that demonstrates that that same rejection of God and resistance to God and the problems and fate that comes with it. That's what's happening here in the Judas story. It's just an extension of the same kind of stuff we saw happening in the Old Testament story. It looks to me like that is the connection. Tomorrow we are on to Jesus trial before Pontius Pilate, but she'd be a hoot. Thanks for hanging out with me and Matt, this is 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
