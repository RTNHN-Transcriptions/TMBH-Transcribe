 What's up, my friends? I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and we are inching our way through the Book of Matthew one little bit at a time. We do that every weekday morning in 10-ish minute chunks. And if you've been hanging around for a while, you've figured out that every now and then the pace of things slows just a bit, because we get into a text that maybe is more complicated. You've got to think about it more. Maybe it's more controversial, and it needs a little more attention than the other text to give a fair treatment to what other people think about it besides me or other reads that people have had in history. Maybe sometimes we might linger on a text because the implications are a little bit bigger, or it's because it's fun. Right now, though, we've been lingering on Matthew 11, 27, and goes like this. This is Jesus talking, by the way. All things have been committed to me by my father. No one knows the son except the father, and no one knows the father except the son and those to whom the son chooses to reveal him. And yesterday, as you and I were working on this, we really focused on the knowing part of the equation. What would it be to know another entity so perfectly and so completely? To know another entity without any limits whatsoever. I mean, at some point, you just kind of become one entity. And we talked about how the Bible characterizes the deity of Christianity as an unlimited infinite being, unlimited, unbounded by anything in any way. And since there is no other entity that would also be infinite and unlimited for that God character to have a relationship with, it's kind of a big deal then that that is accounted for in the Christian, the biblical conception of God because perfect relationship could not happen external to a perfect divine infinite character. Rather the perfect, infinite, unlimited, flawless knowing and relationship thing would have to somehow be accounted for within that deity himself. And that's part of the beauty of the Christian conception is it does account for perfect relationship as being something that this deity who is unlimited experiences. If that's a little bit overwhelming and you didn't listen to yesterday's episode, you might enjoy going and catching that. But I mentioned yesterday that if this is hard for you, the concept that you have one being that is made of multiple beings or that's a heretical the way I just said that I think. But one being with three expressions. Oh, wait, no, that's a little bit heretical the way I just said that I think or one being that exists in three different forms. Oh, wait, no, that's actually a little bit heretical the way I just said that I think. Here's the deal. If you have trouble with that, the point I'm trying to illustrate is join the club. It's a difficult concept. Christians have had a challenging time finding a unified way to articulate this necessary element of the God that Christians believe exists and the God that Christians believe the biblical text and reason points to. My friends, again, if this is difficult for you, you're in great company because the greatest minds in the history of Christianity or at least the first several centuries of Christianity did practically nothing other than wrestle with this question. And there were outsiders who looked at this difficult question about the nature of Jesus and the nature of God and how it all fits together. And they came up with different plans and Christians. Then we come back and be like, no, no, no, no, no, we left a gap in our language. We need to say this more precisely. So it's reflective of what reason and the Bible dictates. And this is what produces in large part the age of the creeds. And so these creeds or these succinct theological statements of Christian basic theology, especially as it pertains to the relationship between Christ and His divinity and the bigger picture of the Godhead, these statements emerge as a response to outside pressures. People who are like, ah, there's something to this God thing, but I can't reconcile this three and one deal. And so here is a way to relieve that tension. We'll just conceive of God this way. No, no, no, no, no. The Christians come back and they're like, no, that is not the faith that was handed down to us. That's not what our sacred texts say. We can't reconcile that even with the Old Testament text. No, you got to say it this other way. And so this is back and forth there. There's a back and forth with people within Christianity as well. And there's a back and forth with the already very well circulated and well established New Testament scriptures because you get language like Matthew 11, 27. Well, how does this work? All things have been committed to be by my father. That sounds like two entities. No one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son. Well, that sounds very exclusive. Where does the Holy Spirit fit into that? And those to whom the son chooses to reveal him. Okay, so the son has a unique role here where it's his job to decide who is going to have their eyes opened to understanding the uniqueness of the relationship between the father and the son. There's a lot going on here. And so these creeds aren't just a way to fend off bad ideas or ideas that Christians reject. Let's put it that way. Just as much the creeds are an attempt to use language to somehow precisely characterize this very complex idea that is right at the boundaries of what the finite mind can comprehend or even conceive of. You've probably heard of the three big classical creeds from ancient Christianity. You'll hear him phrased just a little bit differently, but whether you're a Christian or not, notice how careful they are to frame the question we're trying to sort through as we wrestle with the implications of Jesus' words in Matthew 1127. The Nicene Creed in its original form is a product of a church council called by the Emperor Constantine at the location of what I believe was his summer palace in modern day Turkey. And it was to settle. What do you know? A question about the nature of God. There was a guy named Arius in North Africa in Egypt. He wasn't even a bishop. I think he was just some guy, a minister of some sort. He was saying that Jesus is the first and greatest of God's creations. And well, that's not what the Bible says. And that's not what the rest of Christendom was saying. But this idea is spreading that Jesus is not in full knowledge of God. He's not fully God and fully man. He's something different. Okay. So they all get together to sort the thing out. It might seem nitpicky to you, but my guess is that if you're here and you're hanging out, you understand the weight of that. And if you're not fully tracking with the weight of it, I think you'll understand more as we read further through Matthew. So the Nicene Creed is produced in 325 coming out of the Council of Nicaea where the teachings of Arius were condemned. So the Nicene Creed acknowledging that it was refined in its language in 381 at Constantinople goes like this and just listen for how much of this is dealing with exactly the questions that come out of Matthew 1127. We believe in one God, the father, the almighty maker of heaven and earth of all that is seen and unseen. We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made. See, they're pushing back on Arius of one being with the father of one being with the father through him. All things were made for us and for our salvation. He came down from heaven by the power of the Holy Spirit. He became incarnate from the Virgin Mary and was made man. For our sake, he was crucified under Pontius Pilate. He suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life who proceeds from the Father and the Son. There was some controversy about that phrase. With the Father and the Son, he is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the prophets. We believe in one holy Catholic lowercase Catholic and apostolic church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen. There's so much in there that I'd love to nuance and break down. But for our purposes and what we're looking at in Matthew 1127, you can see why this document is important. It's hard to thread that needle and say all of that stuff right. The earliest recording of one of the other really big ancient creeds, the Apostles' Creed dates to the late fourth century in a letter from a church leader named Ambrose. I'm pretty sure. But it predates that by a mile because in that letter, I really do think it's Ambrose of Milan. He is saying that he's repeating something that's been handed down generation to generation by Christians. Unlike Ambrose who had a role in mentoring a guston of hippo, one of the great big church leaders, it's not like he's saying, I just made up this creed here, repeat it. He's trying to characterize this creed that had been handed down, which would have read at that point something like this. I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Catholic church, lowercase c, probably the Roman Catholics would put a capital C there. I don't know for sure. The communion of the saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting. Amen. And then there's one more really big, much longer ancient creed. Now I just don't have time in the episode to get to that. The Athination Creed, but you can Google all of this stuff and track it down for yourself. My point is this, Matthew 1127 made a lot of work for people. They had to wrestle hard with philosophy and theology and language and reason and abstraction and try to overcome or rather lean into their platonic or Aristotelian notions about how the world works and the world of ideas work and now matter and essence works and how things could be one thing but separate things at the same time and to try to push back on a bajillion different ways to say this that sounds Christian-ish but really isn't it. For all intents and purposes, these creeds are the most agreed upon boundary markers for what is historical Christianity and what isn't. And I understand that it's very irritating and off-putting to some more recent fringe groups from the last hundred years, two hundred years, when you define it that way. But when you look at the history of what went into really nailing down who the God of Christianity actually is and coming to a global agreement on what that means and what the text is definitely saying about that, when you understand that history, I think the best way to respond to those more fringe groups that would fall outside the boundaries of these creeds is to be like, look, you can believe whatever you want about God or your life, it's your world, do whatever you want to do. But these historically are the fences of Christianity. If you're doing something beyond these definitions, it's Christian-ish. It has Christian influences or impulses or is similar in some ways to Christianity but is kind of a different religion because you're talking about kind of a different God. I know I just waited into crazy deep water, like three aggressive charging steps but then the water was really cold and now I'm back pedaling out real quick. I'm like, I'm sorry, that's all the further into that deep water we can get into right now and I know that might be unsatisfying but hopefully there's enough here in this conversation to keep us moving forward and to have a framework together for thinking about how Christianity, the Bible, early Christians, recent Christians, all of them understand the nature of this three in one God that can be a pretty confusing thing. Thanks for hanging out with me and grinding through this concept of the Trinity. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
