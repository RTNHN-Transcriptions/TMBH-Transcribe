 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we are in the middle of a couple of conversations we're having looking at the vastly wildly underrated prophet, Zechariah, and connecting the dots between big picture stuff that was going on in his book of the Old Testament with the book of Matthew, like in terms of big broad story strokes. And also we're getting towards some of the very specific things that Zechariah says that just go down in the book of Matthew. And I don't know that we're going to have time to cover every single one of them, but we're going to get you a lot of them. So let's pick it back up with that conversation now. This underrated prophet, Zechariah, doesn't just have smoking gun versus that point to the Messiah that get quoted in Matthew, but the motifs and the themes of the story also clearly point to Matthew. So you think about Jesus first public words in the sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes. Remember the last of the Beatitudes, the one that kind of transitions out of the Beatitudes structure and into other things. It's the one about blessed are you when people persecute you and mistreat you and say all kinds of awful things about you because of me, rejoice and be glad for great as your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Well, that's kind of the same opening shot across the bow that you get in the book of Zechariah. And so you've got that parallel motif to Zechariah on the front end of Jesus words and then real close to the back end of Jesus words in Matthew 21. He tells a parable that's located by the way right next door to that business we were looking at from Psalm 118 from the Egyptian Hallelujah yesterday or the day before whenever that was about the stone that causes people to stumble and the does crushing and that you can get crushed against the parable that comes right before that is also very Zechariah nene in style in that it's the parable about the landowner who owns the vineyard and he's like, all right, it was time to collect the rent because I got tenants over there and he starts sending servants and the servants mistreat and abuse all of the people who come in the name of the master and then eventually he sends his own son. And of course they kill his own son and the Pharisees are brought to their knees in this conversation as they have to acknowledge that like, yeah, you really can't do that. And the master is going to be really unhappy when he goes and interacts with those tenants and he's going to punish them harshly. This is also very Zechariah nene in its style in that it is following this familiar format in that it evokes this same central theme of Zechariah that being in the past God sent people to tell you about his will and what it looked like to get it right in his kingdom and all of that stuff and you didn't like it. You abused them. You got it wrong. And then the rest of Zechariah, of course, is just loaded with these hints that point toward the ultimate messenger, like to go back to the parable in Matthew 21, the son who is going to show up as the representative and the rest of Zechariah is also loaded with indications, hints about what is going to happen to that son who was sent as the ultimate messenger of the king. So look, when I say the Zechariah is underrated, again, I don't just mean because of the smoking gun prophecies that neatly one to one correspond is because the themes overlap so much as well. And Matthew seems to be going out of his way. Jesus seems to be going out of his way to point out these parallels to what was said by the prophet Zechariah, which was spoken into a situation after the captivity in the sixth century BC when God's people didn't have their head screwed on straight. They couldn't make sense of the point or the plan or the role they were supposed to be playing and they had to be grabbed by the shoulders and shaken vigorously in order to sort through silly things that didn't matter from the things that they needed to be and they need to be doing in order to be on task. But now let's pivot from talking about the things that are more subtle in Zechariah to talking about more of those smoking guns that I keep referencing that are there because there are a ton of those as well. And here are some of the most overt ones. Zechariah 3, 8. I'm going to read it to you with my voice from this book I got here. It says, listen, oh, high priest Joshua and your associate seated before you who are men symbolic of things to come. I'm going to bring my servant the branch. See the stone I have set in front of Joshua. There are seven eyes on that one stone and I will engrave an inscription on it. It says the Lord almighty and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day. Some of that Old Testament prophet language about eyes and things like that. You can get a little bit confusing. That requires a deeper breakdown of some of these prophets, but you're tracking with the imagery there, right? We're drawing on that motif of the stone again that we looked at in Psalm 118, that corner stone idea that causes people to stumble, that people strike themselves against, that people crash against. The Jesus says, blessed is the man who doesn't stumble over it because of me, that Jesus warns that the disciples are going to stumble. It looks like he's invoking the same language, the stone thing. Zechariah three also invokes the prophet who references the Messiah the most, which is Isaiah. And there's an illusion here to a chapter of Isaiah that we talked about a whole bunch earlier on in the book of Matthew. Isaiah 11 one, a shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse. Jesse was David's dad from his roots, a branch capital B in this translation will bear fruit. The spirit of the Lord will rest upon him. The spirit of wisdom of understanding the spirit of counsel and of power, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord, and he will delight in the fear of the Lord. And then there's a whole bunch of language that sounds almost like a return to the peace of Eden. And then in Isaiah 10 11, it says, in that day, the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples, the nations will rally to him and his place of rest will be glorious. And that day, the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the remnant that has left of his people from Assyria, from lower Egypt, from Upper Egypt, from Kush, from Milam, from Babylonia, from Hamath, from the islands of the sea. He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel. He will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four corners of the earth. And then at the end of the chapter says, there will be a highway for the remnant of his people that is left from Assyria as there was for Israel when they came up from Egypt. So you can see Isaiah is drawing on all kinds of imagery from around the rest of the Old Testament. But this is one of those passages that we talked about so often in the early going in the Book of Matthew. This says, there's a glimmer of hope. It looks like both kingdoms are done and shot and things are never going to be right again. And God's promise that he's going to redeem with this king who's going to rule over this great kingdom with upside down values that's going to be descended from the throne of David. And this kingdom is never going to go away. It looks like that can't be fulfilled, but prophecies like this one in Isaiah 11 are suggesting, no, no, no, it still is going to be fulfilled. And what looks like a dead burnt out stump isn't actually. So then you get to the beginning of the Book of Matthew and you get the lineage of Jesus being from David and you get people calling Jesus the son of David. It always seems to be people who seem like they shouldn't be able to see, but they're the ones you can see that he is the son of David, like the Canaanite woman or the blind guys in chapter, you know, whatever it is, nine or 10. I think it's probably 10. And that little jaunt down memory lane with Matthew and Isaiah is one that again, I'm bringing up because of the first of the smoking gun prophecies that I want to point out in Zachariah, Zachariah three, eight that we just read, which once again says, Joshua and your associates here before you're going to be men symbolic of things to come, I am going to bring my servant the branch and then see the stone. Those two images have been all over the Book of Matthew. And when Matthew dips back into the Old Testament to point out that Jesus is the fulfillment of prophecy. So often it's the fulfillment of those two things. He is descended from David. He is the centerpiece of the entire redemptive plan. I'm now realizing and accepting that we're not going to get into the full depth of every single thing in the book of Zachariah because we're working on Matthew, not Zachariah, but we still got more that I want to unpack because I feel like what's happening in Zachariah, both big picture wise and specifically really undergirds a lot of what's happening in Matthew and that Zachariah is being drawn upon by both Matthew and Jesus to say, look, the situation that was going on there, what was wrong with God's people's brain in that situation parallels very closely what is going wrong with the religious establishment right now. And the deliverance that was needed to sort out what was wrong back then is being fully realized right now in Jesus. So I think it's worth a little more time. We're going to take one more day on it. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
