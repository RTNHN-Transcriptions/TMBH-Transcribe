 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and here is a true and simple statement about stories. The better you understand the bad guy, the better you understand the story. In the spirit of that, we are trying to better understand the human character who is probably most responsible for the execution of Jesus of Nazareth. What makes him tick? We are talking about a guy named Kiafis. He is the one in charge at the highest level. All of the religious stuff that is going on at this time in history that we are looking at in Matthew 26, 3 through 5 where it says the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Kiafis, and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him, but not during the feast they said or there may be a riot among the people. So yesterday, we started looking at the 2000 years plus of historical religious cultural weight that this guy probably felt like he was carrying around on his shoulders. We talked about how the high priesthood is traceable all the way back to the very earliest parts of the book of Genesis and how that traceability is seemingly confirmed in Hebrews chapter 10. I had to look it up yesterday and now I can't remember again today. It's five, right? Hebrews 5 is where you get the Melchizedek stuff. Six. Nope. Five. Hebrews 5 seems to confirm the same idea that this notion of a priesthood that is that there is a class, a cast of people in society who are intermediaries in terms of sacrifices and religious teaching and leadership intermediaries between God and his chosen people, but that there's also somebody who's really in charge, a high priest who is entitled to enter into the most holy parts of the tabernacle and then eventually the temple and whose job it is to perform sacrifices on behalf of the people as a nation. This is a very, very, very important role, oftentimes more important even than kings. As we discussed yesterday, after the era of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob's kids, we see that Jacob's kids through a very complicated family situation provide us with 12 tribes, the structure of the early days of Israel moving forward. In addition to these 12 landed tribes, you have a 13th tribe that doesn't get land, but the high priests come from this tribe. These are the descendants of Levi or the Levites. Now, for the longest time in the history of tribal Israel, it doesn't look like the selecting of the priests and the high priests was all that tricky. Things get more complicated once you have kings involved starting in the, what would it be, late 11th century BC, King Saul, King David, and there's a prophet in the Old Testament who even warned the people when they were demanding a king. He's like, I don't know, it's going to change stuff. Right now, God is king and sometimes you listen and sometimes you don't, but if you get a human king, they are going to world kingdom you, they are going to government you, and maybe eventually it'll seem normal. But when you really step back and think about what kings do to you, it's not the best. Are you sure? And the people are like, heck yeah, everybody else got one of them's. We want one of them's too. And so it's like, okay, you can have kings. And sure enough, it is a disaster with very few exceptions. It only takes like two and a half, three rounds of kings and the kingdom spirals into civil war and is split into two separate kingdoms, the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah, Solomon is effectively the last king of the unified kingdoms. So Saul, David Solomon, that's all you get. And then these tribes split up. Ten of those tribes go north. It's easier to say which two tribes stay south as Judah and Benjamin stay south. And historically, the opinion is that Benjamin is effectively absorbed into Judah eventually. Well, the northern and southern kingdoms, they fight like crazy in the DNA of the northern kingdom is the bizarre rebelliousness of Solomon's sons, which as a side note, it's always been a weird troubling thing for me because the first chunk of the book of Proverbs is all Solomon giving like fatherly advice to his kid. And I'm pretty sure that the kid he's giving all of this advice for what wisdom looks like to had a civil war and engaged in intrigue and like attempted assassinations and divided up his dad's kingdom. And it's a very strange, very decisive moment in the history of the Old Testament story to look at because like the wisest king ever has idiot kids. And it so millennia, maybe even forever of discord and ruin because of the decisions that happened there. The northern kingdom and southern kingdom ally at times, southern kingdom is Judah, northern kingdom is Israel, they fight at other times. And sometimes they make weird alliances with outsiders that get them in trouble. There are prophets who come and go during this time and they're like trying to keep people on track, but the kings are just such a mess. Most of them do super wicked stuff, even involved themselves in the most vile, violent, horrible, evil, pagan, sacrificial wickedness as recorded in the Old Testament. And eventually the series of escalating judgments from God escalates all to the way to the point when the Assyrian king Tiglith Pylessar comes in and even according to the biblical account, he whoops up on his formal vassal state. That is that the northern kingdom had started paying tribute and they were just in bed with and under the thumb of the Assyrians and the Assyrians were big and bad and mean and they did not mess around. And so in 732 and in the ensuing years, the northern kingdom is completely wiped out and 10 tribes are taken into exile and assimilated somewhere in the ancient Near East, like northern modern day Iraq and they just go away. They're lost to history. So obviously that's going to be a little bit disruptive toward the lineage of the priesthood in the north, but still there's continuity with the Levite high priesthood in the south in Judah, the remaining kingdom. Judah holds out for a long time, like another 150 years. Assyria goes away. They get replaced by the neo-Babylonian empire, Nebuchadnezzar. The second Nebuchadnezzar is the rock star of that empire. And eventually in the 580s, things go afoul there because Judah can't keep its head screwed on straight and Nebuchadnezzar comes, conquers Jerusalem and takes everybody away into captivity in Babylon. The high priesthood seems to continue to exist during this time in exile. It's not too long after Nebuchadnezzar's conquest in 539 BC that we see Cyrus the great of the Medes and the Persians from further east come in. They defeat the Babylonians. This is the stuff recorded in Daniel 5 where Belshazzar sees the writing on the wall and dies that very night and his kingdom is given to Darius the Mede. So now the Persians are in charge and the Persians are much friendlier than the Assyrians or the Babylonians and they are very much interested in the remaining Israelite people, the tribe of Judah and the assimilated tribe of Benjamin, continue to have their own identity. And so the priesthood is sustained through that as well. But now the priesthood, it's kind of in a split situation because it needs to continue to function somehow in the east because there's now such a huge Jewish presence in Persia. But also it needs to function in this new smaller second temple that is being built back in the west in Jerusalem. And so the high priests still tracing their connection to the tribe of Levi are functioning on a smaller scale for a smaller people group in the fifth century and the fourth century. But then Alexander the Great turns everything on its head in the late 300s BC, including walking into Jerusalem, bloodlessly and liberating it, conquering it. I don't know that anybody really wanted to be liberated from the Persians. The Persians had been pretty much fine. But that's what happens. And then after that, Alexander the Great dies, doesn't name an heir and his Greek slash Macedonian generals divide up Alexander's gigantic empire bigger than anything the world has ever seen, bigger than Persia, bigger than Babylon, bigger than Assyria, bigger than Egypt, just massive. They divide the whole thing up into their own little version of tribes and two different descendants of the generals of Alexander the Great rule over the Jewish people in the coming century and a half and it gets more and more contentious all the way to the point where there's a rebellion to reestablish a Jewish kingdom that is successful in the second century BC. But in the midst of all of that turmoil, we see that the Greek overlords start realizing the importance of the Jewish high priesthood and they're like, yeah, we're going to start appointing those ourselves. And so we just see a flip where somewhere in like, I think it's in the early second century, the high priest go from having real Jewish sounding names to having real Greek sounding names like Jason, straight up my middle name. I just don't think of that as sounding very like Hebrew high priesty, but whatever, that's what they did. And that was in keeping with this Greek impulse to inflict Greek culture on everybody. Interesting. The Greeks get this great rap. The Persians get this bad rap, but the Greeks were far more aggressive in that regard, whereas the Persians were content to rule you, but also leave you alone. It's an interesting historical contrast. And with that little historical aside said, I've decided that I need one more day to flesh out this backstory for Kaiaphas, the high priest. So I'm going to take one more day. I think we're going to have a lovely time. I know I always say it and maybe I always say it because I just can't believe there's anybody who's excited about doing the historical deep dives and the backstory stuff. So I'm going to say it again. Thank you for being up for that. I think it's such an important part of what we do. And I think it's really, really interesting and fun. And I like digging into it. Yeah, you all are awesome. We're going to do more of this tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. We'll see you again soon.
