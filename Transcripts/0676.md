 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and this is one of those days where you get a disclaimer warning because it's just, I don't know, there's going to be more offensive things in this conversation than usual. I don't think they're actually offensive at all, but you know, you get kids and stuff and you listen together and I don't want to make decisions for you. So yeah, maybe preview this one first. Do you ever wonder when I say that if it's because I really think there's a chance that I'm going to destroy your kids' childhood or if maybe I just want you to sit there and wonder what the offensive thing that we're going to say based on the passage that's up next might be. I don't know. It could be both. It's possible. Here's the thing. When I was in high school, there was a first baseman named John Cruck who was playing the Major League Baseball and there was a pitcher named Mitch Williams. I think they were both on the Philadelphia Phillies at the same time. And if I recall correctly, there was a game where John Cruck is playing defense over at first base and Mitch Williams steps off the rubber. That's where the pitcher's pitch from and he throws over to first base in an attempt to catch the runner off the base. It's called a pick-off move and the throw got away from Mitch Williams and bounced in the dirt and it came up and John Cruck couldn't field it cleanly and it hit him right in his protective cup, which if you don't know what that is, as my coaches used to say when I was a little guy, here's offensive thing. Number one, it protects the family jewels. Well, it kind of protected the family jewels for John Cruck as the story goes, but the cup was lost in the incident. It shattered. It was broken never to be used again. I don't know. Maybe they put that in the Hall of Fame. They should have put that in the Hall of Fame. There should be a display of John Cruck's shattered cup because what happened was, you know, he's in pain and agony and suffering. And so they take him to the hospital to check that out and make sure everything's just fine down there. And what they discover is everything is not just fine down there. Dude had testicular cancer or something else. It was real wrong. I don't remember exactly what it was. And they had to do a whole bunch of surgery in a turn out. It was like a really big deal. And I don't know if this is totally true or not, but kind of the legend was that Mitch Williams and the shattering cup may have saved John Cruck's life. Speaking of cups of suffering, in Matthew chapter 26, Jesus invokes language that is used throughout the Bible about the association of cups and their content and suffering. I'm pretty sure these are the kind that you drink things out of. But the NIV, it doesn't use the language of suffering. Some other translations actually spell that out, even though my understanding is that the phrase cup of suffering is not present in the original Greek here in Matthew 26. It's still very clearly what he's talking about. And it's not the first time the concept of the cup of suffering is used in the Bible. I apologize for everything that just happened. The next part is going to work. I totally promise. Okay, so then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, that's James and John, along with him and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me. Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, my father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me, yet not as I will, but as you will. Then he returned to his disciples and found him sleeping. Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour? He asked Peter. Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak. He went away a second time and prayed, my father, if it's not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done. I don't think I'm like some sort of literary genius interpretation guy or anything, but even when I was a kid without being familiar with much of anything else in the Bible, I think I got what he meant there, right? Maybe you caught what he meant right at the beginning too? Like, I don't know how you use cup as a metaphor for suffering. It's not the most natural metaphor for suffering, but contextually I was able to piece it together and I'm like, oh, that cup, that somehow represents the thing that he's about to go through. But as the years have gone by, I've discovered that this whole cup being associated with suffering, but the cup also being associated with blessing, the overflow of God's salvation and deliverance, that these two uses of this imagery is actually pretty prevalent around the Bible. And obviously the whole cup of suffering thing is something that we've heard most recently come up just a few chapters earlier in Matthew chapter 20, the sons of Zebedee, James and John, their mom, this is the scene where she comes up and it's like, hey, what if we give my kids seats at your right and left hand? That would be great. You don't know what you're asking, Jesus said to them, can you drink the cup I'm going to drink? Oh, we can, they answered. Jesus said to them, yeah, you'll indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant these places belong to those for whom they've been prepared by my father. So in this scenario, it's almost like James and John and maybe their mom as well heard the cup metaphor and they were like, oh, he's talking about the cup of like blessing and overflowing with riches and wealth and the Psalm 23, my cup runneth over, you know, I my head with oil, surely goodness and mercy, all that positive connotation of the cup thing and their brain did not go to the suffering, even though he'd been explaining the suffering was coming and they were like, oh, yeah, heck yeah, we can do that or maybe they did think of suffering and much like Peter, they were thumping their chests and they were like, wow, Peter, he boasts about things that seems to work real well for him. We would be like that. Yeah, we can totally do that. I will drink that cup. Bring it. Let's do it right now. And Jesus is pretty polite considering that he knows what's coming and they clearly just don't get the magnitude of it pivots the metaphor just a little bit. So instead of saying that they're going to drink from the cup, he's going to drink from instead says you will indeed drink from my cup feels like there are some blast supper, Eucharistic Lord's Supper communion overtones, maybe there, but it also feels like both sides of what this cup is throughout the use of the biblical metaphor, the blessing side and the suffering side. It seems like both of those are probably present in what he's saying they're going to drink that is his. But as promised buzz around and look at some different Bible stuff here from the Old Testament another spot in the New Testament where this cup language gets employed. Psalm 16, this one's written by David, somebody who experienced both aspects of that cup for sure. He says, keep me safe. Oh God, for you, I take refuge. I say to the Lord, you're my Lord apart from you. I have no good thing as for the saints who are in the land. They are the glorious ones in whom is all my delight. The sorrows of those will increase who run after other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood or take up their names on my lips. So you can see that cup and pouring out metaphor there. Here's where it gets real explicit. Verse five, Lord, you've assigned me my portion and my cup. You have made my lot secure. This point in his life, David would have experienced suffering and blessing. And it's possible that thematically what he's saying here is that same concept of you give and take away that God is good and just and right, whether it is a time of suffering or a time of blessing. Either way, it seems like it fits with the use of the cup language throughout the rest of the Bible. For example, I'm in our hear Psalm 75 almost. Got it. There we are. And verse eight, this one is not by David. This one is by Asaph in verse eight. It says, in the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs. So there it sounds like we're definitely getting a talk about the judgment of God that doesn't sound like blessing at all. Then we're going to jump over here to Jeremiah 25 15 suffering comes up a decent amount in this book. So it's not hard to guess how the metaphor of the cup will be invoked here. But this is what the Lord, the God of Israel said to me, take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them. So I took the cup from the Lord's hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it. And for the next little chunk of time in Jeremiah 25, this drink of this cup of suffering and judgment that theme is pretty thick. It's repeated on a whole bunch of different levels. Okay. Isaiah 51, just a few pages back. Verse 17 again, this use of the cup metaphor is the cup of suffering side. Make awake, rise up, O Jerusalem, you have drunk from the hand of the Lord, the cup of his wrath. You who have drained to its dregs of the goblet that makes men stagger. This is very similar as you keep reading in Isaiah 51 to how Jeremiah uses this language in Jeremiah 25. And then even at the very end of the Bible in Revelation 17, and this is one of those places where I warned you, I'm going to say words that you might have to have a conversation with your kids about. What famous whore of Babylon material in Revelation 17 about this metaphorical woman who is representative of the world system being unmasked for all of its evil and destructiveness and wickedness in contrast to the values of the kingdom and the kingdom system that we're learning about from Jesus and that Jesus is initiating. And I think this language is so different and it's so foreign if you've never read it before, but I'll give you a little sample of it anyway. When the angel carried me away in the spirit into a desert, there I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. I had why not read that stuff. It's so interesting. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and was glittering with gold precious stones and pearls. Here we go. She held a golden cup in her hand filled with abominable things and the filth of her adultries. This title was written on her forehead mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth. I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. And at this point you might be like, where is the part where the cup is a metaphor for like the blessing of God and good stuff? Because you said that was kind of a thing too. Well, we just saw that in Matthew 26, right? This cup is the new covenant in my blood. And that language right there is certainly demonstrative of it. But also in Psalm 116, very famously verse 13, I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord. Clearly in Matthew 26, we are talking more about the John Crook side of the cup, the one that involves suffering. But weirdly, oh yeah, I'm doing this. Like you can plug your ears and scream or you can turn it off right now, but I'm going to land this play in the same way we started it. But in the same way that the cup is both representative to John Crook of suffering and deliverance. So it is throughout the Bible, but it's not hard at all to see which side of that metaphor is being invoked here in Matthew 26. Clearly at the table, the cup is the picture of deliverance, though it's a scary picture of deliverance and one that involves the blood of Christ. Clearly here as we get out into the garden, the cup is representative of the suffering or specifically the judgment and wrath of God and that judgment and wrath of God, much like Socrates drinking the hemlock is something that Christ is going to ingest. He's going to take all of that upon himself into himself and the judgment of God against sin and failure and all of the wrongness that is manifest in the behavior of the whore of Babylon all the way at the end of the Bible. All of that wrath against evil and injustice and wrongdoing is going to be poured out on Christ. That is what we see shaping up for how the redemptive plan is going to unfold. And so the attentive member, the original audience at this point would have done way better than I did the first time I encountered this was like, Oh, cup. All right. Well, I don't get how, but it's some kind of metaphor for suffering or what he's going through for somebody who's steeped in the Old Testament and the rest of the Bible as they read this for the first time in the early days of Christianity, they would have been like, Oh, nang, that's just not pain and suffering. That's the language it gets used for the judgment and wrath of God against evil. And it's about to be poured out on its own son. Yeah, I understand why he would say if there's any other way interesting. I think someday far from now, I'm going to be sitting on a porch looking at a sunset with grandkids, maybe cut willing great grandkids, thinking back about my life and the beautiful things and the decisions I made. And maybe right then in that moment, it will cross my mind that I chose to use Mitch Williams hitting John Crook in the cup that time in spring training to illustrate this important passage here in Matthew 26. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
