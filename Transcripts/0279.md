 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and I love sports. And one of the reasons that I think I love sports so much is that it's scheduled actual real life drama. I go and watch The Mandalorian on TV, which I love, but the drama is artificial. I know it's going to work out even if we end on a cliffhanger with this episode or that episode. Like in the end, there's going to be fan service and we're going to feel good because I know the genre and I know how it works. Whereas if I go into a football game rooting for the Colorado buffaloes, the Denver Broncos or the Denver Nuggets, so the Colorado Avalanche, I don't even bother trying to root for the Colorado Rockies anymore. I don't know what I'm going to get. They could surprise me. They could dazzle me. A great player could make more great plays and that unscheduled no guaranteed outcome drama is really fun, but it also lends itself to this fascinating human social phenomenon. The what have you done for me lately phenomenon where it doesn't matter how good somebody has been in the past. You're still like, Hey, you got to show me something. Peyton Manning, late in his career. He has a legendary quarterback playing football for the Denver Broncos already, but he has a pretty rough last season. I mean, I suppose everybody wishes their rough final season could end in a Super Bowl victory, but people were hitting him left and right every week with the old, what have you done for me lately thing and Peyton Manning who had like held almost every record for quarterbacks at that point in history still had to go and face the media and the fans and the talking heads on the radio every week and explain, you know, why he's trying his hardest and things didn't go exactly the way you want. And you could tell he wanted to remind them like you guys remember all that stuff that I did before that was like, I don't know, awesome. The stuff that caused you to even imagine that you could have these expectations for me. Like I'm still that guy. You can just go watch the tape. It was very recent. I don't know if if that didn't impress you, which was literally the best quarterbacking in the history of quarterbacking. I guess I don't know what is going to impress you, but he never said that. He retained its dignity for the most part. And it's part of the reason I'm a really big fan of that guy. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 12, Jesus is getting hit with the old, what have you done for me lately? Yeah. Well, maybe you're cool, but you're going to need to prove it again. mentality. And the way we get to this is fascinating because the religious leaders are getting embarrassed at every turn in Matthew chapter 12. They look like chumps when they go and pick arbitrary nonsensical fights over things that are either a harmless or B obviously redemptively good because of what day of the week they happen on. And after those two Sabbath controversies, Jesus is like, cool. If you all want to murder me over that, I guess I don't want to be murdered right now. I'm just going to go out in the country or something, but people have Jesus fever. So they follow him out there and they want to see what he's doing. And Jesus heals a demon possessed guy and the crowds are like, dang, I can tell you what have you done for me lately. You've done amazing things that break the laws of time and space right in front of my eyes. And they all look like the things that were supposed to happen with the Messiah who would be the centerpiece of God's redemptive plan. And therefore I'm starting to suspect that you might be the son of God, the Messiah, the one who straightens all this stuff out. But the Pharisees are like, no, all that good stuff you're doing. That's by the power of Satan that you're doing things that countermand the orders and effectiveness of Satan. And Jesus is like, well, that's stupid. And he refutes it very nimbly and very quickly. And then he pivots to the offense as we've looked at over the last couple of days. And he's like, you guys have seen the incontrovertible, miraculous work of God right in front of your faces, the work of God that looks just like the stuff that is predicted in the servant songs of Isaiah that you all know that if somebody could come and do that, they are the Messiah. You guys saw that and yet you still chose to attribute that to literally Satan come on. Then Jesus doubles down even harder on the Pharisees being like, hey, you guys can't just weasel out of this being like, oh, no, that was just a careless whisper. I didn't mean to say that. No, you meant it. And out of the abundance of your heart, your mouths are speaking, your words are precisely representative of what is going on in the depths of who you are. And at that point, if you're the Pharisees, what do you do? You could leave the battlefield. That would be one option. Just this is embarrassing. Come on, guys, we've seen the go and regroup. But to do that is essentially just forfeit the point. He like Jesus was right about all that stuff and you're doing it in front of all these people. These are the people who fund your operation and who give you credibility. They're in a terrible spot of their own making. They can't flee the battlefield. They can't really come back at Jesus and be like, what? No, that's not what we meant or try to argue with them on the Satan point. He crushed them on that point. So instead, they go with the role of the critic. Well, your last film might have been good, but how is this one looking? Well, you might have played football really well for the last 12 seasons and set all the records, but what have you done for me lately? So they try to save face and recover the point with the, what have you done for me lately technique, which goes like this starting in verse 38 and that's the only verse we're going to get through today. Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you. And on the surface, that might sound nice, but we're going to break down why it's actually a dumpster fire here in just a second. But let's start with a narrative question. When is this happening? If you're reading a new international version translation, which is what I'm drawing from today, then you'll notice the word then is the very next thing after Jesus finishes his speech at the Pharisees, calling them a brood of vipers and all the stuff that we've been talking about. But if you are in the, is it the new living translation that I saw? I think it is the new living translation that has it rendered as one day. Then I'm like, okay, well, that's pretty different. One day in one translation gives the impression that Matthew is doing that thing he does from time to time where he edits things together, which is totally a valid way to tell a story and to edit your book. But it does kind of change the meaning. If we mean one day, that means that some other point this happened and we'll still glean a lot from the ensuing passage. But if then, as this word is rendered in the NIV is the better translation, then that changes the way we interpret this exchange. It's coming up a little bit because it means that it's like the very next thing that happened in this larger tettate that Jesus is having with the Pharisees. I've got this Greek New Testament here that I like to act like I know how to read to impress people at parties, but I secretly only sort of know how to read. And then we go to verse 38. Tao, Omicron, Tao, Epsilon is the way it spelled, totae. I guess is the way you would say that. And so I don't know for sure what that word means off the top of my head. So then the next thing a hack like me would have to do is go over here. Analytical Greek lexicon is a Greek dictionary. All the words that are in the Bible that are in the Greek and they just flip to it. And there it is. T-t-otae. Not sure I'm saying that right. Of time, then, at that time, then, or there upon. So from my money, it looks like based on these Greek resources, the NIV rendering makes more sense. It looks like this is the ensuing event. But some of my seminary professors were on the new living translation team. So I don't know. They probably had a good reason for doing it the way they did and they're way smarter than me. You can make of all this whatever you want to me. It looks like we are flowing directly from one half of the conversation, straight into the next half of the conversation. But I'm not just saying that because my reader's Greek New Testament third edition Bible says that it uses that word. I'm also saying that because the context indicates that. It looks like the Pharisees are trying to pivot towards something that makes them look very charitable and open-minded to the squishy middle crowds and to the people who are following Jesus who just heard them get told off. And so they're like, okay, well, if all of these things are from the spirit, as you say, and you say they're miraculous things, well, then just show us one of those. Go ahead and do it. Well, the problem with that is that he just did. That's the thing that spawned the entire controversy in the first place, is you had a guy who everybody in the region who knew him would have acknowledged was demon possessed. And even if they weren't sure what to make the spiritual side of that, as I'm sure many of us today are not quite sure what to make of it, he was definitely blind and mute. Surely people had tested that out. Surely that dude had like a family or somebody you could ask. And they also get fixed. And the crowds, even the squishy middle crowds are like, yeah, that's pretty compelling. But the Pharisees aren't. So they just got what they're now asking for. It would be like Peyton Manning throwing for four touchdowns and 350 yards on a Sunday. And then I ran into Peyton Manning at the grocery store on a Tuesday. I was like, Hey, what's up, P man? Nice football, buddy. But I got some questions about your legitimacy and your long term viability as a quarterback. In order for me to believe in you, I'm going to need to see north of 350 yards and four touchdowns next time out. Like if Peyton Manning could maintain his composure at that point, think he would need to look at me and be like, literally my last outing two days ago meets the criteria that you have artificially created out of thin air for quote, believing in me. Well, what do you want me to do? I haven't even had a game sense then. Likewise, we get here and the Pharisees are coming back. And on the surface again, it looks like, Oh, well, that's nice of them. They're really interested in learning more about Jesus, miraculous powers and who he might be. But that's not what's happening. This is a clumsy attempt to try to save face demanding something that he literally just got done doing and it made them mad. So if you think about the situation here socially, and if you can imagine being in Jesus' shoes, I can imagine that you would need to take a very long series of deep breaths and count to 10 to try to cope with this level of idiocy and goofy, utterly transparent, false, manipulative behavior. Bottom line, as I've said before, I really do feel a degree of empathy toward the Pharisees, but this is an awful showing. And they are coming off as clearly the bad guys and clearly in the wrong in this passage. We're hitting pause there. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon, my friends.
