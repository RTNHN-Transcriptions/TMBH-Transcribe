 Hello, my name is Matt Whitman. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and the Stanley Cup champions this year, the Colorado Avalanche. That just happened a couple days ago and I'm still euphoric about it. And I've been rooting for that team since the very first day that they came to Colorado. And it's been a long time since they've won a cup and they won the cup and I give myself complete permission if my team wins a championship to yell and scream and stomp around and behave in ways that I normally don't. I just don't let myself go like that very often. And it's so much fun. It was great. They were the best team end to end all year. They cruised through the playoffs with very limited speed bumps. They played the best team. You got to beat the best to be the best and Tampa Bay Lightning who they played. They won the last two cups. They're a great team. And so for Colorado to beat them and win it, it was just awesome. And one of the things that happens in hockey culture, for those of you who haven't been around before, is that just because of the flow of the game, there's a lot of stoppages in play. And so a lot of things happen in the arena to keep the energy up. And you know, you've got if the goalie holds onto the puck or there's offside or icing or the puck goes out of play, there's a penalty or there's just a ton of reasons. Anytime there's a whistle, you're going to have to do a face off a puck drop. And you got to do something with those few seconds while you reset everything. And there's no action happening. And so you've usually got a stadium DJ that picks songs. But there's something about the hockey clientele that makes them way more up for singing along. People saying the national anthem really hard in Canada and the United States, they sing along with whoever's singing it loudly, like people in a tavern with great big tankards of beer swaying back and forth. And there's also been this thing that's happened where each team, at least teams that are having a lot of success. Gradually, there becomes kind of a good time party song that for whatever reason just clicks with that fan base. And if things are going well, usually in the third period, there are three periods in hockey, the house DJ will play that song. And everybody will just start singing along a few years ago, the St. Louis Blues, who the Avalanche beat on their way to the Stanley Cup championship this year. The St. Louis Blues had that Laura Brannigan song that if you're old, you remember it, if not, you don't. But it's a really good song. It's called Gloria and everybody would sing along with that. And that was fun. Well, for the Avalanche, it was blank one, 82's all the small things. And it was just so fun when that would come on during home games and the stretch run of the season and the playoffs. Because you know, it just means that they things are rolling. They're probably going to win. And everybody is united in this thing. Like nobody cares what everybody else in the arena thinks about this political issue or that political issue and all the things we bicker about all the time. Like we just, it's so simple. We want our team to put the biscuit in the basket more than the other team does. Go our team. And then the song comes on and everybody links arms and sings along. And you can only play the music for so long. Then when the puck drops, you got to throttle that back so the players can focus on playing hockey. But then the arena keeps singing and they go all the way through like two verses and it's a blast. And you still kind of get that, you know, if you go to church, but there just aren't many opportunities to sing along, united in purpose and cause outside of that environment. And when you do experience it, if you're not used to it, I think it's a really special thing. Thank you for indulging my desire to talk about the Colorado Avalanche. But there is a likewise here. And the likewise is this in Matthew chapter 26. After all of this last supper stuff and even the business about somebody's going to betray me, they wrap up the meal in an oft forgotten verse with a song. It's the only point that I can think of at least in the gospels where we have record of Jesus singing a song. Here's the verse Matthew 26 30. When they'd sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. That's it. That's all we're going to get through today. First of all, I just think it's cool that a room full of dudes with no instruments were like, and now we shall sing together. And also it's super sad that you're going to die like tomorrow where the next day our host and our metaphorical father of this new family here. But seems like a good time to sing. And so then they sang. And my guess is that the song was moving and meditative and bittersweet and sad in its own way. But my guess also is that the song they sang was from a chunk of the Psalms that is all about the glory of God and his power to establish his will and his kingdom and his intention to see through the things that he promises. And so they're singing, I think, and we're going to talk more about this in just a second, a song of praise to God about stuff that he's done in the past and the promise of what that means for how he'll behave in the future. But they're also doing that against the backdrop of imminent death. This is dark, but let's do the exercise anyway. Have you ever been in a situation where you're interacting with somebody you love and they are about to die? I had that experience with my grandma. I guess I interacted with my my grandpa, my other grandma, and my other grandpa all in pretty close proximity before they passed away. But I didn't know when they were going to pass away. But my grandma and my mom's side, we all knew that it was probably her last day, her closing hours. And I'm not going to share the whole story because it's super meaningful and I super miss her and it's super emotional. But when she and I exchanged our last words ever, it was bittersweet because the words were beautiful. Some of the most meaningful things anyone has ever said to me were said as she was gathering her strength for one last push to say a few things to the people who love her who were there in the room with her. But obviously there's also the bitterness of loss that's hanging right behind the beauty of those words. And I think that was the case in this room. At this point, everybody is convinced that Jesus means it that he's about to be killed, that this must happen, that it's going to happen. And so I'm guessing that not everybody was completely emotionally composed as they sang this thing, which is an interesting contrast. If they were singing the part of the Psalms that most people in the first century would have sung at this point in the Passover. For a very long time, there have been two chunks of the later Psalms that people would sing in various annual celebrations and festivals that are very famous and that would have been lodged in the heads of every kid growing up because they just sang it so much. One of those called the greater Halal picks up it like Psalm 120 goes about to Psalm 135. I don't think 119 is a part. I think 119 is a celebration of the beauty of the law of God. But then Psalm should have written this down. I don't remember for sure. I think it is 115 to 118. Maybe it's 116. You know what? I'm going to know if I just turn over there and look because the language of it kind of pops. Okay, there's 118, 117, 116. Yes, it's 115 to 118. And people have done their homework way harder than me, suppose that most likely this lesser Halal, I don't think they called it that. I think they called it the Egyptian Halal would have been what people would have sung in that environment. It echoes some of the stuff that the Hebrew people sang right after they crossed the Red Sea. It celebrates the power of God to deliver. It celebrates his consistency and his long view of things and that he keeps his promises. But another thing that's interesting about this is that especially the end of this Egyptian Halal Psalm 118 is loaded with references that have come up around the Book of Matthew. So they're kind of singing what they've lived. They're singing what Jesus has said and done. And they're singing the fulfillment of the Old Testament in keeping with what Jesus said in Matthew 5, 17, that he is the completion of all of this. All right, couple of examples of stuff from there. It's really thick right here at the end. Starting in Psalm 118, 22, you're going to recognize a bunch of this language. The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone that's Matthew 21. The Lord has done this and it's marvelous in our eyes. All of that appears in that same quote. This is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and to be glad in it. Oh, Lord, save us. Oh, Lord, grant us success. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord from the house of the Lord. We bless you. That's Matthew. Maybe Matthew 10, maybe Matthew 11. And then again, in Matthew 21. And then we read on in Psalm 118, the Lord is God and he has made his light shine upon us with bows and hand join in the festival procession up to the horns of the altar. You are my God and I will give you thanks. You were my God and I will exalt you. Give thanks to the Lord for he is good. His love endures forever. If indeed Jesus and his disciples sang what so many other people would have sung to commemorate the Passover at that point in the history of Judaism, then what we have here is a phenomenon that Luke emphasizes heavily in his gospel, which is the idea that toward the end of his time with the disciples, Jesus opened their eyes to how he was the fulfillment of the Old Testament. There's, I got to do this quick, but there's an incident after the resurrection and Luke where Jesus encounters some people who really liked Jesus but didn't recognize him because they thought he was dead. He comes back to life and they're walking on this road to Emmaus and Jesus is like, how are you doing? And they're like, well, we're sad. And Jesus is like, what are you sad about? And like, didn't you hear about Jesus thing? And Jesus is like, hmm, interesting. And then he reveals to them who he is. And they're like, what? And he opens their eyes to the scripture. And then he goes back and he encounters the disciples and he opens their eyes and they understand how it all fits together and flows. And then early in the book of Acts, which is also by Luke, we see Peter imitating this, trying to show people on the day of Pentecost, the connections between all of the old stuff and the new stuff and how Jesus is indeed the completion and fulfillment of all of that. Am I point and bring those things up? Once again, is to say that if this is what they were singing, then like their final thing that they did together before it all got busted up and they got scattered as we're going to see in the very next verse, then well, this is Jesus doing the same thing. We're seeing more of the same impulse to really connect the dots to put it right in front of them. Are you getting it? Do you understand how I am the completion of this thing and how what is about to happen is born out of the same character and consistency and goodness and impulse toward redemption that delivered you from slavery in Egypt all those years ago, which obviously would also be a very nice and fitting way to wrap up all of the symbolism and the theological point of what the Passover meal is. I can't help but wonder if they were any good. It's a bunch of fishermen and stuff. And so I think about that song that was on the cassette tape that I had of the little mermaid soundtrack with all the swarthy semen singing on the deck as they sail. About those blue and something about the little mermaid, something about boats and seas. I don't remember the song super well, but I wonder if it was like that, like kind of one of those high seas rowing songs or I wonder if maybe they were just like absolutely terrible or maybe it was just such an important moment that by the power of God everybody was super awesome and it was more like when the dwarves pulled out perfect 12 part harmony around a fireplace to just absolutely nail that Misty Mountain song. But the point is Matthew's a pretty good book and also the avalanche won the Stanley Cup. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
