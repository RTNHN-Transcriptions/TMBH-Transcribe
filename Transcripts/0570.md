 There is a moment in 1986 is Transformers the movie where the matrix of leadership is passed on from the hero of the show Optimus Prime and now the good guys the Autobots are on the run their leader lists they're largely dead or scattered and their makeshift leader who isn't really that good at leading even though he has an awesome voice is Robert stack this guy this character name is ultra Magnus and ultra Magnus has his back up against the wall and the bad guys are closing in and he pulls out the Autobot matrix of leadership and attached to this matrix of leadership there's like a prophecy a promise this says that this thing is going to light the Autobots darkest hour and ultra Magnus is like this is gotta be it look at this this is the darkest hour and he gets it out and he's pulling on the thing and even swears you can't swear in a kids cartoon movie that was first time I'd ever heard that I was scandalized but the thing doesn't open and then he gets shot a whole bunch and I was like what the heck man why even have a prophecy if it's going to be that vague how could that not be the darkest hour come on and then later the thing does open it opens for hot rod who is lame and that was a disappointing ending for me but that motif of the light your darkest hour the prophecy thing but you don't know exactly when the darkest hour is going to be because it's intentionally vague feels like that might be a little bit in play in Matthew chapter 24 Jesus is speaking about the future and how things are going to work out and we know it's really easy to tell contextually the first chunk of his answer to the disciples about what the signs of the end of times are going to be those just look like road markers like all of this stuff's going to happen it seems like they're going to be really big deals but don't panic too much about that that's just cost of doing business in the world system that doesn't mean the end is here so when Jesus says watch out that no one deceives you for many will come in my name claiming I am the Christ and will deceive many you will hear of wars and rumors of wars it makes sense then that Jesus would go on to say but see to it that you are not alarmed such things must happen and then he lists out a few more things that are going to go down just along the merry way of history as well but then as we get into this next chunk it's a touch trickier is Jesus now pivoting to specific things that are going to happen to the disciples and that means it's the end of time or is he still talking about things that are going to happen along the way except instead of generally these things will all just happen along the way of history he's saying these things will happen to you along the way be ready for that but these things are not necessarily indicative of the end of everything so to jog your memory in this next chunk Matthew 24 starting in verse nine of the Olivet discourse it looks like Jesus is redirecting his attention away from the general and towards specifically the disciples who are standing there with him when he says then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me at that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people because of the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold but he who stands firm to the end will be saved and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached to the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come well there's a really tricky word in there isn't it it's then and that then sort of corresponds to the vagueness of the matrix of leadership will light the Autobots darkest hour well when is then when is the Autobots darkest hour because it looked like it was really dark when ultra-magnetes was getting shot again and again and again but it turned out that that wasn't the end of things and the matrix of leadership didn't open tough luck Robert Stack and likewise here then could mean after you've driven down the road and you've seen some of these road markers that you just can't help but see throughout history that Jesus talks about in the first chunk it could mean after that then these things will happen and that is the end or it could mean as some hyper-intelligent bible scholars argue is the best reading of the original language that quote then should be interpreted as something more like in keeping with or along with that that it isn't necessarily a chronological order of events and I've got to say that read is pretty compelling because if we take what we just read between verses nine and fourteen about all the things about people's hearts getting cold and people turning away and being handed over and persecuted and all of that if we line that up against the last two thousand years of history what corresponds to like always like somebody is always experiencing apostasy and the church churches struggle churches thrive nations getting mad at christians christianity is almost always out of vogue somewhere so when you go and watch transformers the movie you could be like oh that right there that's the darkest hour look at that they're in a tank with a bunch of shark robots that's that's as dark as it gets i guess not oh look at that like the bunch of junk bots or chasing everything that's got to be the darkest hour that's just that's terrible no no i guess not oh i mean for crying out loud it's like the destruction of the shuttle and everybody's getting shot that's got to be no but that wasn't it either that giant planet is eating other planets that's got to be no that wasn't it either but then when the matrix of leadership finally does open you're like oh well i i guess i could see it i suppose that could be the darkest hour as well likewise here in matthew chapter 24 let's say we just look at the first century ad and what we know about what happened to the disciples over the next several decades after the events recorded here in matthew chapter 24 let me see were they handed over and persecuted oh yeah for sure like i barely even have to turn any pages like just right here at the beginning of acts like it's immediate how quickly they're getting turned over and persecuted i mean they have flogged they get their backs turned into hamburger by religious people uh so that checks out but i mean it also checks out for christians in the second century third century fourth century fifth century you get where i'm going with this let's keep reading and see how the rest of this checks out and you will be hated by all nations because of me well i guess by the end of the first century people in charge of every nation that was exposed to christianity seemed to hate christianity i mean the persecution was certainly really thick in the first second even third century the fourth century though when Constantine legalizes christianity in the early part of the fourth century and the theodosius in the latter part of the fourth century makes christianity the official approved religion of the empire that doesn't seem like all the nations are hating there so i don't know it looks like that would align with a lot of moments in history but maybe not every moment in history let's keep going at that time many will turn away from faith and we'll betray and hate each other i mean every century has that many false prophets will appear i mean that's happening in the first century we've got stuff about that still recorded to come yet in the new testament uh the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold i paul seems to be writing about that kind of stuff in romans but he stands firm to the end will be saved that smacks of a whole bunch of other bible language as well in the new testament i don't know my point is it's pretty hard to pin this on like one exact place and make the argument like oh yeah all of that happened and therefore the end of time as jesus conceived of the end of time that happened a long long time ago that that all took care of itself in the first century and i think that gives weight to those scholars who argue that in this second chunk of the olivet discourse even though it's targeted at the experience of the disciples it's still descriptive of a reality that's going to be recurring for a very long time then you're not going to have clarity on what is light our darkest hour until after the fact in further support of that read that this is sort of an ongoing description of things that won't just happen to this round of disciples who are sitting there with him but that will happen to future disciples we got to remember that according to john 17 at this time in jesus life he had future believers in mind in john 17 right after these events he goes and prays and in that prayer the last thing he prays to his father is for people who will believe through the testimony of the disciples who are physically following jesus around right then so jesus anticipates a future church he anticipates this thing going on for a while and if there's any debate about that we look at these last couple of verses of what he says in this chunk and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come. Matthew 10 you'll recall the missional discourse suggests that the disciples are going to go out with this message the message that the kingdom is at hand the same message jesus is referencing right here in Matthew 24 and that they're going to do that for a long time and they're going to suffer a pretty difficult fate and all kinds of persecution for it so like we talked about yesterday this does feel like a double down on Matthew 10 but it also feels like an anticipation a look forward to what jesus says in the thesis verse of the book of acts in acts one eight the disciples have all gathered around jesus he's back to life and he's fixing to go to the right hand of the father and leave them there to figure it out and finally they can't help it anymore and they're like oh but like before you go we're gonna have a reckoning right like now we were gonna restore israel and be vindicated like it kind of feels like it's the last minute so we're gonna do that right and they should have known better because jesus told him in chapter 10 of Matthew jesus told him here in chapter 24 of Matthew that now the message of the kingdom is going to go to everybody first and that's your job and specifically he says that in acts one seven and eight he said to them it is not for you to know the times or dates the father has set by his own authority but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses in jirousalim and then the larger area judiya and a neighboring regional area samaria and to the ends of the earth and then he says that and then he ascends into heaven it seems once again crystal clear that jesus first chunk of answer to the question the disciples asked which is tell us when will this happen what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age his first chunk of answer is all this stuff's just gonna keep happening like just this is just how the world is get used to it you don't need to be alarmed when you see the normal unfoldings of the world even though those normal unfoldings can be pretty cataclysmic and ugly and scary then i think in the second chunk here he is speaking directly to his immediate followers and reminding them like remember i told you that this was gonna get tough and it is going to get tough and you're going to be discouraged because the church is going to flail at times it's gonna seem like the outside world is really tough on christianity and it's gonna seem like christianity can't get out of its own way and is really tough on christianity and even though this might seem like light our darkest hour this has got to be the darkest hour it's still not this is just a thing that they are going to have to go through but that the timeline is more oriented according to jesus based on his followers and the descendants of those followers spiritually going out and pronouncing that message that john the baptist said in the very beginning matthew chapter three and that jesus repeated right after that which is repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand what percentage of planet earth has to hear in order to trigger jesus initiating the end of all things i don't know i'm not sure it really works that way or can be calculated that way i mean we did just look at ax chapter one where jesus starts his remarks in verse seven saying that's not for you to know the times of the dates my father is set by his own authority so jesus seems to be pretty clearly intent on giving his disciples enough not to freak out to stay steady and steadfast and targeted and enough for them to brace themselves for the difficult things that are coming for them and in a larger sense of planet earth but the whole work here involves articulating the glory of god and the message of his kingdom to a whole lot of people and at least at this point matthew chapter 24 and at least in ax chapter one there's just a whole lot of history to unfold and a whole lot of people who need to hear that stuff and that is the job of people who are ambassadors son's daughters heirs of the kingdom and we'll roll into the next chunk of his answer next time around i'm matt this is the 10 minute bible hour podcast let's do this again soon the phone…
