 Advent episode and Advent episode The 10 minute Bible hour podcast It's an Advent episode and Advent episode Of the 10 minute Bible hour My guest I got an idea and I guess I already kind of gave it away with the music that Jeff just did I want to do a few bonus Saturday Advent episodes this year And I know at any given time that the majority of you who are listening or somewhere in the back catalog catching up and that only a large minority of you are actually Current as I'm recording this but as I record this it is early in the Advent season and by Advent I mean that time of year that is building in anticipation toward Christmas Day where we celebrate God taking on flesh the gigantic climactic event in God's whole redemptive plan It's the moment where God goes from a character who dwells in a temple and even though he's everywhere and he's present And he seems to be affecting history and guiding history It still feels like there's this distance between Humanities finite nature and the infinite nature of God and it feels throughout the Old Testament Like there's just only so close you can get Just shouldn't work at all for there to be any kind of even logically feasible Union or closeness between the finite and the infinite if you really think about that and tease that out more than we're gonna Do right now see what I'm talking about that that shouldn't even work How could those two parties even interact when one party knows everything that has been and will be and might have been like How do you have a conversation? What do you do? Or where does that relationship go? And so the whole Old Testament doesn't just beg for some kind of completion to the religious elements about sacrifice sin and redemption and all of that kind of stuff the Old Testament adds as well as Reason and the human experience in general Bags for some kind of mediator some kind of go-between that could somehow facilitate a union between the finite and the infinite Which on paper seems like it should be rationally impossible So we have this heart level need for a go-between We have this philosophical logical level need for a go-between and all of the Old Testament I going back to the very first stuff that you and I talked about on this podcast 500 and whatever episodes ago all of the Old Testament is like this lobbed softball through history It's this setup. It's like there's a thing coming And it just kills you that you're damn finished. It's like finish the song do the last two notes feel so incomplete It's meant to feel that way. It's meant to resonate with the human experience and be like you know how life feels like there's more to this thing like there's more to you. There's more to our essence. There's more to relationships and living and dying and Dreaming and hurting and glory. There is more to this whole thing It feels like Then what anybody seems fully able to account for and we suspect that that completion is in the infinite is in the divine But how would you access that because we're so not divine and so finite in the whole Old Testament? I think is resonated with so many different people from so many different cultures is so many different times even across languages Because it is so representative of what we understand about government and politics and the shortcomings of all of that and the ugliness of war and death and tragedy And that human yearning for this thing that seems just beyond our grasp And with all of this setup and all of this longing that we get in the Old Testament eventually the payoff is God shows up in the flesh and shows up in such a way that now all of a sudden whoa That's an avenue for union between the finite and the divine that is an avenue that could allow Normal people like you and me and everybody else throughout history who feels this longing and this yearning and this sense of Transcendence but inability to grasp it. It's a pathway for that to be Grasped and laid hold of and so the reason I want to talk about Advent and I guess like I said Oh, we're gonna talk about Advent and then I immediately started talking about Advent before I was even done explaining why But going back to that the opening thought the reason I want to do this Advent thing and look at some verses and think about it together Is because I want us to share together in the anticipation of something that at least holds itself out as Addressing that grand yearning of all of humanity part of the beauty of Advent for the person who is sizing it up for the person Who is just curious from the perspective of others from the person who's? Really wrestling with things right now or for the person who's been around this for a long time It's this built-in rhythm to our year and we only get so many of those years to do this We're together as pilgrims on a journey trying to figure things out and connect with that thing that is the truest realist thing We had to anticipate the culmination of a process of thought that is much grander than just oh, where are you gonna go to church? That is much grander than what do you think about that hot button? theological issue the questions here are so much bigger and Historically the Christian biblical understanding is that this is the time of year where the big questions the gigantic Deep-down existential essence level heart level questions that transcend our age and our relationships and our moment in history that are endemic to what it is to be a human being this thing that we anticipate with Advent holds itself out as Addressing those questions in a way that is true and meaningful and eternal in the spirit of talking about Anticipation here's a passage you and I have looked at before from Isaiah chapter 9 This one comes up all over the place in the book of Matthew. I think it gets referenced in chapter 11 I think it's gonna come up later on in Matthew like in the very last chapter It comes up right at the end of the prologue in Matthew before the sermon on the mount toward the end of Matthew chapter 4 You're gonna recognize this one. It's really Christmas Eve is from Isaiah chapter 9 verse 1 But there will be no gloom for her who is in anguish in the former time He brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of naphtally But in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea the land beyond Jordan Galilee of the nations It's okay if you don't remember off the top of your head all of the historical context the Bible context about that stuff It's setting those tensions and those frictions that the original audience would have known up as a contrast to this coming redemption this bridging of the gap this thing where God arrives and sets straight things that have been Lost and hopeless and that pivot happens right here in verse 2 the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light Those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness on them a light is shown you've multiplied the nation you've increased its joy They rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest as they are glad when they divide the spoil for the yoke of his burden and the staff for his shoulder The rod of his oppressor you have broken as on the day of Midian for every boot of the trampling warrior and battle Tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire So all of this is saying that the mess is over there will be a reckoning There will be a redemption a setting straight of all of the things that cause hurt and anguish and darkness and that feeling of Separation from the transcendent and what is true and real in the truest real is sense even though implements of war are going to be Resolved into some other form no longer used as instruments of destruction or reminders of the human pain And here's why verse 6 if you missed everything else get this part For unto us a child is born to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty God everlasting father Prince of peace of the increase of his government and of peace There'll be no end on the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish it and uphold it with justice and with righteousness From this time forth and forevermore the zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this This passage is all about anticipation this passage all in one acknowledges the stuff that hurts acknowledges all the stuff just insert whatever it is that Breaks your heart that makes you feel defeated that takes the wind and the energy out of it whatever perspective you're coming from in life You have something like that the people this was written to in the first place they could totally relate and everybody before and everybody Sense can totally relate there's an acknowledgement of what that darkness is like but then there's this cathartic language about all the things that Are exemplary of that brokenness? It's all gonna be repurposed. It's all gonna be fixed resolved Tossed aside because those instruments of destruction whatever they might be in your given context will no longer be necessary Because right government is coming and by this I don't mean like oh the political party I like is finally gonna win and they're gonna straighten things out It doesn't mean that at all what this is talking about is the ultimate and right and final true just good merciful benevolent changing authority of God being made fully visible to humanity and all of those values of the kingdom that you and I have looked at Gradually at this point over 23 chapters of the book of Matthew those values that currency all of those things Replacing all of those lesser values that may be in the moment We like but as we game it out over a lifetime we realize this just does not get it done all the things that cause brokenness will ultimately be shattered and broken and Replaced as this one who we are to anticipate shows up and Illustrates and inaugurates this kingdom with the values that every one of us at the deepest part of our soul is yearning for Whether we've figured out how to put words to that yet or not and then I love the way this passage wraps up saying that it is not the hard work of Political action committees or your party or this propaganda machine that is gonna get that done It's the zeal of the Lord of hosts who will accomplish this what that means is the pressure is off of us to fix all of the things We don't have to feel overwhelmed by those things as we operate during this advent season in anticipation of celebrating the incarnation of Christ at Christmas instead. There's this deferral this Exhausted warrior who is duked it out and can barely lift his sword anymore And now the invincible warrior has waited into the situation and all you can do in exhaustion is raise your sword to acknowledge that the king Has showed up and that the king by his efforts by his power by his authority will not only inaugurate these things But will sustain these things and he will not ugly or dirty himself in the process of doing it like you and I would have to do Anytime we would want to grab power even for good reasons. He doesn't have to do that. He knows what to do with power He's the author of power the initiator of power the one who strips people of power the rest of us have to stoop and become something That makes us unfit to lead when we grab power, but this king is unaffected by power He is power incarnate He knows what to do with it and it is by his authority that he will accomplish all of these beautiful Redemptive things that is the prophetic promise of Isaiah that is paid off in the book of Matthew And it is paid off in the lives of people who internalize this story and through this story and the work of the main character of this story Are able to finally lay hold of a prehend put touch and reality to that? Deepest yearning of the human soul for union with the infinite wherever you are right now Whatever you think about stuff wherever we ultimately all end up landing on these things Thank you for right now in this moment at this time wherever you're sitting Well, whatever you're listening to this on. Thank you for Anticipating with me. I appreciate you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon You
