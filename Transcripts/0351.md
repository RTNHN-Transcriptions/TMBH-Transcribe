 Hello, my name is Matt Whitman. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast, and I have an observation about people who wrote cartoons in the 1980s. I think these people had an unhealthy obsession with mind control, and I hesitate to speculate exactly what prompted that unhealthy obsession, but it was in every single kids series. I ever watched everybody had an episode as a cartoon hero where the bad guy would find like a bracelet of power, a ring of mind control, or they'd invent some headband that they could put on the good guy's head, and then the good guy would have electricity go through him, and he'd shake and his fingers would crinkle all up, and then like a little thing would happen in his eyes, and that would tell you he's bad now. And then the good guys would go and do bad things, and you'd be like, what? No! That's not how you are. What are you doing? I hated those episodes because it just felt so wrong and dirty and out of character. I remember reading the passage. We're going to be looking at today for the first time, which is Matthew 1520-something through 20-something else. I don't know. I'll look it up in just a second. And when I encountered this passage for the first time, I remember being very troubled by it as a kid. Now, cool side note here. This Bible that I can reach it went and got for this conversation is my super old growing up Bible. This one was given to me by my dad on October 22, 1982. I can tell because of this super awful kid handwriting that I have in here. And then somewhere along the way in childhood, somebody told me that a thing I should do is as I'm reading through the Bible for the first time ever, I should just take a pen and write on the pages of the Bible whatever date I encountered a passage for the first time. And then I would always be able to go back and it'd be like a time machine. And someday you'll be able to reestablish what was going on in the world and what you were thinking about at that time in life. And it'll help you remember some of the ideas that you formulated about this passage based on where your brain was at when that happened. I don't remember that's exactly how they said it, but that's how I took it and internalized it. And so I did it. And it's got dates all over it. And here's one from what does that even say? 1993. Apparently I read Luke in 1993 and I had horrific handwriting. And apparently I read through Matthew beginning to end once in 1990 and then again in the spring of 1996. So the first time I ever encountered this, I was, you know, a kid like just getting to the back end of when watching cartoons is an okay thing that you'd want to do. You know, maybe a little less cartoons, a little more girls at this point in my life. But I remember reading this and feeling that same kind of cartoon watching emotion of like, whoa, Jesus, why are you talking to this lady that way? Is there some, the Pharisees invent like a mind control bracelet and they're controlling your brain? To fight it, Jesus, fight it. I mean, I don't think I was that dumb, but it troubled me because what I'm about to read to you seemed really out of character for him. And I was confusing for me. This is the passage we're talking about. Matthew 15 starting in verse 21, we worked on some of the geography and narrative stuff about this yesterday, but now we're into Jesus exchange with his lady. So it goes like this, leaving that place Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. So way up north from where he normally hangs out, non-Jewish, that is Gentile territory. And it says, a Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him crying out, Lord, son of David, have mercy on me. My daughter is suffering terribly from demon possession. Jesus didn't answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, send her away. She keeps crying out after us. And he answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel. And then the woman came and knelt before him and said, Lord, help me. He replied, it's not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs. Yes, Lord, she said, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table, then Jesus answered, woman, you have great faith. Your request is granted and her daughter was healed from that very hour. Okay, look, I know that there are some of you here who've been through the Bible 10 billion times. You know this thing inside and outside way, way better than I do. I know there are others of you. This is your first trip through a book of the Bible like this, or your first trip through the Book of Matthew. And maybe you're having a similar reaction as I did on January 1st of 1990 when I read this for the first time. And it does seem out of character and weird to you. I would say whether you are a cagey old Bible veteran or this is new, though, it is a reasonable question to look at this passage and instead of just being like, oh, I'm sure whatever you were doing there and however you were playing this was just great and right. And instead to go ahead and just ask, why do you sound like this? Why the departure from the normal tone? I mean, we get all these passages that you and I have looked at before where Jesus looks at the crowds and he has compassion on them because they're harried and helpless like sheep without a shepherd. He's frustrated with John the Baptist disciples and the people who are sitting around gawking and happy that Jesus was frustrated with them. And then after lecturing them, he turns around and says to them that, you know, they should come to him if they're weary and burdened because his burden is easy, his yoke is light. I think I got that backwards. And then Jesus tries to get away after his cousin gets stinking beheaded. I mean, come on, give the guy some space, but the crowds catch up with him anyway and he has compassion on them. So we see all this stuff about Jesus having this insufferably soft heart, like 80s cartoon superhero, always right, always good level soft heart. And then you get this and it sounds, I don't know, by today's standards, almost a little bit racist and certainly off putting and not merciful. And I think it's okay to just feel like what the heck is going on here. So let's see the thing where we try and really honestly break it down, reserving judgment, and then we'll consider what the possible explanations are at the end for what's actually going on here. And now this is going to be one of those two day conversations. So we'll get as far as we get and then we'll just flip over to the next thing. All right. So Jesus is out of the pocket. He's in a place where theoretically nobody should recognize him. There's no reason to imagine that his reputation would have leaked outside of Jewish territory given the accounts that we have at least so far in the book of Matthew. I mean, if we saw at the end of chapter 14 that it took a little bit of doing for a couple of people to recognize Jesus and connect the dots in Genesis, just a couple miles down the road from Capernaum, his base of operations, then we would expect that way up north, we're talking days and days and days journey up north. You'd expect nobody to connect those dots. But of all the things, a Canaanite woman does so that this is a Canaanite woman, I think is very significant in terms of a clue for how we're supposed to read this text. Okay. So Canaanite, first of all, that's the ancient enemy of the Israelite people. They were the people who were the giants in the land that most of the Hebrew spies thought they could not defeat. But Joshua and Caleb way back at the end of Moses life, they infiltrated the land and they're like, yeah, God said we could conquer this land and set up shop here and we should go do it. And so that campaign that is largely described in the book of Joshua and that is a very challenging campaign to think through and wrestle with starts with the battle of Jericho. And then there's this whole series of battles of conquest all around the Holy Land that results in Israel getting politically established where it gets politically established. Now, there were a few pockets here and there at the end of the book of Joshua that we find out were not conquered in the book of Joshua. That is not held out as a positive thing. The idea was that they were supposed to conquer all of it and either completely defeat those other people groups or in one way or another assimilate them under the authority of the God who they worship. Now in Matthew 15, here we are, 1300 years later and there's still a Canaanite presence. Okay, well, that's great. She's here now. Jesus doesn't seem interested in making any kind of broad sweeping political statement about that. The fact that this is one, a Canaanite, an ancient enemy of the Jewish people and as dark and difficult to process as this is, she is also a living reminder of her ancestors' failure to completely conquer this land. Someday we'll take the time to process that out more deeply. Further, it's a woman and the cultural expectation for a rabbi at this time would be that you would avoid this person on both of those grounds. It's not just a Gentile. It's a Canaanite Gentile and further, that's a woman. There's no upside to this interaction occurring. So as Canaanite woman comes out from the vicinity and she's crying out, Lord, son of David have mercy on me. Wait, what? Record scratch? Excuse me? She identifies him as the son of David and it's a positive. Well, shouldn't she be embittered and angry about this 1300 year old conquest and the tremendous slight that her people endured? I don't know. Maybe she should be. I mean, there's a lot of slights throughout history that everybody would have to work hard to keep track of and probably everybody would have to go around with a chip on their shoulder if we were going to sort that stuff out completely. And maybe that's what we ought to do. Maybe there should be more chips on shoulders. But whatever the case, it doesn't seem that there's anything there. In fact, it seems like it's the exact opposite that son of David here isn't meant to be first and foremost understood as some kind of political acknowledgement of the Jewish conquest that had occurred in their political sovereignty. Now, son of David is a messianic term. And we see it that way from the very beginning in the book of Matthew. I mean, isn't like the first verse of Matthew? I'm going to look down if it's not. Matthew 1-1, a record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. So there's Matthew's thesis that Jesus is the son of David and that means more than just a political claim. That's developed thoroughly in the first four chapters of the gospel. And then on through any time we see somebody use the title son of David, it means they get it. It means they see Jesus for who he is before it was cool to see him that way. So how wild is it that this outsider in every way sees Jesus in a place that he shouldn't be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, as Jesus of Nazareth, right? I don't know how she recognized him in the first place. But even if she did, how wild is it that she would care and care in a positive way, but recognize she does and care she does and further, she's not hesitating. Implicit in her identification of him as the son of David is her saying, you are the one who is supposed to reign on the eternal throne of David. I know exactly who you are. And if there's any confusion over whether or not she really meant that by those remarks, well, would you ask the following of someone who you just thought was some sort of political air to settle a political dispute? Because she chases that by saying, my daughter is suffering terribly from demon possession. In other words, she believes that somehow being the promised son of David comes with the ability to resolve supernatural affliction. And her request is not unprecedented because again, I'm just I'm all over flipping pages. In Matthew chapter eight, the second thing that happens when Jesus comes off of the sermon on the Mount is that he gets approached by that centurion who's like, Hey, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and is in terrible suffering. This is very, very similar. So as we get said to hit pause for the day here, we have to acknowledge that at least once this exact formula for a thing went down and we know how Jesus responded. He resolved the situation with a non Jewish person making almost an identical request that would require almost identical power, power over distance and power over affliction. And in that case, it looked like physical affliction. In this case, it looks like supernatural demonic affliction. And tomorrow we'll try to get to the bottom of why he wasn't perkier and more eager to help and why it seems like he's almost being out and out mean and grouchy to this lady. Pausing there, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast more this manana.
