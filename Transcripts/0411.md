 Did you ever watch that Pacific Rim movie came out 10-ish years ago's Guillermo del Toro show? I'm pretty sure he's the same guy who did the Shape of Water, which didn't do much for me, and Pan's Labyrinth, which did a lot for me. I thought that was a great show. Whether you like this guy's movies or not, you got to admit the premise is always pretty stinking and interesting. And Pacific Rim is no exception. There's this scenario where a bunch of monsters get teleported through some kind of portal in the deep ocean and they do what monsters do, which is want to eat coastal cities. And then the humans have to come up with a way to fight back. And this is where I think the genius of it comes in. In del Toro's Pacific Rim universe, the humans counter this threat by making big giant robots that are big enough to go hand-to-hand toe-to-toe with the monsters that want to eat the cities. But the robots are so big and require so much data processing that it takes two people to come together. They have to overcome their differences. They have to overcome their individual aspirations and they have to agree that the most important pressing thing is that they slay this monster, that they deal with this really difficult threat, this problem in front of them. And in doing all of that, they get in sync. I mean, that isn't the term they use in the movie, I don't think. They do this like brain-length thing where together they can pilot this gigantic anti-monster robot. And so as they sync up and they do all these moves, then what they do on this little stage gets played out on this gigantic stage with the robot that they're in and that they're piloting. And of course, the beauty of the movie is not so much about defeating the monsters without. It's about defeating the monsters amongst us and getting to a place where we do set aside our differences to accomplish this greater, more important thing. And likewise, we get a scenario in Matthew chapter 18, verse 18, coming off of the very famous three-fold set of instructions that Jesus gives for how to deal with sin or get in sideways relationally with people in church. We get done with all of that stuff. You get all of that business in verses 15 through 17. And then in verse 18, we get this very familiar concept. It says, I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loose to heaven. And I think of those giant robots, I think they called them Yegers in Pacific Rim. I think those Yegers, those giant robots and what has to happen for those to work once again is two people have to come together and agree on what the bigger, more powerful thing needs to be doing. And then somehow there is a union between these two things. Now some of you are like, Oh, wow, this analogy is going to lead us straight into heresy. And my response to that would be, yes, maybe my analogy is not perfect here, but this is a difficult truth to understand in the Bible because it looks like what Jesus is saying to his disciples as he's trying to explain to them how to make the life of this new family of faith function. He's saying that there is some kind of union between people who are doing what he wants and are gathered together in his name to represent the values of his kingdom within the church. There's some kind of union between those people are trying to get it right and like something much, much, much bigger and more powerful. In this case, bigger and more powerful than a monster smashing robot, that being the God of the whole universe on the most basic level. This isn't actually that hard. Jesus has just given very difficult instructions about things that people who are in this new family of faith might have to do from time to time when stuff gets weird stuff gets sideways. People do destructive stuff. They dig in they get stubborn. Like, some of you are going to have to confront this and you're going to have to represent the king and the values of the kingdom. And it's going to be hard and maybe not everybody will even be on board with it. God is going to be with you. And that's why you get the language coming up in a couple of verses in verse 20 about if two or three come together in my name, there I am with them. So simple level. This is a hard thing, but God is with you and he's working through his church. But the more complex question is, how does that actually work? And how much authority does the church have to dictate to God? What's going on in heaven? Now, you no doubt noticed that verse 18 of Matthew 18, the stuff about binding and loosing sounds a lot like Matthew 16, where Peter gives his confession of Jesus as the Christ. And then Jesus turns around and says a bunch of really nice things to Peter. He says, blessed are you Simon, son of Jonah, for this, that being his confession that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my father in heaven. And I tell you that you're Peter and on this rock, I'll build my church and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. Cool. Awesome stuff. And here we go. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. And whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. That's pretty much verbatim what he says again two chapters later in the passage we're looking at today. The only difference between the two that really jumps out to me is in chapter 16, Jesus is clearly talking to Peter with an earshot of the rest of the team. And in chapter 18, Jesus doesn't specify that he's talking to Peter at all. It would seem that he's talking to anyone who might be a representative of the kingdom, who finds himself in a position where they need to go through these three steps to resolve a sin or a problem in church. And so it looks like over the course of these two chapters, it looks to me like Jesus is expanding this authority to make it really clear that this binding and loosing thing, this is not limited to Peter alone specifically, but that this is something that the entire church is to do. Now look elephant in the room, the Orthodox church and the Catholic church. Look at these passages would say, hey, these are really important for our understanding of how the church works and for our understanding of the authority of the church and our understanding of how that authority even reaches into heaven and that God has our back when we excommunicate or when we offer absolution to someone who needs forgiveness. Biblical, historical, creedal Christians outside of Eastern Orthodoxy and Catholicism would tend to look at those passages and say, if we just had chapter 16, it might be a little bit ambiguous, but the same phrase being reissued in chapter 18 indicates that this is Christ's church. The Holy Spirit is guiding the church that this goes far beyond the leadership or the leadership family tree of one guy and look, this is just no way we're going to work that through in a 10-minute podcast. This is one of the profound disagreements that have existed between the Catholic church and everyone who isn't the Catholic church, Orthodox Protestants, everybody, and this is probably one of those passages that should humble us a little bit and cause us to say, well, there are a few things in the Bible that our presuppositions are going to inform how we read the text a little bit and just accept that we're going to bring some biases with us. Still, at the most simple level, I think Catholics, Orthodox Protestants would all agree that there is some kind of Jaeger-Pacific Rim relationship here between the church and God. That's trippy if we're reading this passage, right? But what a great privilege, what a great investiture of trust. This passage indicates God is putting in his church that somehow God is going to use living imperfect people in an imperfect institution to wade through these difficult situations and these difficult questions. And somehow, and I think this is a bit of a mystery, there is a union between these two or three who are gathered together and moving the mechanisms and moving in sync and the much greater higher power that is God and that somehow this union, this cooperation between the two never undermines the sovereignty of God, the decision-making of God, the role of judgment and justice that belongs entirely to God. But the passage indicates that somehow the church is participating in this difficult thing that is wholly owned by God. By definition, God is all powerful and all knowing and can be dictated to by no one. So I can't read this passage as him handing off authority and be like, well, you guys tell me how it is. And then I'll just have to do that further. There are obvious limits to this binding and loosing thing. I mean, two or three of us can gather together and try to control the Jaeger that is God and be like, I wanted to reign Coca-Cola classic ice cold directly into this glass for all of the world to drink at once. It is self-evident from nature and Bible that just because two people agree on something and then tell God how it is, it doesn't mean that he's going to do it. So clearly, God is not forfeited any of his actual binding authority with this. But this union between the very finite and very small and the very big and the very powerful is on display here in Matthew 18 as it was earlier in Matthew 16. And I think this passage gives us a little bit more clarity on what that union looks like. But to really get it, we'll have to get into the next part of the passage, which is tomorrow. This Saturday, I'm doing a special bonus episode of the podcast with my friend and editor and musician, Jeff Foote. We're going to work through the best answers that we saw to the Jeff Foote musical Easter egg challenge that we just wrapped up here a few weeks ago. We got a ton of submissions from you with your guesses as to what Jeff's musical Easter eggs at the end of the first 400 episodes of the podcast might have meant. It's been really fun reading through those. We'll do a special episode on Saturday where we announce the winner. We have some fun and some surprises in store for all of that. So I hope you make a little bit of extra time to hang out with me this week. And even if you can't make it for the Saturday thing, we'll just keep rolling with Matthew as we get through this week and into next Monday as well. If you were still planning to submit a list of guesses as to what those Easter eggs mean, you've got a couple of days to do that. But by the middle of this week, I will have had to have made all of those decisions. So if you've been holding out, make sure to get that in right away. You can submit that or anything you want to at thetmbh at gmail.com. I hope things are going awesomely for you. And I look forward to hanging out again tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
