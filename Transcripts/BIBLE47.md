 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about second Corinthians. It looks like the Apostle Paul wrote at least four letters to the church in Corinth. Two of those we still have, and both of the letters that we have between Paul and the church in Corinth, are in the New Testament. So in 2 Corinthians, Paul is following up on stuff that he wrote to the very troubled church in Corinth in 1 Corinthians. And the positive note here, as we turn the page from 1 Corinthians to 2 Corinthians, is it looked like it kind of worked. It looks like things are getting better in Corinth, but they're not out of the woods. This is clearly a very difficult church. And at first glance, from a couple thousand years away, it might be easy to be like, well, these people were just clearly inferior. They just weren't very good at being Christians. But if you look a little more closely at the background of Corinth, like you and I tried to do in our last conversation on 1 Corinthians, I think you feel a little more empathetic. Now, look, last time around, we talked about the reality that there's an almost millennium-old sex cult to the goddess Aphrodite that had always been associated with Corinth. I mean, it's their patron goddess is the goddess associated with sex and licentiousness. That's going to leave a mark on the culture. But something we didn't talk about last time was the political instability of Corinth. Corinth as a proud history, by the time we encounter it in the first century, it's one of the great ancient Greek cities. Whenever you see that fuzzy, topped Mohawk helmet in any kind of depiction of Greek warfare, that's called a Corinthian helmet. They were proud allies of the Spartans. They also fought against the Spartans. All the Greeks fought against each other at some point or another. But then in the middle of the second century BC, as the Roman Republic is really getting into that expansion mode, there are problems in Greece and a couple of prominent Roman leaders get dispatched to go and finally get Greece under control. In the midst of that campaign, Corinth gets caught up and it gets wiped out by the Romans, who were in the habit of doing that to trouble some cities from time to time, see Carthage in North Africa. Well, Corinth just goes dormant for a hundred years. And coincidentally, that hundred years that Corinth is more or less gone corresponds pretty closely to the hundred years that the Jews had their independent Maccabean kingdom before the Romans came and shut that down. Well, about the same time that the Romans come and shut down the Maccabean kingdom, they also go and start back up resuscitate, revive the city of Corinth. But not as a Greek city, it's a straight up Roman colony. Like they took Roman citizens and Roman government and they dropped it right over the top of the ruins of ancient Corinth. So this is a town then that is emblematic of the vigorous shaking up of the ant farm and the new pathways that cut as a result of the ancient Mediterranean world under the influence of the storm of the earthquake of the tsunami that is Rome. When we understand Corinth in this way, we understand how crazy it must have looked to everybody in early Christianity to try to go and start a church there, let alone persist, as soon as things predictably went off the rails, Corinth lacked identity, Corinth lacked integrity, Corinth lacked roots, it lacked grounding. Fair or not, it was a town that was a metaphor for chasing after whatever is recent and expedient. It just doesn't seem like that's a place where you want to go. If you want to have a church that is going to work out great, yet the New Testament holds out God as ordaining and Paul as enthusiastically going right to the heart of the mess and being like, we're putting a church right here. Now, why? Well, the most basic level, of course, because you want to see the most lost, reached with the message, the words of life of Jesus. So there's that. But additionally, I think first and second Corinthians are in the Bible to give us an example of what it looks like to persist in faith and the worship of God and doing redemptive things even when your church isn't going perfectly. There's kind of a timeless message for the ages for all churches everywhere that I think is meant to serve as an encouragement to say, your church will never be perfect. Your church will always be influenced by culture. You will have fights in church. Things will go sideways. And here are prescriptions for how to make it right and how to orient yourself to pull through those difficult times, but don't think that those difficult times just bastardize and ruin everything. God is still doing redemptive things through his church, even as the best of churches get weird and go sideways from time to time. So the timeline with Corinth is really interesting as it pertains to second Corinthians. The church was probably founded around 50 AD, the details of that are recorded in Acts 18. And then Paul writes a letter having heard about trouble in Corinth after he'd spent a bunch of time there and moved on to do other work. We don't have the text of that first actual letter we're aware of to the Corinthians. So I'm going to call that Corinthians A. That's the A letter. And it looks like that was a difficult letter meant to begin to address problems. Then we get the B letter to the Corinthians, which we call first Corinthians. This was probably written around 57 AD. And as you recall from the conversation yesterday, it was confrontational. And it pushed this church to get their stuff together, work out the things that were going wrong and reorient to the gospel. Shortly after that, we get Corinthians C, which is lost to us. We don't know really much of anything about what's in there. But we know this letter exists because Paul references it in second Corinthians as being a letter that was handed off by one of Paul's associates, Titus. And he refers to this letter as being a sharp letter. In other words, this was not an easy thing for them to hear. And Paul was confronting an ongoing church crisis. Now this church crisis looks like the whole thing unfolded over the course of about a year in 57 AD. So we have Corinthian letter A, Corinthian letter B, which is known as first Corinthians, Corinthian letter C, which is that sharp letter that Titus delivered. We don't know anything else about what was in there. And then we get to Corinthian letter D, and that is second Corinthians. And of the four, I think second Corinthians is the most optimistic because apparently Paul has got some kind of report back to him that says, hey, there was repentance. If anything, maybe over repentance and the church discipline and correction that had been carried out against the most grievous offenders within the church is maybe like Paul is saying, like, hey, that's plenty actually. We're good. Maybe you can start to restore that person with gentleness now. In the first part of the letter, chapters one through seven, Paul is like, hey, great. We're making progress. I'm encouraged to hear about all of this. And underscoring all of that first section seems to be some kind of assumption that maybe all the hardships Paul has suffered in going around and planting all of these churches on these missionary journeys is somehow to the Greek mind reflective of how the mischievous gods would punish and obstruct the old Greek heroes on their Odysseys and journeys because there was something wrong with those old heroes. And so they were inflicting a Greek understanding of these very humanized, petty gods and the great heroes of your from Greek legend. They were mistakenly inflicting that on the God of all things and imagining Paul in a Homeric sense, imagining Paul like Odysseys or something. But Paul is saying, no, it's all different here. And he points to the example of Christ and the suffering of Christ. And then Paul gestures to his own suffering. And in so many words, he's saying, I'm following the template. I'm following the example of Christ. This suffering is a badge of honor, not a mark of the punishment of God. And so it's crazy chronologically, the oldest book of the Bible might be Job. And here we are seeing one side of the conversation between Paul and a church, maybe 2000 years even after Job was written and it's people grappling with the same questions. But chapters one through seven are super positive, even celebratory. In chapters eight through nine, Paul points out the consequences of getting derailed the way they got derailed. All the other churches have put together money to prop up an impoverished church who's gone through a difficult time because of famine and other problems in Jerusalem. And so Paul's been going around gathering this offering to take back to help out the Jerusalem Christians. And Corinth hasn't really done much to contribute to that because they've been too busy cannibalizing each other and fighting. And Paul reminds them, hey, generosity is one of the things that is one of the most natural outflows of the values of the kingdom and the Christian life. And this is a place where your generosity is needed and that's something that you got to get right. Then the third section, chapters 10 through 13, Paul addresses this lingering problem that was the very first problem addressed in the previous letter of 1 Corinthians. And that is this contestation about which Christian celebrity everybody should follow. Now you go and read Paul and you see the flow of his thought and the passion of his arguments in writing and it's very impressive. But apparently Paul was not as great in person and there had been all of these other more impressive Christian teachers and celebrities who'd been showing up with letters of recommendation and needing pretty serious compensation to pay for their level of excellence. And apparently they outshined Paul in terms of personal presentation and public speaking and they never got shipped, wrecked or beaten or anything. And so a lot of these Corinthian churchgoers were like, I kind of like these other fancy new apostles who are coming down the pike. And look, even Paul's good buddy Luke at one point in the book of Acts acknowledges that Paul could kind of go on and on a little bit and it could get a little bit dry. And that comes to us in the form of Luke sharing an anecdote in the book of Acts where Paul talks way, way into the night and somebody gets so tired and bored that they pass out and fall out of a window and die and then get resuscitated and brought back to life. Some of the wildest stories in the New Testament. So Paul doesn't try to make the case that he really is the most gifted eloquent speaker in everybody should like his style the most. Rather, he points out that this dispute is dumb. And also he points to his resume. Maybe at first glance it looks like he's trying to defend himself. But when you look a little bit closer, it would appear that the reason Paul is pointing to his resume is to say like, hey, you got the gospel, the message of Jesus in the kingdom from me. And this is why the message you have is reliable. Don't deviate from it when these expensive fancy tell you what you want to hear super apostles show up and try to curry favor with you. So we wrap up the second canonical New Testament letter to the Corinthians on a pretty positive note with Paul checking his rivals with a sense that repentance has occurred. Maybe we're ready to put this crisis in the church of Corinth behind us. But also with a sense that there are still some lingering challenges and questions. And the reader of this letter is invited to celebrate the good stuff while also acknowledging this ain't perfect quite yet with them as they move on into the rest of the New Testament. So Corinth is a troubled church. It's a mixed bag. Good things happened. Weird things happened. If you've ever been a part of anything, a job, a volunteer institution, a church, a sports team, a board with you're trying to serve those kids, whatever it is, I promise you, there has been something you've experienced that makes you feel gross and icky inside where it's like, Oh, our disagreement and our politicking and our infighting feels like it just undoes all of the good that we're trying to accomplish with this good idea. But then hopefully you're able to step back from that and wash a little bit of the ick off and be like, Nope, this is the cost to do in business when you get together with other flawed people and you mix together all of our insecurities and selfish ambition and selflessness. Just weird stuff is going to happen sometimes. Hopefully you're able to look at all of the redemptive things that come out of that and see it is still a valuable endeavor even when it does get sideways. Likewise with the church, for me, one of the biggest takeaways is somebody who's worked in a church for a long time and who's felt a lot of the weirdness of church is that there is a redemptive through line even in the broken church because of the goodness of God, the presence of His Holy Spirit, the power and effectiveness of the gospel, even when things go through a difficult season and things feel very ick. The theology that that ick prompts Paul to put on display in these two letters about the nature of Christ and the Christian life and the work of the Holy Spirit, undefeatability of the church and the redemptive plan is in and of itself demonstrative of the point that God does good things even through our flawed collective efforts. When you visualize Corinthians picture people fixing a damaged church, when you think about the theme reflect on God's work in and through difficult times in church. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go read all of chapter four and the very famous chapter five verse 17 because that big pictures at all. It lifts you out of the fight and into the transcendent stuff that undergirds everything that's being said in first and second Corinthians. And with that, we have unlocked the second Corinthians achievement next time around the book of Galatians. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
