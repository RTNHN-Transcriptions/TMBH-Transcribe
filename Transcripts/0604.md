 I am a man who has been punched a few times. I guess not really as a man, all the times I got punched were as a kid. But I felt it. I know what it feels like to get punched. None of it was from a family member or anything. As kids at school, you fight with people and it's just how life goes. They hit you and you hit them back and eventually you respect each other and you work it out. And then I've been hitting sports a whole bunch too. I've played all the sports, all the contact sports. I really like contact. I seek out contact in the sports that I play and it means that there's a lot of give and take. And whether you're talking about getting hit with somebody in a fist fight or more often for me, hit with like a shoulder or a hip or whatever in the course of playing a sport, there's still a really neat division in my brain between two types of hits. You get the hits that you take where you knew it was coming and then you get the hits that you take where you didn't know it was coming. Now the first one's not fun, but you can roll with that because a billion little things in your brain say you're about to get hit, you're about to get hit, you're about to get hit. And consciously you might have time to do like one or two things, throw an arm up, turn a shoulder, whatever. But subconsciously, oh my goodness, have you ever watched that kind of thing in slow motion? Your body just knows what to do. There are a jillion ways that it adjusts and moves and tightens and relaxes and rolls to absorb that hit and minimize the damage you take from that contact. But when it's freaky is when you don't know. And this is the stuff that you see in sporting events where somebody just doesn't see a hit coming and they get lit up or somebody is out, they get hurt and they're not in control of their capacities when they hit the surface and the ground, the turf, the ice, whatever it is. And you're like, oh no, that person wasn't guarding themselves at all. There's something really scary about seeing a human out like that or surprised by contact because subconsciously we all know, oh, if you're going to take a hit, you got to tense up, you got to recognize that there's a bunch of things you got to do and when you don't know, it goes way, way worse. The same exact hit if you see it coming can turn out to be the kind of thing that you can roll right out of and actually even gain momentum or advantage out of it. But if you don't see it coming, it can be absolutely devastating. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 24, it would seem that despite all of the important and meaningful rabbit trails that we have had to track down at the most basic level, this chapter, which is all red letters with Jesus talking, is about him in some at times cryptic, at times vague ways saying here's the way history is going to play out. I'm not going to give you all the details about the exact day or the hour because all of that is reserved for my father and I don't even know the exact day or the hour. But what I know is that all of these things that have been promised, it's all going to happen. Heaven and Earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. These promises about the unfolding of history and that there is an end to history and that we're not done here. Those things you can take them to the bank. That's great. We get it. We can follow the flow of thought. We get the big picture. But what are we supposed to do with all of this information or limited information? Ah ha! Matthew 2442, Jesus says, therefore, in light of all that stuff, keep watch because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. And the rest of chapter 24 is two illustrations that round out and flesh out that concept or to tie it back into the thing we're talking about with get and hit, you want to, as it pertains to the unfolding of time and history, be in a situation where your eyes are up and you are anticipating the contact. And physically, you got a couple of things that you're consciously doing, but subconsciously, you got a billion things that your brain is doing with your time and your emotions and your investment and your attitude and your use of resources and all these things that are all adjusted to the reality of this coming impact, that coming impact being the unfolding of time and the return of the son of man, the end of an age and the beginning of the next thing. You want to be eyes up. You want to keep watch. Can't tell you exactly why or exactly how this will benefit you in the same way. I can't tell you exactly how or why knowing a hit is coming is better than not knowing a hit is coming, but there's a whole lot of little adjustments that are going to happen. You do not want to be according to the home stretch of Matthew 24, the one whose eyes are down, staring at their shoes, not paying attention to what's going on around them. And this gigantic hit is coming and nothing consciously or subconsciously is occurring in you to prepare for that or absorb it or respond to it rightly when it goes down. In light of that, Jesus goes on into verse 43 and gives this little parable about an order of a house and says, but understand this, if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming he would have kept watch and would not have let the house be broken into. So you also must be ready because the son of man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. I don't know what the master would have done in this story. If he was awake and he knew the thief was coming and then the thief showed up, maybe he would have stopped him at gunpoint, maybe he would have had all of his servants go out there with torches and be like, Ha ha! We caught you. You're surrounded. You can't thief anything now. Maybe the owner of the home would have set up an overly elaborate Rube Goldberg style set of booby traps. The thieves would have to navigate to try to get into his house and steal stuff, but one way or another, if he's eyes up and he sees the hit coming, there's going to be conscious and subconscious adjustments about his orientation to be ready, but he doesn't know exactly when the thief is going to be there. So the state of constant readiness for the hit and orientation toward alertness and understanding of where everything is going is really important. The next parable, which we spend a lot of time considering in light of the fact that the Greek word doulas is what Jesus employs here. So most of your translations are going to use the word servant. The original language most literally would mean slave here. And Jesus goes on to say, who then is the faithful and wise servant whom the master is put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? It'll be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. I'll tell you the truth, put him in charge of all of his possessions. Okay, here now we're not going from the perspective of the master. We've pivoted slightly from the last analogy where the master corresponds to probably more like you, the person who's curious about the end of things and needs to be eyes up and oriented, ready for the hit, ready for the unfolding of things. Now the master would appear to correspond to God, Jesus, but the servant would correspond to you or me. And the idea is that the son of man, the master is metaphorically away, but is going to return at any given time. And so whoever is a kingdom citizen, whoever's committed to the son of man, whoever is committed to these values should in anticipation of this big event that's coming in anticipation of the reality that at any point this big hit is coming. They should be oriented in all kinds of obvious and less obvious ways toward doing the things the master would want. And if you know the master is coming, you are properly braced and prepared in a whole lot of manners for that eventual return and to be positioned properly when that eventual return happens. But verse 48, suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, I'm master staying away a long time. And then he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a day when he did not expect him. And in an hour he's not aware of. And what you're getting here is like the equivalent of not being ready for the hit. You don't want to be the servant who's like, I don't know, things have been pretty easy around here and pretty lax for super long time. I don't think there is actually a next thing that's ever going to come. And this is a pinnacle of foolishness. So the guard is down, the body is not ready, the hit surprises that individual. And this is going to be the person who is not prepared and who's body and psyche and subconscious systems are therefore not able to absorb the hit and it's going to be catastrophic. And that's the language of verse 51. I'll cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. I know I've been teasing for a while that we're going to talk about that cut him to pieces thing. Simply put, this is not a new expression at the time of Jesus. This is an expression that characterizes justified outrage on the part of the master of a house or a king toward the wickedness and delinquency and failures, intentional failures of a servant. And so even in Daniel, when Daniel gets stuff right and the leaders and rulers and astrologers and everybody else gets stuff wrong, but Daniel's enemies dupe Darius, the mead into throwing Daniel into the lion's den being bound up by his own word. And then when Daniel survives and he comes out, the response to that this Persian governor or maybe king of some sort gives is like, Oh, we're going to cut them to pieces and throw them into the lion's den. And again, I don't pretend for a moment like this kind of language that existed in the ancient world, the classical world, the Near East was like fun or friendly, but expressions are things. And we can see from conversation, even as recently as a couple chapters back at the end of 21, that everybody on all sides of the conversation expected that if somebody willfully and intentionally mistreated or murderously, mismanaged to other servants that the master of the house would punish them profusely. And in chapter 21, remember Jesus gave that parable at the landowner and he sent representatives to collect the rent, the proceeds and the tenants were like, Oh, this is beat him up. And then the lander was like, What the heck? I'll send my own son. They won't mistreat him. And then they kill the landowner's son. And then Jesus asks the Pharisees, the religious leaders who were there like, Oh, what do you think that the owner of the vineyard is going to do when he comes back to those tenants? And the Pharisees themselves agree. He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, they replied, and he will rent the vineyard to another tenant who will give his share of the crop at harvest time. The short little rabbit trail point here being that this violent verbiage at the end is something that we see inside and outside the Bible all over the place. And its language that apparently was used to express the justified right of a master of a house who had been taken advantage of cheated, even cheated murderously to exact punishment on the people who committed that injustice or that travesty against him or others. I got a little bit more than I want to do here with this concluding set of thoughts on Matthew Chapter 24, but I also don't want to rush it. So we're going to pause. We're going to pick up right where we left off. And tomorrow we will land the plane on Matthew Chapter 24. Pretty fun. A mat is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
