<<<<<<< HEAD
 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's The Grand Finale. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and you and I just finished up a thing together. We went through the whole Bible one book per day until we're done, and I feel really good about it. I've got a much better sense of how the Bible works than I ever have before than maybe you just read through the Bible, right along with me. Maybe you went and picked up some of the readings here and there to get a sense of different stuff. But for me, wow, this was humbling. I guess I genuinely thought at the outset of this that, well, you know, all that time I've spent reading the Bible and everything. I think I should be able to knock this out. It shouldn't be too tough. I was wrong. It was tough. This is very hard. I am reminded that this is a complex book with a lot going on with a lot of words that covers a lot of history. And there's a lot of cross-referencing and trying to figure out how this relates to that that you got to think about. And it's cool. I mean, it's part of the enchantment of the Bible that makes you want to keep coming back as you feel like it is a very, very deep well. But it pushed me. This was super, super hard in a good way. I have never in my life been as saturated in Bible as I have been for the last three and a half, four months, whatever it's been. What an amazing feeling to have that much Bible in my brain at once. I've never felt that before. And it's not like I have the whole thing, you know, never eyes drawn, locked down. I find myself already going back and re-listening to episodes from the series to be like, okay, now what happened in that book again? And what did I see there? And like, okay, oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. So I'm already using this as a resource for myself as well. But I will say this, I've never had this much Bible in my active, readily accessible memory part of my brain at once ever in my entire life. And so as I go around through life, just, you know, doing business and running around town and hanging out with friends and watching a movie or a TV show or playing sports or listening to music or looking at Twitter or whatever, it is amazing. How much stuff from the Bible is popping into my mind every time I see anything? I'm like, oh, yeah, that's just like that thing from Joel. Oh, it's totally like what Amos said in that one place. Well, remember that thing from Jude? It's just like that. And I think that's pretty fun. Even if obviously I don't have a comprehensive understanding of the entire Bible at the level that the real true Bible mega genius scholars do. But I know that there's a wide variety of places that you are coming from as you have gone through the Bible with me here. I know that there's some of you who are absolutely blessed with a gift of faith and clarity and vision for things that are spiritual and involve God. And you see that in every moment of your life and you just wanted an excuse to spend more time around the Bible because it's life giving and clarifying for you. Hopefully this is a useful exercise. I know that also some of you who are listening are a little more like me where you just can't help but have some of the skepticism and some of the obnoxious, raise your hand and ask questions every five seconds kind of approach to the thing. But also there's joy in the discovery of how it hangs together. And if you're like me, I'm imagining this was an encouraging process for you because it's one of those deals where you look close almost kind of peering through your fingers like, man, I really think there's a God behind this and it'd be really cool if there were. And all right, we're going to go dive deep into the Bible and let's see what we see. And then you look close with me and you're like, huh, this is even better than I thought it was this smacks of truth and continuity and even so many of the critiques that might spring into my own mind or that I hear from other people. No, the Bible seems to be able to bear the weight of those pretty well. I know that there are others of you who have been around church and then some went wrong. I don't know. It was something inside. It was a church thing. Maybe some kind of calamity. I really, really get that. Maybe you just numb from the spirit of the age and that 80s, 90s, early 2000s, youth group kind of Christianity made a lot of sense. And then things got weird culturally. And I know for some of you, crisis is the right word and you miss when there was clarity to things spiritually and about God and you would welcome that. But also you feel a degree of turmoil about it and a degree of turmoil about going to church. I get it. I hope that for you going through this process, it eliminated the middle man as much as possible and put you in a place where you could quickly digest a whole bunch of Bible and Bible ideas. And maybe hit the reset button a little bit and go back to the basics of what the whole thing, the whole narrative of God and the Bible about all of history and where people fit. Maybe you could hit the reset button on that a little bit and find some encouragement in it. I know there are others of you who are just straight up. Unpersuaded that there is a God at all. But you're intrigued by religion. You are highly empathetic and you care about robust systems of thought that inform other people's lives and assumptions and you looked at this and you were like, huh, yeah, this would be a relatively efficient way to understand this very influential document and I'll give it a go. As I've said before, I have huge respect for that level of thinking outside of yourself and that level of intellectual curiosity. And for you, I hope that at minimum, you come away going, man, there really is a tremendous amount of internal cohesion to that. And maybe at a maximum, I don't know, I'll just straight up say it. I hope you come away from looking that closely at the Bible and you're like, well, maybe there is a God. I want to think about this some more. And further, I know that there are a bunch of people listening to this who do believe there's a God, but you have a completely different set of convictions about that than I do. Maybe from completely a different religion or maybe a very different expression of Christian faith, whoever you are, wherever you're coming from, I think it's amazing that we found a way to get together and think about something that we're told supposedly everybody's supposed to fight about and just be mad about all the time. But we didn't, we just hung out together and talked about things that are transcendent and meaningful. And hopefully we did all of that with the underlying assumption that you can just dismiss anything you want to about my opinions or what I'm saying. I mean, come on, it's podcasts. You can do whatever you want. And maybe just ratcheting down that pressure a little bit makes it that much easier for us to think about deep water stuff with people who aren't just exactly like us in every single way. And I am very hungry for that at this point in the unfolding of history and culture and our civilization. So whoever you are, wherever you're coming from, thank you for doing this. I wouldn't want it any other way. The big picture, maybe final word here on this whole, what do we do with the Bible thing and what did we just read? I've been thinking about it like this. It seems like the Bible covers four eras, maybe five, and it leaves a question mark about one more that even though I don't have an answer for it, I want to ask on the way out the doors. We wrap up this series here. The first era. Yeah, yeah, I'm going to divide it up like this. The first era is before time. This is before existence as we know existence. And we get a little glimpse into that world where there is God pure being essence. I am. And God decides that instead of there not being things, there are going to be things. And that gets us into this second era, which is the bulk of the Old Testament. God makes stuff and sin and failure and destruction and injustice and wrongness and entropy and the second law of thermodynamics breaking down everything that is destructive gets introduced into that beautiful thing that God built. And then God rather than deciding that he was going to wash his hands of it, start over, he decides he's going to redeem it. So we learned something about God in this second part. And that is that if he's unlimited and he's powerful enough to make everything, he's powerful enough to know how it was going to go. And it was within his purposes and designs that he would make something that of its own volition would go off the rails and that then of his own volition, he would redeem because all I can assume is that redeeming must bring him some kind of great pleasure. And redeeming points to his glory and godness. And so he sets out on this redemptive plan. But in the Old Testament, what we see are a whole bunch of attempts, different things that naturally anybody reading the text or philosophizing about life in the world in this context would consider as a solution. Like, well, OK, God, well, let's try this. Why don't you have the people do that? What do you give them a leader like this then? Oh, that didn't work. Well, let's give them a different setup. Let's have like a council of leaders who know that didn't work either. Well, let's have them like have wars and stuff. So they'll appreciate what they have more. No, that didn't work either. Now, let's have this religious sacrifice. I mean, you see what I'm driving at through the whole Old Testament as we've discussed so many times, we see a whole bunch of attempts at making things right and solving the problem that are very human centric that involve people really getting their act together and finally through leaning into better character and better judgment and listening to the words of God through the prophets and having better institutions. We solve the human problem. We get things right. And it just keeps not working. And the whole Old Testament just reads like this cycle of failures. But every time we go through one of those cycles of failure in the Old Testament and yes, if you can hear it, I'm making that cycle gesture with my left hand as I talk. Every time we go through one of those cycles, there's also this glimmer of hope, this reminder that's built in like, hey, there is a paradigm that will work and it is coming and it is going to happen. And as you go through the Old Testament, that paradigm becomes more and more clear. And then we get into the next era, which I think is a very short era of the Bible. That's the era where Jesus himself is physically in the world. And Jesus repeatedly talked about this little era as being very unique and very special. But this is the part where the paradigm change happens. This is the new deal, the new covenant. This is where the heavy lift shifts from, well, here are all the different ways we could have humans try to really work this thing out to. OK, can we just all admit that humans cannot solve this catastrophe, that this is a calamity that we cannot put back together? We can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. God is going to have to do all the lift on this in order for it to work. And so God shows up, puts on flesh, lives this perfect life, teaches this stuff, goes to the cross, dies and is resurrected. And that little window, that's the ticket. That's the, that's the pivot moment for the whole thing. But Jesus himself said during that time that there would be a variety of responses to this culminating moment in the redemptive plan. And then we get the fourth era of the Bible. And I think that's the one we're in right now. It's the one that I guess you could call the age of the church. And it looks like in the New Testament, even a lot of people were like, great. OK, well, everything is solved and we're done here. Jesus won. And so I guess now is the time for the reckoning and to judge all the nations and to sort out all the evil and bad things that have ever happened. And now there can be heaven and the kingdom. So let's just do it. Let's just end history. But that isn't what happened. Jesus made it clear like, you don't really need to worry about that. We'll get to that. In the meantime, go tell other people about this thing and let there be a tangible representation of my kingdom in the world. And even though people wanted there to be a timeline, there has not been a timeline. And we're still in this era right now. The downside of this is that you have to continue to endure evil and injustice and all of the failures of the kingdoms of this world. But the upside to this very long extended church era is the you and I exist. Probably like a hundred years ago, everybody was like, man, we need to wrap this thing up. It is time for the end of the church era. That was nice, but it's time for God to just close it out, let there be a reckoning, redeem all things. And if they got their wish, you and I simply never would have existed to even be aware of this story ever. So if anybody wished for that a hundred years ago, I'm glad they didn't get what they wanted and that God saw fit to extend this age of the church for, I assume, the greater purposes of his glory. When he ultimately brings about that day of the Lord and judges the stuff that is wrong and also demonstrates his grace and the full manifestation of this kingdom we've been reading about in the Bible to those who are in Christ. It's kind of exciting. Finally, the Bible describes an era that is not yet happened, but that will happen in the future. And this day of the Lord idea where there's a reckoning and God does judge all of the accumulated evil and injustice and cruelty and awfulness that it looked like was just going to go. Untouched, but God did not forget and he will bring about justice for that. And also he will bring about forgiveness and pardon for those who were in him and then the kingdom is realized and established. And it looks like the story, the arc as it is described to us wraps up with God living in communion with his people, with his family of faith that he has built. And he's glorified in that and that's where the story wraps up. So I think that's a pretty awesome front to end. Look at what's going on here. It's cohesive. It hangs together, but it does leave one more question that I don't know the answer to. And that is what happens after that. What's the next project? What's the next thing that God wants to explain about himself or demonstrate to all of existence and what role do people who are a part of that kingdom get to play? I think it's kind of fun and interesting and awe inspiring to speculate about that undiscovered country, that next thing that happens and what that looks like. And I think I'm content to just let that be a question that hangs out there for you and me moving forward. I know I've said it about a hundred times. Let's say it one more. Thanks for doing this with me. It was a very meaningful exercise and my life will not be the same ever. This was truly transformative for me and I'm grateful as we wrap up this series right now. We are officially two days away as I'm recording this from starting the next one on the Book of Esther. I've told you about that over the last few days set in Persia. There's all kinds of history and super interesting, colorful characters. And it's the only book of the Bible that doesn't mention God. What gives? What's the deal with that? We're going to tear into all of that stuff with a pretty solid deep dive into Persian history on the front end of it. Starting on Monday and I'd be super grateful if you'd be apart and maybe even bring along a friend. Finally, I got to say thank you to the people who support the program. There's a bunch of different ways to do it. I don't need to get into all of that. But you can find out about if you want to at thetmbh.com slash support. The simple way to put it is this podcast only exists because some of you do that. And I know I've had my wife saying thanks a whole bunch at the end of every episode, but really truly. It means a world that you would invest in this thing and make it happen. And also, I suppose that you would invest in my family in that way as well. So thank you to everybody who's done that at any point in any way along the way. It just means a ton. All right, my friends. Season three of the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast on the Book of Esther starts on Monday and I can't wait. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

And I know I've had my wife saying thanks a whole bunch at the end of every episode, but really truly, it means a world that you would invest in this thing and make it happen. And also, I suppose that you would invest in my family in that way as well. So thank you to everybody who's done that at any point in any way along the way. It means a ton. And my friends, season three of the 10 minute Bible hour podcast on the Book of Esther starts on Monday. And I can't wait. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
