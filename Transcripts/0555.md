 All right. Look, given the nature of the medium here, there's no way for me to know where you're listening to this right now. But regardless of whether you are laying quietly in bed, whether you're in the grocery store, whether you're in a big crowd of bathroom, in a long line of full stalls and everybody's trying to be quiet and discreet about it, whether you're at a funeral and you're in a particularly boring part and you got an earbud in because you're just trying to get through it. My condolences, by the way, no matter where you're at, I just want you to listen to the following question and then shriek out the answer when I say go so you can look awesome in front of everybody and believe me, no matter where you are, everyone will be impressed. Here we go. Name the seven wonders of the ancient world. Go. Come on, you got the last one. Come on, grind through it, grind through it. Okay, now I know you all got it right. But just for people who are coming in late, I'm going to bring them up to speed. You got the great pyramid, you got the mausoleum, you got the hanging gardens, the statue of Zeus, the colossal roads, I might not get them all temple of Artemis. Somebody yell at me, which one am I forgetting? I'm in charge of this. I'm not editing this out. I'm going to think of it. It's the lighthouse, the lighthouse. That's seven. One, two, three, four. Yes, that's seven. Okay, I had to labor a little bit more than I thought I was going to have to there. Hopefully you did better and everyone's terribly impressed that you knew the thing. Mayors of point, there's a reason that this list came together throughout the centuries of the distant past. And it's because there were just some buildings, some accomplishments that popped so hard that if you ever had the good fortune to see it, you just had to pause and take in the grandeur of this thing. The great pyramid was like the tallest building that humans had ever figured out how to build until the 19th century or something. It's more than 10 acres in space, just covered by a building that people built in a pre-industrial age. How the heck did they even do that? The mausoleum of what is it called? Halicarnassus is some like totally unknown, mostly forgotten to history, a little back corner footnote of modern day Turkey, where a sad lady who was married to her brother was like, I am going to build the greatest monument ever to somebody who is coming gone and is dead. And so she built this incredible thing. It was like 100 feet and change tall. The Colossus, it roads is the thing that that sculpture and Game of Thrones is based on. I can't remember the name of that sculpture that says bravos. The Titan of bravos is based on the Colossus it wrote. And it was only up for a little while, but that was a bronze sculpture that you could sail boats, like, right between his legs and just sail under there. Don't look up. These things were incredible. And there's a reason that they developed this amazing reputation that spans through the ages. Well, something that you could make a case maybe belonged on that list of seven wonders of the ancient world. If perhaps they'd made the list just a little bit later would be Herod's temple, the second temple, if you will, the entire temple complex might be another way to put it as it stood in the time of Jesus of Nazareth. This building was mind boggling. And as we work through the book of Matthew, it's just floating around in the background as I don't know, like a geographical center point that comes to mind from time to time. There's lots of chit chat about the temple and lots of chit chat around the temple. Seems like people gather there and talk there. But I'm not sure there's anything I can do to properly put myself in a place to understand how significant the influence of this building was. And perhaps serving as evidence of how difficult it is to fully appreciate the grandeur of this building and why it probably really did belong on the list of the seven wonders of the ancient world, maybe even top of the list, is if we just look at the human reaction of the disciples to the temple in Matthew chapter 24, they've been raised in a temple culture. They've been raised around the idea of a temple. I mean, some notion of a temple had been around for more or less entirely a thousand years prior to this point. And probably a lot of the disciples had seen the temple before they arrived there with Jesus. I mean, at least a few of them, we know that they had some sort of family wealth or property that bled over into the Jerusalem area. So they would have gone there. Jesus had seen the temple as a boy, at least on one occasion, probably more than that. But even so, the disciples at the beginning of chapter four, after all of this hubbub and the natural buzz socially that comes from a big time confrontation that just got done happening throughout the statement of the seven woes in Matthew chapter 23, they get done with that and they're just standing there and they're like, yeah, all of that. Yeah. But think about this building. How did they do that? Look at how tall it is. Look how big these bricks are. This is just bonkers. And every time I look at it, it blows my mind all over again. This has got to be like one of the coolest things that humans have ever built. And they're standing there marveling at it. You know, paraphrases mine, but it's not tough to read between the lines. That's kind of the attitude that they have in this little passage at the beginning of Matthew 24. Jesus left the temple and was walking away when God had a page turn there. Hang on a second. His disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. And then Jesus replies, do you see all these things he asked? I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another. Everyone will be thrown down. And before we even get into the prophecy and all those other things that I was hinting at yesterday, I just want to take a minute to appreciate this building and its significance in terms of scale and meaning. The disciples here come off like eager kids in the back of the wood sided station wagon in the 1950s, looking out the little spaces they can see through the windows because they're all covered with the decals of all the places where we've already been. And they see something amazing, like a building or a monument. And they're like, dad, dad, dad, dad. Look at that thing. And they're just experiencing childlike awe. And I don't say that as a criticism of them at all. Childlike awe is the best. I feel this moment of empathy and and relatability to the disciples here because they're excited about this. And at the same time, though, they're not little kids and they are going to be more likely to think about the engineering behind it. Or you can't help with me. Like, how would a guy do something like that? In any sense that they're musing about it that maybe somehow what Matthew isn't telling us here is that part of that musing is regarding the grandeur of not just the buildings but the stones from which is constructed because Jesus response points them back to those stones. There were stones there that weighed up to and even in excess of 600 tons. How do you move that? I mean, this isn't one of those stone churches that you see in Ethiopia where they carved the church in relief out of a rock. It's a carved church. No, they went and cut these stones uphill from the temple mount. And then they had to find a way with a little bit of the benefit of gravity to get them down the hill and into position. I read somewhere, maybe it was just the Wikipedia article that they labeled the stones. They think back up at the quarry and that way they moved them right into position and wasted as little energy as possible. You don't want to move a 600 ton stone one inch further than you have to. 600 tons is nuts. So you think about what two things you use to compare to anything that's gigantic when you want to conceptualize a football field for size and you go with a bus for weight. So I'm going to Google that just now. It looks like 20,000 pounds is about right for a big school bus, 30,000 pounds loaded down with those kids. Holy cow, thanks for 10,000 pounds were the kids on there. Maybe we want to back off putting fruit rollups in those lunchboxes there, moms. Let's say it's 30,000 pounds. And this website is telling the truth. So 30,000 pounds is 2,000 pounds is a ton. That's 15 tons per school bus. So 10 times 15, 10 school buses is 150 tons. Let's double that 20 school buses 300, 30 school buses for 50, 40 school buses, 40 school buses. And that's not like that's the weight of the temple. That's a weight of one rock, one stone that they made this temple out of. This is superlative. This is the biggest thing that you can imagine people achieving. These walls are the thickest walls. You can imagine anybody building the temples 150 feet high. And you might be like, oh, it doesn't really sound like all that much. I just went to SeaWorld with my kids for a little family trip thing. And what's the highest drop there on the make-o? It's like 220 feet. That's insanely high. Even if it's 70 feet lower than that, it's insanely high. And you're building that out of stuff that would be virtually impossible to lift in those days. No wonder they were astonished by it. And then on top of that, you got the sheer acreage. It's like 35, I should have written this down. I don't have it in front of me. It's a 35 acre platform that is this entire temple complex. Again, the great pyramid is what? 10, 12, 15 acres that it covers, which is a huge footprint. But the temple complex is even way bigger than that. It's so big. It's so strong. It's such a grand production that it would be difficult for anybody to imagine anything more powerful than whatever institution that represents. That would seem just about as permanent as anybody could imagine, even though construction had just finished on it, or was maybe even not quite totally done at this point as the disciples are marveling at it. We're taking this extra time to talk about the temple and the impression it would have made on people, the place it would have occupied in their imaginations. One, because it's just interesting and it's fun to talk about. Because I think it's really important to understanding the stuff that's about to unfold through the rest of the book of Matthew. The temple factors really big on a lot of levels. We got to take a bit of time to put ourselves in their shoes before we really tear into 24 and onto the rest of the chapter in order to set ourselves up for success. Next time around, we'll be talking about the story behind it and the implications and how that would have loomed large as well in the next couple of days. Hey, we had a little issue with the back catalog, all of the old episodes, everything before like 100 episodes ago went offline. It was some software issue with the people who host this, the company who host this. I think we got it straightened out. If you can't listen to those back catalog episodes yet on your particular podcast app, I know they are all back up on iTunes and they're all back up on the website, which is thetmbh.com slash podcasts. If you want more details on that, I did post a bonus episode that is a press conference we did today to answer a lot of the questions that people had about that. There was some intensity there. It was not an easy thing for me to face some of those questions, but I'm glad we did in the interest of transparency. Hopefully that was helpful. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. You
