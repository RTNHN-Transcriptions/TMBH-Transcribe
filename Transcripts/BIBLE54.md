 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about First Timothy. As we turn the page here from 2 Thessalonians over to First Timothy, there is an ever-so-subtle shift in genre that is occurring. All of the letters of Paul we've seen so far have been letters to churches, Romans 1 and 2 Corinthians, then go eat popcorn, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and then 1st and 2nd Thessalonians. All of those open with some version of Paul and Apostle of Christ, because I'm enthusiastic about your church and I want to obey God. I write to the church in Corinth. I mean, it's a very ugly paraphrase, but they all start something like that. Well, First Timothy opens the same. Paul and Apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God, our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, our hope. All right, that's all pretty familiar. We read on to Timothy, my true son, in the faith. Aha! There's the wrinkle of difference. We are moving out of the letters of Paul that are written to churches, and we're moving into a new chunk of letters that are written to church leaders or people in churches, giving them guidance about how to lead or how to play their role in the church. And the first of these pastoral epistles, as they're often called, is written to Paul's protege, Timothy. Timothy is representative of, I guess you could say, generation 3 of Christianity. It's generation 1, as the people who Jesus met in physical person during his pre-crucifixion lifetime. And then generation 2 are the Christians who came after Jesus' death and resurrection. Well, then generation 3 would be the people that generation 2 reached. And that is what happened with Timothy, because during Paul's second missionary journey, he makes a trip through central Turkey. This is probably in the late 40s AD. And he goes to this one town called Lystra, where he meets a family that includes this young man, Timothy. And Timothy is half Jewish and half Greek. That in and of itself makes him a very versatile player in this whole go-reach people journey that Paul is on. Everywhere he goes, he's talking to Jews and Greeks. That's how he's approaching it. So here's Timothy. Somebody who's promising and who Paul decides he can deeply invest in. This turned out to be an excellent intuition on Paul's part, because Timothy kicks butt. He's fantastic. He is reliable. He is teachable. And he matures into a great Christian leader. Timothy is along for the ride and learns a whole bunch about how church works and about what Paul is going for and about what God's Holy Spirit is doing. And at the time, first Timothy gets written, this guy's not really a kid anymore. He's been doing this for over a decade. He knows his way around. He's got a reputation. And that's why when Paul hears about trouble in his beloved Church of Ephesus, where he's invested so much time, he picks Timothy from his team of people he works with to be the guy who addresses those problems. And it takes a little bit of a pep talk because Timothy is stepping up a level in responsibility here. And so the tone that we get in first Timothy differs from the tone that we get in all of those letters that are written to churches that are going to be read aloud to a big diverse grand audience. Even more candid tone than what we get there. Paul has never wanted to mince words, but he's really not minceing words with Timothy. He is cutting right to the chase on things to do his very best to set his protege and this church he loves in Ephesus up for success. Well, it looks like the problem in Ephesus is that this church has become literally confused and metaphorically fat and a little bit self satisfied and a little bit missing the point. That's what Paul wants Timothy to do is to confront some of the excesses, the abuses, some of the false teaching that is starting to take root. Some of the weird pride stuff that is starting to manifest that is causing chaos and that is making the church an Ephesus look dumb and ineffective and like it's driven by world kingdom values in front of all the other people in the city of Ephesus who aren't Christians yet. Paul is specifically commissioning and equipping Timothy to solve the immediate problems of the Ephesian church and to settle in for the long haul. You guys are going to be a church here for a while. So you've got to live right in this community. You've got to be as Jesus says in Matthew chapter five at the beginning of the first of the five big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured the sermon on the Mount. As Jesus says there, you got to be salt and light. Timothy, go explain to the Ephesians that they got to be salt and light. They've got to be a pointer or representative, a preservative, a flavoring, an insertion of kingdom values in the middle of world darkness in that city where they are strategically positioned by God to represent his kingdom. Well, the way the book plays out is we start off by getting a sense of some of these false teachers and it looks like they're dipping back selectively into Old Testament stuff that they don't understand. They're just butchering it. And surely Paul is someone who probably had the whole Bible memorized given his training is here in the arguments that these clowns are making. He's probably just face Paul and thinking, oh my goodness, that is amateur hours bushy garbage. If he were there, it'd be really easy to just knock over these idiotic arguments. But instead he has to pump up Timothy to go and do that because Paul cannot be there at this time. Well, these guys are saying that there should be all kinds of dietary restrictions inflicted on everybody and that somehow their weird read of the Old Testament says that marriage should be abolished. We just shouldn't do that anymore. And we find out a little bit later on that much like the mistakes that were being made in Thessalonica that here in Ephesus, these clown teachers are also saying, oh, the resurrection. That stuff already happened. We missed it. So in response to that, in the early going of this first letter from Paul to Timothy, Paul is going to say, no, that's not what the Old Testament says. It's not what the Old Testament does. Paul's already made this point in other letters we've encountered in the Bible. But he's saying, no, the Old Testament points out the failure of humanity. It points out our sin and it points us toward our need for Jesus. That's what it does. If you read that in a Christian context and you come away saying that all marriage should be dissolved or abolished, you are totally missing the point. Then Paul is saying to Timothy, once you've dealt with this stupid teaching and the stuff that doesn't make any sense, you've got to tackle the things that are causing chaos in the church and that make everybody look bad. And that gets us into a passage that has caused much controversy over the years where Paul talks about certain women in this church who are also missing the point, but in a different way than those male false teachers from before. They are wearing extravagant, elaborate, decadent clothing in a church where super poor people also attend. And it looks like with no qualification or knowledge whatsoever, they are using their uppity status socially in the community and their wealth as a justification to go up to the front and teach people whatever their ideas are. And those are also destructive and missing the point. So Paul says a bunch of stuff about how he doesn't allow women to teach. And he supports this position he holds by pointing back to imagery from the garden and the sin of Adam and Eve and how that all unfolded. Through the years, people have looked at this passage and said, the language of the text is clear. This is universal. What Paul is telling Timothy to do is how it is supposed to be in all churches for all time. Other people look at that and say, yeah, but Priscilla is one of the founding teachers and leaders in this church. And like the whole Ephesus Church kind of in part exists because of stuff that she did. So maybe Paul is saying something that is more specific to the behavior of these women and their teaching. I am going to excuse myself from settling that one in this brief conversation, but I will offer this last word. How people tend to read that passage and what they tend to do with it seems to correspond very closely to whatever presuppositions we bring to the text. I encourage you to dig deeper on that question for yourselves and grace and peace to everybody understanding that I will not live long enough to see ultimate agreement on some of these questions that come out of these parts of the Bible. However you understand it to be best to extrapolate that text out to the larger church. What is crystal clear is Paul is saying we got two different recipes for chaos and insanity coming from the men of the church, coming from certain women in the church and both of these things are problems and Timothy, come on man, you got to handle this. You've got this. This is what you were made for. This is what you've been training for. I know it's not going to be easy. Those are very fancy, very rich, very intimidating women and they're not going to make it easy for you. And those men who are false teachers butchering the Old Testament, they are loud. They are aggressive. It's going to be tough as a young man, but don't get intimidated. Don't let them look down on you because you're young. You are on the side of what is right here. It is your job to bring truth and clarity and peace to this church. So it is built for the long haul and you got this thing. And it's a good thing that Paul is giving him that encouragement because there's a laundry list at the end of the book, stuff that he is supposed to go and tackle. And again, this letter is very candid, very direct. As Paul is writing to someone he is very invested in and to someone who very much knows Paul's thinking and dance steps, he's really cutting right to the chase about what the problems are. And indeed so much so that he even names names of some of these false teachers at different points. Further, Timothy is going to need the support because he's supposed to gently and deftly confront some of the older men in the church who apparently have gotten into public drunkenness. But Paul goes out of his way to make sure Timothy understands like I'm not saying that any kind of wine or alcohol is prohibited. Probably there were some people arguing that. In fact, Paul seems to be taking into account the stress or maybe even ulcers that the pressure of all of this might cause Timothy. He's like, take a little wine. It might help settle your stomach. And I think that little personal admonition was a very intentional shrewd move on the part of Paul so that Timothy would not mistake this correction that needed to happen over this public drunkenness for an out and out prohibition. Further, Paul commissions Timothy to go and shrewdly deftly address some of the imbalances in the relationship between servants, bond servants and their household masters, even slaves and their household masters. Now Paul's agenda has always been to call out slavery and point to the reality of the family of faith as nullifying that as trumping those social relationships. Slaves are just as much a brother or sister in the family of Christ as anybody else regardless of what Roman paperwork and legal status might say. And Paul demands excellent treatment, brotherly and sisterly relationships, even in households that do have servants and slaves. But he's clever. If he goes out and attacks the entire institution of slavery overtly and publicly, you become an enemy of Rome and they are going to crush your movement with violence and force before it can get off the ground. So Paul is condemning slavery, undercutting slavery, but he's doing so very shrewdly and he's inviting Timothy to thread that needle along with him. I guess maybe Timothy better take a sip of that wine here or there to call him his stomach. This letter really does strike a very different conversational tone than what we've seen in the letters that Paul was right into the different churches. And the Bible and Christianity are better for it because we're getting this inside look at a proper strategic approach to what a community of faith is to be internally and what it is to be externally. When you visualize the book of 1 Timothy picture, young Timothy confronting the Ephesian church, that should be the kind of thing that you can conjure an image of in your mind. When you think about the theme reflect on how kingdom values informed church honors God, but it also witnesses to outsiders. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get chapter 4 verses 6 through 16. Achievement unlocked first Timothy. There we go. Second Timothy next time around.
