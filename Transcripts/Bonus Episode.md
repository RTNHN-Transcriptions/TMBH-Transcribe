 the the everybody it's not the ten minute by the lower podcast bonus episode which i guess you know because it is in the song right there that jeff wrote and i guess you also know that it is the ten minute by the lower podcast because that that was the lyrics of the song says that it's a bonus episode of the ten minute by the lower podcast with these are rare we don't do them very often yeah we did one last week and we're doing one this week for good reason i might add but generally speaking do we delete these and clean up the back catalog as we go along because we want that back catalog to be increasingly searchable and to serve as a resource i'm gonna talk more about what we're doing to make the back catalog more useful as we have this conversation that we're gonna have here today for the moment the point is hey if you're hearing this it means that you're up to speed in your get this while it's hot so that's that's pretty cool thanks for being here you know what else thanks for thanks for going through the book of math you are you kidding me we are almost done we had a little bit of twenty seven twenty eight and then some big picture evaluative stuff to do i know that we have either forty five or depending on how i slice it and play it in that last week fifty remaining episodes i say maybe fifty because if we do forty five more which is the number of publishing days we have left before i i want to be done then that lands us on the last day of december at seven ninety five and wouldn't it be better if it were eight hundred because wouldn't it be better if it were eight hundred i don't know i'd be interested in your thoughts on that one forty five or fifty more episodes is what we got left to think about what we've done here though we started on this october fourteen in twenty nineteen so it's going to be three years and two months that you just threw at one book of the bible now if we're doing it right it's not just one book of the bible if we're doing it right we're all over the rest of the bible and we're learning stuff about the other gospels and we're learning stuff about acts and we're learning stuff about all kinds of stuff in the new testament profits and songs and all of that and you have indulged every single rabbit trail i felt like we needed to take everywhere my curiosity has pointed us if you're here you have kindly and graciously gone with me without complaint you are gracious and supportive and i'm so very very thankful that you have leaned into the pace that i wanted to take on this thing and i'm so grateful that i'm getting the impression at least from you that you're up for more i am up for more and i'm talking like a long time this is something that i've enjoyed as much as anything i've ever done in my life ever and i'm up for doing it for a very very long time it is a blast and the community is awesome i get all kinds of feedback from you i hear from you in all sorts of different ways and i tell you what this is not a uniform group of people who you are here with this is a very diverse group of people who think very diverse things so diverse in fact that i think we're all supposed to be scratching and clawing at each other and cannibalizing each other and saying horrible things and describing motives to each other and ascribing blame to each other and burning things down so that some stupid political party can get a little bit more power for two or four years or whatever it is and you seem to be people who are playing by uh... different set of ground rules you seem to be people who have a different set of priorities dare i say kingdom priorities and i like you i wish you could see what i see from my angle it's very hard to characterize it and just put it on the internet or say it into a microphone but i wish you could see what i see in terms of who you are as a group it's pretty admirable as pretty funds pretty encouraging uh... the point is i've interacted with a lot of you and i like you me working through math you by myself for three years and change would be a fantastic monastic exercise in trying to understand god and history and the bible better and it would be valuable and i wouldn't have done it i just would lack the discipline to get it done because you're there and you are how you are and who you are and because you apparently have some of the same curiosity i do about this stuff and because you're at peace as well with trying to look at it through the lenses of now with comparable likewise he stuff and also through the lenses of the original audience in the original witnesses the fact that you're willing to track down the historical rabbit trails and dive deep everywhere the curiosity takes us that keeps me in the game and it's made it so that every single week day for what will end up being basically eight hundred days i've gotten up and engaged with this text and engaged with you that is a gift that you have given me that's not some stupid fake humble thing that you're just supposed to say to do a podcast or whatever i'm not kidding i wouldn't have done this if you weren't there and it's affected my life in huge ways my faith on an individual level is in a different place than when it was when we started this i think about the bible in different categories heck i know the bible so much better than i did before i can see patterns and just make simple connections it may be aren't even super profound but just see it now spread out in front of me in ways that i wouldn't have done that before and so i just thank you so very very much for making me do that and for coming along with me and i don't uh... have the words to properly express how grateful i am to you for all of that we need to talk about what's next the truth of the matter is i'm a teeny tiny bit nervous about what happens next because i just told you how much i love this and i don't know what happens when we moved to a new book i don't know if that makes people be like uh... thinking this that's over that was great enjoyed it but i'm good or if it becomes a kind of thing where people are like now i was just waiting to invite friends and family for the next thing and we see the community of people who are involved get even more diverse and grow even more i don't know i got no idea so i guess uh... were fixing to find out whatever happens i'm moving forward and here is how i'm moving forward january second which i believe is a monday i hope that's a monday that's how i have a written down right now january second twenty twenty three is when we're starting our next thing there will be no break between what we're doing now and what happens next will wrap up Matthew on a friday and then will make ridiculous choices over the course of the new year's eve weekend and then we're gonna stagger back into work on monday the second and then we're gonna pick up on the new thing on monday the second what is the new thing it's not ester ester is the next book of the bible we are going to work through together but before we do that we're gonna take three months and change and we're gonna run through the entire bible i know that sounds a little bit overwhelming we are going to give one episode each book of the bible over the first quarter of twenty twenty three i think we can do it obviously we're not going to be able to cover all the details it'll be a little more surfacey than what we did with matthew but it seems like this is a great time for us to quickly in broad strokes try to get the whole thing in our hip pocket and have a resource that just sits out there to go back in consult if say something takes us to zechariah like i can know i covered that but it's hard to keep all of those straight and we talked about it but i don't remember everything about zechariah cool no problem just scroll back and grab the zechariah episode and the hooks and the details and the little mnemonic devices that we're using that's a little bit inside baseball in our conversation it'll all be there and then we can just draw on that stuff together moving forward and who knows down the road maybe we'll take another run at it and look at all those books of the bible in another way but here we're gonna go general overview general important historical setting detail things and most of all we're just gonna try to get the just the feel the point we're gonna try to answer the question why is this in the bible instead of not in the bible how does this move forward the character revealing it's not character development because god in the bible is held out as being immutable and unchanging we learn more about god and all of the different circumstances and environments and who he is and what he does through the course of all of these books i'm not gonna give myself permission to go twenty thirty forty fifty minutes on these things the format is gonna stay the same will get what we get and again if we need to come back into another series on each book of the bible another time and we can always do that here's my thinking if you got people in your life friends family whatever co-worker i don't know you you know who people are if you've got people you're like thing i like this thing and i would like to be having more conversations with my friends i got friend who i think would dig it but i know they're gonna be overwhelmed by jumping in in the last ten percent of an eight hundred episode series on the book of matthew if you've been thinking i just gotta wait until the time is right something that and tell something more invitable comes along hey hey my friend this is it i would love it if you would start thinking now in terms of who you might want to bring along for the ride on this thing think i'm gonna print a books again i haven't gotten designed yet i thought it'd be cool to do a book said the bible notebook that i could mail out to everybody who supports at any level on patreon look i'm not gonna go check if you want to scan that system by the way that is absolutely fine feel free to scan the system i want you to get the book if i print those out so patreon dot com slash the ten minute by blower podcast for those of you don't know that is how we fund this it's how we make it go this is my primary job with what comes in on patreon here i did pay for basic maintenance stuff equipment some subscriptions and things like that that happened to make this go i paid jeff to edit and to make music and then what's left is our family income and i'm super uncomfortable saying that into a microphone oh my goodness i feel the teeny tiny is little bit of sweat i'm not joking what the heck is the matter with me it's the truth though why am i being weird everybody has a job or hopefully everybody has a job or is trying to get a job and everybody's trying to pay their bills and everybody who's a dad and has a family is trying to work to make that family go and to support them and i'm no different and you make that happen those of you support the program so thank you for supporting the program that is awesome and now back to the point about these notebooks for the two upcoming series on the books of the bible and then on ester after that i want to just mail you those in one mailing because it costs kind of a lot to print those up and then send them out so i'm thinking that somewhere in december maybe late november i don't know how long it's going to take me to get the notebooks in but anybody who's a patron at any level we're just going to send you those notebooks now look i always get a ton of those back in the mail every time we send them that could be the post office that could be you nothing personal but if there's anything weird about the address on patreon uh... it just kicks those things back and that's a bummer not because i feel bad because i spent money to send you the thing that's fine i feel bad because i really genuinely wanted to give you the thing because you support the program and i'm grateful to you and this is one small gesture that i've thought of is a way to express that properly and have kind of a physical touch to this relationship that feels a bit one way most of the time given the nature of the medium so if you want to support the podcast you can you go to patreon.com slash tmbh podcast the way it works is i bill once for each week of podcast so if you sign up and you're like i'm going to give one dollar per week that is awesome and generous and you don't have to and i understand that a dollar a week is a sacrifice but if you do that dollar a week that's the number you want to go with what that means is 52 times per year i am going to charge the patrons through the website for one week of podcast at the end of each month that actually gets charged to your credit card and then after patreon takes out a hefty chunk of fees and after the credit card companies take out uh hefty chunk of fees and after the government takes out a hefty chunk of fees then the rest of that comes in to make the podcast go and to make family stuff go which is great you can also set it up so that you can put a limit on how many weeks you support per month so maybe you're like i want to kick in once a month for like ten bucks that sounds simple it's just how i want to do it no problem just set your monthly limit to one creation one one week of podcast one content creation one charge per month i don't know how they say it would be something like that and then the other weeks of the month that i charge the patrons you just won't be charged from time to time i'll hear from people who say hey you know i've got some hesitations or questions about some of these different support platforms around the internet whether it be paypal or patreon or or whatever and yeah ultimately that's part of why i just want to provide a variety of options because i really do appreciate the support and i want to make that easy and a clean conscience thing for people so what i am doing there is i think we're going to move away from paypal for a direct support option i think we're going to replace that with a thing called a planning center planning center works with a lot of churches maybe some of you are familiar with them already we don't have it set up yet but the idea there is that it does a lot of what patreon does it just gives the person who wants to support a thing the ability to set up what increments and you know when they kick in and some support here there whatever i think it's super customizable and it's just going to be a better fit for what we do so that little support page over on the website and it's uh the tmbh.com probably slash support that'll include a link to the ongoing patreon page but you will also see over there the option for direct support or periodic support if you feel like it through that planning center and then of course people from time to time have asked for my actual mailing address because you see something cool or something that you think is fun you're interesting you shoot it my way and it usually is pretty cool or fun you're interesting i appreciate getting actual stuff in the mail that's been a neat thing and i know some of you have supported in that more traditional way as well this feels so weird for me talking about how this all works and kind of the guts of it i know i've already said it like a hundred times i just i don't even want to talk about this kind of subject matter for two minutes without again pausing to say oh my goodness i'm grateful to all of you and you don't have to support some podcast on the internet at all you can ignore every last bit of this you can hang out with me for the next 40 years doing this going through as many books of the bible as we can get in before i fall over dead and you never have to kick in a penny and you never have to feel weird about any of that it's just the reality is that a bunch of you have decided that you do want to kick in on a podcast you don't have to kick in on because it is free you want to make a thing exist that otherwise i guess probably financially doesn't make a ton of sense and might not exist that is above and beyond that is ridiculous that is awesome of you and i wanted to get you up to speed on what the support stuff is looking like through the website and what it's looking like moving forward and hopefully address a bunch of the questions that many of you have sent me in just one conversation right here last note on all of that it says it on the website i think i've said it here before but i have very intentionally built what i do as a business it's an LLC it is not a non-profit and i come on you're smart you listen to the show i don't like taxes i don't like how governments generally use taxes i don't think being ethical is usually what governments are going for i don't think governments usually have kingdom values in view at the same time i'd rather just pay taxes on it and have people who don't like the churches and religion and christianity and ministry stuff are non-profit i just want to take away a reason to be mad my content on the internet has always been made with people who do not share the same convictions of me in mind i have this weird dream that we could hang out together that we could be friends that we could have good will that we could use vigorous language to disagree and not be threatened or weird that we could be forgiving with each other and so early on in my interneting i just decided i'm not going to put together a board i'm not going to do the non-profit thing i'm not going to make like an official ministry or anything i'm going to be a guy in my basement who makes content on youtube and in the podcasting world and who pays taxes on all of it and we'll just let that be what it is so that's how i have it built which means that if you kick into the program i can't give you any kind of you know special tax receipt that uh that works like if you gave money to a church or something because i am not a church but all of that to say that the listener support i mean you guys kicking in on the thing that's been the bread and butter of how this thing has worked we've tried a couple of sponsorships early on i just say notice stuff for the most part people do reach out a lot and that's very flattering but i don't know like most stuff just wouldn't be a good fit here it'd feel weird i guess or i don't know i've just said no to pretty much everything that's come in and in the back of my mind i've been thinking like well there's in my mind like two or three companies or organizations that i think would be a really good fit and if they ever come and ask i would definitely listen we could talk about it and one of those did come in and we started talking actually almost a year ago now just trying to feel it out and think through what it might look like and what might be right it's a 10-minute podcast i don't want to fill the thing up with a bunch of add stuff and promotions and so it's got to be it's got to be perfect if we're gonna do it it has to be a 100 percent this is like my favorite thing and i absolutely believe this could be something that could help you if i'm going to talk about it and so this isn't a sponsored episode or anything like that but we're pretty close to getting started with Samaritan ministries they do a christian health sharing network kind of thing and i might not even be using exactly the right language i've got all of my opinions and my experiences with them they came through for us big time when we had uh yeah i don't need to get into details but we had something pretty serious happen in our family with one of our kids about five years ago and um it was just an amazing experience with them and so i'm super glad that we're gonna try it out with Samaritan ministries i'll probably talk about what's going on with them once a week over the next couple of months and talk about them a couple times over on the youtube channel as well and that's a big thing it's a big concept and a different concept to a lot of people so i'm glad that it's the kind of thing that we can just kind of tease out over time but i'm really excited that they looked me up i'm really excited that we're gonna do this together they've been super super awesome as a fit for our family and so there'll be more about that and i'm excited to see where it goes on the whole i'm just going to continue to be unbelievably picky with those requests and just say no to most stuff because i think it's a very rare thing that something would be a good fit for you and i don't want to put stupid stuff in front of y'all i want to put good stuff in front of you but now we're way down the rabbit hole the point is all the way back to like 15 minutes ago which is weird in a podcast it's called the 10 minute bible hour to have anything that's 15 minutes ago but we do this time around going all the way back to like 15 minutes ago the point is i want to send you these books these empty notebooks with cool little art on the cover for each thing that we do if you're supporting in any way at all i'm going to do my very best to just find your address whether it be patreon planning center as we get that set up whether you kicked in something on paypal hopefully i don't miss anybody but the point is not like you got to go buy the thing it's just a way for me to say thanks for anybody who supports in any way and thank you for hearing me out on all of that stuff you might be thinking that was a lot of updating i bet that's all the updates no that's not all the updates i got more what else i want to talk about here new topic all the way back to the thing we were talking about the very very beginning of this conversation and that is that i want to organize the podcast knowing now that this is a long haul thing for me in a way that it can be a resource and more accessible and user-friendly to get into the back catalog and use old episodes for whatever reason you need to use them for is you're going through matthew or trying to remember something that we talked about the the current setup that i have it's built for that internet publishing waterfall right where you're just making new things like how twitter is built how would you even go back and scroll what twitter was in june of 2020 i mean it's chaos everything just goes over the waterfall you just keep publishing things and then it goes away that feed will never be the same well when you do daily stuff it takes on that feel and it takes quite a bit of work and in fact i've hired some people to help me to reform that into a long-term evergreen usable resource that is presented in a way that is easier to search to accomplish this i'm doing a few things one i'm going to restructure the website especially the podcast portion of the website the tmbh.com i think it's forward slash podcast very dramatically i don't know exactly what that's going to look like yet but i am paying someone who has better ideas than me to help me figure that out and i think they are going to do a sensational job stuff should be way more searchable the second thing that i want to do to make that work better is to put this content arranged in a new way over on youtube this is a big job i'm also going to hire someone to help me with this because i don't have time to pull it off on my own right now i'm leaning toward making a super edit of each of the chapters of Matthew and putting each of those chapters as a single video over on youtube with all kinds of search terms and with a clear reference down below if you're familiar with how youtube works there's your progress bar your scrolly bar down below in red and some of those videos are made in such a way where if you hover your mouse over the scrolly bar you'll see little tiny divisions along that timeline bar and if you hover your mouse over it in one of those blocks it'll tell you something about that block i want to design this in such a way that we take out the bumper material you know the intro the outro and we make the whole thing flow together as best as we can for all of say Matthew chapter five i mean how much was that 50 podcasts on Matthew chapter five or ever many we did all 50 of those in this scenario would be re-edited and lumped together in one video that'll just have some pretty pictures in the background or something it won't be like me talking into a mic it'll just be some filler images or something but the audio will flow pretty smoothly there and then we'll put in those divisions those markers for you so that you can jump over there hover your mouse if you're like well i i need something on Matthew five fifteen that's what i really want to know about well then you should be able to find that pretty quickly by just hovering your mouse over that until you find the part that you want you can move your playhead to that spot and let her rip and then hopefully i can put easily accessible links to all of the text of Matthew five or maybe just put the full text of Matthew five i might have to use a different translation there are some rules about that but i'll put the full text or something down in the description so you've got all of the stuff we're talking about biblically right there in front of you and you can more quickly buzz around now i don't want to change how we do the podcast to accommodate that that'll always be an after the fact thing over on youtube and we'll build that out as we have time to build that out this is a daily podcast that for the most part i mean 75 percent of the time i record the day of that's my brain if i got a cold that's my cold that day i read stuff i thought about things the night before i went down to my basement and i thought a little bit more they looked over a few texts but for the most part i tried to just turn on the microphone and be like all right rock and roll here we go and if i know a thing i try not to apologize for having known the thing in advance if i didn't know a thing i'm always happy to tell you i didn't know a thing the real-time aspect of this is very important to me and that's not going to go away the youtube thing is for the ever-greening the archiving of it so that you can get access to it so i think at some point hopefully still this year we'll get those mega edits done and we'll start uploading one video at time matthew one or matthew intro then matthew one matthew two matthew three and hopefully those will be real searchable and then you know right now if you go to google and you search like the 10 minute bible hour matthew 11 i don't know i don't think you're going to get much if you go and search that on spotify i don't think you're going to get much and i'd like for that to be something that you can even just use a simple search engine search and get connected with the right podcast the right way so that's one thing that we're going to do to make it more archivable more shareable more useful for what we've already done so you can go back and dip into that easy and conveniently and brush up on things stay sharp on things share things whatever you want to do with it the podcast youtube channel will be an afterthought that is not where my energy and my emphasis is going that's going to stay here but it is a resource that i want you to be aware of that should be coming down the pike pretty soon the next thing i want to do to make it all more user friendly and easier to search is we're going to go back through and update all of the show notes so that the first phrase in the show notes will show you the text we're talking about that day now starting around episode no no 600 650 we started doing this there used to be a thing when you published a podcast where you had a title section but then you could also enter a subtitle so i was like oh i'll just put the passage in the subtitle and it'll always be right there but within just a few months of me committing to that format i-tunes and other significant podcast providers and podcast apps that you listen to it on they all started to move away from that subtitle thing and gradually it started getting phased out of different apps and then all of a sudden i started hearing from you rightly saying i can't tell what passage we're on anymore it's not there and i don't know i still can't find a great solution for that the subtitle thing was wonderful for what we did it looks like the best solution is simply to put whatever passage we're talking about in the very first line of the description but i mean come on that's fine print and that can be a lot of work to look at so i want to get some elevating layers of searchability going visually in the podcast scroll feed as well so the next thing that we're going to do to make this all more searchable and more user-friendly for you is that we're going to do some rebranding stuff i am changing the name of my youtube channel from the 10-minute bible hour to just my name it's going to be matt wittman i've started sending out information about that to subscribers and folks over on that side of things when i started all of this the 10-minute bible hour was going to be a youtube channel where in about 10 minutes every week i would make a video and we'd go through books of the bible it was too slow it lost continuity we went through the book of act so that worked pretty well before the internet has gone since then it's just clear that wasn't the right format and as the numbers told me that and as you told me that and as i got a sense that there was more of an interest in doing this every day as part of a commute time or workout time or cleaning time or whatever i moved it over to the podcast is you are well aware well the podcast then really deserves the name because this really is the 10-minute bible hour the name as ridiculous as it sounds it makes sense here this delivers on what the name says whereas my youtube channel has really become more just a product of my curiosity my journey of faith stuff i want to know about the bible and church history and so there's tons of little one-off videos about all kinds of different things there's some really weighty stuff over on the youtube channel where i go to churches from other traditions and talk with people who dislike a lot of things about what i believe now that's too harsh they just disagree with things about what i believe and i disagree with things about what they believe but we agree on a ton of stuff and we compare notes and i try to keep those conversations light and fun because that's just on brand for me i like i told you earlier i have this dream that we could talk about these things in a way that isn't weird and fundamentalist that isn't weird and political and combative at every single turn but that also acknowledges the elephants in the room and has a laugh about it and speak candidly as men and women of action about these things and give each other the benefit of the doubt like i want to be the guy who can talk with absolutely anybody and make it work not by compromising everything or pretending we don't believe different things but by leaning into it just being a human with each other i think that can be how things are in the world again and i think it's a gift that the gospel and the bible and the values of the kingdom has to give society right now that society really really needs so they just don't know that they need it let alone where to find it so we just got to do it people who are bought into the kingdom thing and the kingdom values thing we just got to do that in front of people and we're gonna have opinions we're gonna have ideas we're gonna say those things might make each other uncomfortable but so what we power through it because we're people made in the image of god and we can know each other and we can like each other and we can figure things out and coexist even as we're in different places of wrestling through concepts that is a central dream of what i'm going for on the internet and when i go and do stuff like that on video it can be pretty serious and then i do other stuff over on that channel where i'm like you know it would be funny would be to go and look at a well-known story of the bible and really think about it with not kid brain but with like adult brain and revisit this that i haven't thought about since i was eight and then when i do that my dang this is actually really uncomfortable and has some strangely funny elements and then i want to put on weird armor costumes and beards and yell things into the camera and they have a laugh about it not to make fun of it but to grab each other by the shoulders and shake to think about the thing in a fresh and different way well that i mean that's so different than going and visiting a church and so that channel has just had so much going on i think my channel is very confusing to the youtube algorithm and so a rebrand over there to my own name just lifts so much pressure off of me in a way that's very hard to explain if this isn't what you do with your time and for a living but i felt like the name over there is the 10 minute bible hour and it just looms over me because i can't deliver on that over there there really isn't what that youtube channel is for anymore rather that youtube channel is a product of my curiosity my journey of faith wanting to advance stuff that i've said i have a dream about regarding how the internet could be and how talking about the stuff of god and theology and ideas could be and that's what i want to use that channel for whether it's goofing around and being funny or whether it's deadly serious important conversation and so rebranding it to my name it feels great it feels right and i have no idea what the implications of that will be in terms of people like it or watch any of it or if the machine learning algorithm at youtube gets it i don't know whatever i just want to feel peace with it and want to do things that i think are right and make sense as best as i can tell also i want to liberate the name the 10 minute bible hour eliminate that ambiguity and confusion that comes with having it on a youtube channel that doesn't do the 10 minute bible hour and i want to put it entirely on this podcast because i think this podcast has earned it so this will be the 10 minute bible hour moving forward i'm starting to call it probably the 10 minute bible hour podcast so people know what we're talking about but the youtube channel will be a different thing also that branding and that art which i think is awesome and super fun i've had that for a long time and i wanted to update it to be reflective of these changes and reflective of my commitment to this for the long haul and so we got some new stuff and it's going to start rolling out very very soon and i think it is ludicrously fun i talked forever with my good good friend Bethany who i've known for an age and who has internet traveled with me for a long time she's so gifted she's the gal who did that lulu the beaver book that i told you about that still if you haven't gone and got that thing i cannot recommend it enough she's got such a touch in terms of art and humanity and optimism and i was really hoping she would help me think through what things would look like moving forward and helping me to do it in a way that i could deliver on and not feel like i was setting myself up for you know pressures that i can't deliver on and so she jumped in with me on this rebranding project that sounds real corporate and formal but i don't know that's what we call it and she just made wonderful art that's reflective of what i want to do and the art is fun and funny and awesome and it means something and i'm super proud of it and i can't wait to roll it out and i will also tell you this in the course of talking she's like is there like any you know singular image that just sums up how you think about what you do is like lightning bolt it's a lightning bolt well let me finish my question it's a lightning bolt it's definitely a lightning bolt and the reason for that is i just i've always kind of thought of that image is going along with what we do here that it's fast it's it's meant to communicate that it's going to be quick that there's some power to it not like because of me good heavens we found out you know that but the bible holds itself out as being this really powerful thing that has huge implications but also i like the lightning bolt thing because it's like a lightning bolt boom and hit me i learned something and i feel like that happens to me constantly as we're doing this together and maybe you feel some of that as well so i like what a lightning bolt communicates in terms of growth and epiphany and connecting the dots and all of that stuff but then i was like but we're always talking about getting a book of the bible in your hip pocket spreading it out on the table understanding it for yourself you can do this and so i thought uh lightning bolt you can't handle that it's got to have a wrap on it and so some of the lightning bolts say this look like lightning bolts but we got a version of it that has like a grip so the idea is not enough you could pick this one up you can wield it it's got tremendous power beyond what really fully we can comprehend or totally control but you can get a grasp on it and you can handle this thing and so that's why the art looks the way it does i think it's super fun i hope you like it too if you don't like it i hope you still listen to the podcast anyway but the art has a ton of color coding and color cues that will be helpful as the the podcast evolves in keeping track of what book we're talking about so Matthew's going to get its own color throughout and then in big white letters on those thumbnails everything in say Matthew 26 is going to say in the time of the bible hour i think Matthew is maybe red i don't remember and in big white letters say Matthew 27 Matthew 26 Matthew 25 whatever chapter it is so that visually you can just whip through that and scroll real fast and buzz back through hundreds of episodes to quickly hone in on what part of the podcast you're looking for then you can look a little bit more carefully and look at the first line of the description to make sure you're getting to the right passage that you're curious about so you can recall things from the past that's what i'm thinking in terms of how we're going to reorganize that i got a few other ideas for how i might help make that more searchable in the future but that kind of brings you up to speed if you are still here that means that you've just done me the tremendous kindness of letting me take the better part of an hour of your time to talk about something that i think about all the time to think about something that i want to talk about with everybody all the time like i'm trying to solve this thing i really love doing it and i want to make it as awesome as possible and the people who are with me on it like they're great and and other people like i dude i'm i'm just trying to make your bros beef sandwich at rbs i don't i mean it's cool you have a podcast or whatever but you want that red ranch sauce on it or not i'm really bursting at the seams wanting to talk about it and so the the chance to just take the time that's needed to step aside and and fill you in i'll wear my heads at and what i'm thinking about stuff is is very meaningful thank you for indulging the not efficiency of this conversation and for caring about what we have cooking here and even if our pads only intersect briefly for a little chunk of time here it still just means so much and as i said earlier i'm just very very grateful for each and every one of you and i look forward to doing more of this that's a lot of bonus episode all right we'll wrap it up there i'm matt this is the 10 minute bible hour podcast sort of let's do this again soon you

 Boney Sephic Soda Boney Sephic Soda Hey my friends, it's Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and we're doing a bonus episode. Every now and then on Saturday when I want to talk about something other than the Book of Matthew, just grab a microphone and we process whatever. Well I got something I want to process with you and I'm going to warm up to it by giving you a little backstory. I started working on 10 Minute Bible Hour in November of 2014. I published the first thing on my YouTube channel in February of 15. I started the podcast in October of 19 and a bunch of you who are listening to this, we've known each other, we've been hanging out on the internet one way or another for that long. So this is a long time. And as all that has gone on and things have grown, more people have come around and hung out and been a part of this, I've found myself getting more and more emails, direct messages, Reddit messages, things like that, people reaching out from all over the place regarding their own church stuff, their own ministry that they're involved in. And usually what I hear from you is just a request for brainstorming together, for advice, for thinking it through. Because you, wherever you are, are wrestling with the exact same thing I'm wrestling with, which is okay. We believe there's a God behind all of this. We think there's a God behind the Bible. We think the Bible is reliable and we think that the Kingdom that we talk about as we go through the Book of Matthew on this podcast all the time is the truest, realest thing and the values of the Kingdom are beautiful and life-giving. And we see all of that beauty and we're trying to figure out how to articulate that in such a way that we could give it away to our friends and neighbors who maybe don't see that beauty yet. Maybe you don't believe anything or not Christians, they're not a part of any of this. Like, look, I think it's true. I hope I've been fully transparent in this, but to all of those of you who I just love having here are not Christians, but you care about the content, like, I totally hope you will be Christians someday. I think that would be awesome. Now, I have made peace with the reality that you might not come to the same conclusions as me. And I have more than made peace with Golly. I like you and I care about you wherever you land on these things. But look, I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that I think it's all true. And I think there's life behind it. And I hope you see the beauty in it. And I hope that at some point, straight up, you become Christians. Okay. All of that said, like a ton of us who are in the church and who are outside of the church in Christianity, we can all look at the world and see that things are in a weird, different, unprecedented place. Stuff changed big time. And the way that you would walk out into the great, wide world and just say stuff about God 30 years ago, 50 years ago, 75 years ago, like a lot of people are still trying to do it like that. But we look at it and we're like, it's just, I don't know, it's falling on deaf ears. It's something changed. And it's changed everywhere. Everybody's feeling all kinds of pressure because we live in this weird, unprecedented moment where the majority of historical, technological, social connectedness, progress has happened in like 20 years. It's so oddly imbalanced and all the people who came before us, they had time to work this stuff through. But the people who are occupying soil on planet earth right now, we're the guinea pigs, man. We're dealing with so much human responsibility to sift through what it's like for all of us to be in a room together. I mean, it's a digitally augmented connection that we have through the internet. But we're all in touch. We share news stories, we share global stories, we share global economy and we don't know what to do with that. Come on. That takes a long time to figure out. And so, yeah, the church is rattling a little bit, not going perfectly everywhere. People don't totally know what to do. But that matter though, the not church is rattling a little bit. All the institutions outside of Christianity, they don't know what to do either. It's hard because we don't know how to talk to each other yet and we haven't figured that out in the age of the internet. We're all kind of flirting with the idea of resorting to, yeah, I just forget the conversation. These people can't be reasoned with, we're just going to have to go with raw power to get things in line. I hope we don't give into that darker impulse, but come on, we've all been tempted by it. And by all, I mean, like all of us have been tempted by it. It's a difficult time. And so, as I hear from people who are trying to figure out what to do with the church and as I've been hearing from you over the years and years that I've been doing this internet stuff, one, I love the questions that I'm getting because they're the right questions and they're the ones I'm asking to. How do we make our church work? How do we say this in a way, live this in a way, execute this in a way that instead of just being slavishly loyal to some systems and structures we used to do is instead crafted around, I don't know, like God and the Bible and also an empathy to the people we'd like to see the beauty in this. You're asking the right questions. But thing number two about all that I'm hearing from you is that I'm frustrated that I've lacked the bandwidth to do anything about that. And as part, I have not been able to be very helpful because of all this other stuff I'm doing for years of running a church while doing this on the side. Eventually, because of you, this grew to the point where I had to pick. And so I was like, well, I've done church for a long time. That was awesome. I'm going to do this internet thing full time now. So I do. But I have so much that I've put on myself that I'm trying to tackle every day that I just feel like I haven't been able to give a fair shake. To the right and logical questions that you've been asking. Well, I gained some things out with some of my friends who are in the same boat and see in the playing field the same way. And a while back, we decided that we wanted to put together a thing that until now is sort of operated in the background of all that's going on. But for the last several months, we've been working on a thing called eyes up. Eyes up is just a catch all ministry side to what we've been doing. And so we've been working on every side to what we do that is meant to set us up to better respond to all that comes out of 10 minute Bible hour. Or at least that's where it's starting to respond to all of the questions that come in via email and so forth. The requests for help with church or ideas or brainstorming session. Or what do we do with this? And so we hired a guy. The guy we hired is Aaron Utect, my buddy who's been around this channel. He's worked on it for a really long time. And Aaron has started chipping away at making a thing that would enable us to, and by us, I mean particularly Aaron, to take the values and the tone and the idea of what we do here on 10 minute Bible hour. And game it out with those of you who are asking for help in terms of what you're doing with whatever ministry, kingdom stuff you have going on in your world. And we're hitting the publish button on that really this month, the website as you hear this will be up. It's pretty simple. But it's just our little nonprofit eyes up. How can we help you starting point website? You're going to see two things on there. If you go to the website, which I'm linking down below in the show notes one, you're going to see button that says something effective. One help with your church thing. You can click the button, you can shoot us a note, we're going to see if there's anything that we might be able to do to be helpful or just some ideas we could kick back and forth together. Additionally, there's another thing on there, which is a new podcast. This podcast is not my podcast, but I'm going to be a part of it. And I'd be really grateful if just to help get the thing off the ground and to encourage Aaron, if you would go over, subscribe to it, give it a listen, even if it's not perfectly suited for the questions you're asking and what you're doing. The podcast that we're running through eyes up, this ministry side of what we're doing here is called Good Ideas for Churches. Now, I'm going to be around it some I feature on the first episode of it. I will be there to game out some things here and there, but for the most part, Aaron is going to have his hands on the wheel of that. And what he's going to do is just go line up conversations with people who are asking the same questions you're asking. If you're leading a church working on ministry stuff, that being, how do we do this? How do we make this work in these weird unprecedented times? Aaron's just going to go have conversations with people who found something, anything that feels like a step forward in that regard, something that's effective in communicating the love of God and the reality of the values of the kingdom to people who aren't in it yet. Aaron is going to find conversations with people who have figured out ways to frame and set a tone in church that has been effective for people who are in that church. We have both been around to see all of the slick ideas that have come down the pike like, do this, all Christians, all churches should do this or that. This will make everything right. I don't believe in that. I don't think there is some singular solution that if you just buy this book and do what that guy says, now everything's going to work. I think more than ever, if you want to communicate the values of the kingdom, the message of the gospel, the reality of God to people you care about who aren't Christians and don't believe in that stuff yet. It's got to be a human. He's going to figure out an actual conversation with actual people and invest actual time. And so we're on the lookout for people who are figuring that out. Big churches, small churches, whatever. And as you go and you listen to this podcast, what you're going to find is some of the ideas that you hear. You're going to be like, dang. We could probably do that. That would make sense. That's progress. That's proactive doing something. I like that lady's idea. I like that dude's idea. Awesome. The podcast is designed for you to hear a good idea for churches or ministry or whatever. And then to adapt it as you need to and steal it, use it in your own context in a way that is effective. So the first episode of that good ideas for churches podcast is available now anywhere you get podcasts. It is also available through the Eyes Up website. It is also available linked below. That podcast is a joint venture. That sounds so formal of me in the 10 minute Bible hour as well as Eyes Up, which is its own entity designed to help churches and pastors and Christians figure out what to do in these strange unprecedented times. So in summary, thank you for being a part of 10 minute Bible hour. For however long you've been a part of it, I'm just going to keep doing all the stuff that I've been doing exactly as we've been doing it because I love it and we're going to keep going in this direction too. Thank you to everyone who's reached out to me over the years to say, we are kindred spirits. I am also trying to figure it out. We might not believe all the same things, but these times are weird. Do you have an opinion or any guidance that you might be able to offer here? You're awesome. You are a kindred spirit. Thank you. Three. I'm sorry. I have not been able to engage with all of that at the level I would like to. I've done my best and four because I have felt that pressure and so badly wanted to do something in response to what I am hearing back from you. We're doing this eyes up thing and I'm so excited to be getting that off the ground and to see where it goes and what it does. So as you reach out to me, I am going to nudge you in that direction because that's what we've built to help address those questions. And five, Aaron, you teched my buddy, my friend, my longtime colleague and a brilliant man who thinks hard about this stuff and who's head and personality are in the right place. He is going to have his hands on the wheel of this eyes up thing and he is eager with my backing and help to game things out with churches and leaders thinking through these big questions we're talking about right now. And finally, the biggest thing that is immediately available that he is doing to move that forward is this new joint venture podcast called good ideas for churches. And once again, I would be so very, very encouraged and grateful if you would just go look that up, hit subscribe on your podcast app, give a few episodes of shot, see if it's useful. If you know somebody, it would be useful to pass it along to them. I think Aaron's going to do a great job with that. And I personally am so excited to have something coming online that can better help with the good questions, the right questions that you've been asking. And I don't know exactly where all of that is going, but hey, it's off to a start and isn't that how everything works. At some point, you just got to push the go button and see what happens. So I'm amped about it. Thanks to all of you for being a part of the 10 minute Bible hour. We're just going to keep doing this stuff. Thanks in advance to all of you who were able to go and check out the new good ideas for churches podcast. That's a joint venture between what we're doing here and this new eyes up thing as well. I'm excited to see where all of it goes. All right, have a good one. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast more of Matthew on Monday. Come on now. You
