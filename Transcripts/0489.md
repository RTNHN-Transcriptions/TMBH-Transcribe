 They ever watch a TV show or movie or read a book where the author uses this narrative technique where they have a character, you're not quite sure what to make of. You're rooting for them. You feel like they could come around and they go and do something and you're like, ah, no, that's wrong. Don't do that. Your judgment is wrong on this point. It's like Alan Rickman's character in Harry Potter. Help me out. I know it's Snape. I'm not a Harry Potter guy. I just remember this character because I really like Alan Rickman. And you remember in those stories, I think I'm getting this right again, not a Harry Potter expert, but it seems like, man, this guy's redeemable. Come on, man, go and do the right thing. And then you see what he's doing. You get these little flashbacks and looks and you're like, ah, that's not good. That's not right. Bummer, that's not the decision I wanted that character to make. But in the end, big picture, you look at it and you're like, oh, I get it now. I see it. I see why that thing that looked dumb and not the way I wanted it to go actually was redemptive and the right call all along. I feel like that's the kind of thing we're running into in Matthew chapter 22 with this parable of the banquet on the surface. This just isn't a very good look. And I think it's okay for us to admit that that this king looks like he's punitive and it looks like he's in a foul mood after a really bad day and a bad start to his wedding feast. And then he behaves in a way that looks kind of judgy and mean and he throws a guy out over what, just not having nice enough clothes. Come on, man, that's crazy. But as we talked about in the last episode, I think as we look a little more closely at this and we break it down and we think about the cultural expectations and we think about the fact that this is a parable and who Jesus is talking to as he tells it, it starts to make more and more sense. And in retrospect, I think we look back and we're like, Oh, I get why the king did that. And so when we get to the end of chapter 22 and we're on the back end of this story about a king who had a wedding party for his son, the prince and all the fancy invitees refused to come when it was time for the wedding and some of them even killed the messenger. They so badly didn't want to go the wedding. And then the king goes and burns their city and punishes all of them. And then he comes back and he tells the servants, we're having a party one way or another. Go to the highways and byways, go to the place where the sidewalk ends, go to the street corners, get whoever you find there, good, bad, whatever. And let's do this thing and the wedding bank would has filled and it feels like it should end. But here we are on the back end of this thing. And instead what we get is this, but when a king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there was not wearing wedding clothes. And friend he asked, how did you get in here without wedding clothes? And the man was speechless. Then the king told the attendants, tie him hand and foot and throw him outside into the darkness where they'll be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are invited, but few are chosen. It's kind of funny that he has that guest be speechless. He doesn't try to justify himself. He doesn't try to explain anything because you remember one page earlier? I mean, if you wonder who he's talking about or what would pop to mind, I think it's right here. Remember the religious leaders who he's saying these parables to, they came to him and they're like, hey, when you get off, when you get the authority to do this? And Jesus is like, I'll ask you a question. If you answer me, I'll answer your question. What's the deal with John the Baptist where he get his authority? And they're too afraid to actually answer the question because they know they're in trouble either way. So they come back and they are effectively speechless. We don't know. It feels like this might be one of the few places where the parable isn't just a general point about the kingdom of heaven for all time, but the parable is kind of like a right now. Remember that conversation we just had like a second ago? Well, while you were standing there scrambling, I was standing over here composing a story in my brain that would demonstrate the absurdity and judgeability of your position. Maybe that's there. Maybe I'm reading between the lines, but I just think it's interesting that the guy doesn't offer a defense and by his speechlessness, he condemns himself. Now, at this point, some of you might be like, why are you making this so difficult, dude? The parable is very straightforward. We know what the king represents in all of these parables. We understand who is being talked to here. We understand the theme of judgment. We understand the theme of reversal and this being opened up to a much larger group than the religious leadership or this narrow way that they had created at the time and the cipher to the whole parable brother. It's like right there at the very end in verse 14. Why are you just talking about verse 14? You there to have a point. Because maybe it is just as simple as this. The whole parable ends just saying for many are invited, but few are chosen. For many are invited, but few are chosen. Yeah, that's it. So what does that mean? Why is that there? I did some digging around on that because it sounded like a buzz phrase to me, but I didn't see any cross-reference in any of my study Bibles or anything. It turns out that the reason I'm not saying that cross-reference is because it is a reference to a disputed part of the Old Testament that Catholics, Orthodox, and some Protestants would say, yeah, that's Bible, especially if you ask them a little bit later in the game. Jerome who translated the Vulgate did not think that this part was Bible, but a whole lot of Christians at this point do. Evangelicals, reformed types would say, no, most Protestants would lump this book into a different chunk of Bible, but this is what's called the Deutero canon or the apocryphal books. There's one in there in particular called Second Ezra's. Now, look, depending on what tradition you're looking at, you'll see this title presented differently. Some people break this apocalypse of Ezra down into different divisions like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th. I'm not going to lie to you. It can be kind of difficult to sort through what goes where. But in what I believe would be the new revised standard version rendering of this book attributed to Ezra in 2nd Ezra or 2nd Ezra's 8th, 3, there's a reference that sounds kind of like what Jesus is saying here. Many have been created, but only a few shall be saved. Now, it doesn't sound like Jesus is giving a direct quote here. And even if he did, well, things outside the Bible are referenced and quoted all the time. So I don't think it will settle for anyone. The ultimate and final debate of those few disputed parts of the Old Testament or what to do with it. And that really isn't my point in bringing it up. It looks like he's at least referencing a concept or a turn of a phrase in common with this book attributed to Ezra in the Apocrypha or Deutero canon or he is referencing maybe this text itself. Now, there's a whole lot of judgment being spelled out in 2nd Ezra's and I'm not going to unpack that entire book or work through what to do with it. But I think it is fair and worth noting that it looks like Jesus is alluding to some sort of apocalyptic concept that the original audience would have had in mind here, whether it's from this text or not, that would say that this banquet that's going to happen, that apparently people knew was coming. Nobody disputed that this banquet was coming, that this banquet that's representative of the end of things and like you get together in a celebration and a high five for the glory of God, for the glory of the king, that at this banquet, there's going to be a lot of invitation, but in keeping with this theme of the remnant and with the few responding properly to the authority of God, these few faithful narrow is the way in keeping with all of those themes, those motifs. It looks like not everybody is going to say yes to the invitation. Now, here's the payoff. If we read that as being a common assumption that the original audience had, and I think that can be defended by flipping back to Matthew chapter 8 and listening to the way Jesus talks to this outsider, this Gentile centurion there, and he says to the people who are following him, mostly who would have been Jewish, he says, I tell you the truth, I've not found anyone in Israel with such great faith talking about this Roman soldier, this Gentile. I say to you that many will come from the East and West and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Remember this? In the kingdom of heaven. Okay. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Whoa. Oh my goodness. That idea connects so very, very much with what we're seeing here. Everybody's invited. It sounds like the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were definitely invited early in the game, maybe in a way you could even say they were invited first, but then somebody shows up in this parable and they're not wearing the wedding clothes that they're supposed to be wearing that identify them as true guests of the king, people who are in league with the king and who have assumed to write posture before the king, and they get thrown out into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. That's exactly the language Jesus uses in Matthew 22. And it's exactly the language he uses back here in Matthew 8 in this little passage. It's just kind of slid by, but the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside of the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Who are the people who get thrown into the darkness? Well, apparently some of them are the subjects of the king who wouldn't come to the banquet. And apparently some of them are people who did come to the banquet, but they weren't really ever in kind of like two parables earlier in chapter 21 of Matthew where one kid said, I'm not going to work and then did and the other kid said, I'm going to work and then didn't. Likewise, some of the people who said they would come to the banquet didn't show up. And some of the people who never would have even thought to say they'd go to the banquet. So I guess we're not going did show up. In other words, the kingdom is not universal. I think we can say that safely coming away from this passage. Universalism just isn't what's being described here. Look, I might like it. If that's what it said, that might make me feel better. But it isn't what's being said. What's described is a king who is righteous and right to judge and who apparently has the ability to admit flawed broken screwed up people into his perfect presence, metaphorically expressed in the form of this wedding banquet. He can invite them into that using his own riches, his own wealth, his own glory, clothing them, if you will, in his righteousness. But if he is truly the owner of righteousness and it's his to judge and his to extend grace, then well, it looks like some judgment is indeed going to occur. And if that were my job, I would screw it up and be terrible. And I'm not prepared to draw those lines on behalf of God because I just don't know. But this is what the text says that God is perfect and flawless and right in his judgments. And that some of this response to him is found woefully wanting and results in rejection, either in ways that look kind of innocuous or in ways that look obviously bad and horrible. Either way, he's judge. A whole lot of people are invited, but few are chosen. This can get a little bit dizzying. It is so much stuff. Parables are rich and the fact that we're 22 chapters in now and we're starting to see all of these payoffs that maybe if we didn't take our time, we wouldn't notice. It's exciting. It's really fun to connect these dots, but it also means that from time to time, we got to do some big overview. What does this all mean and where are we kind of conversations? And I think that's what we're due for tomorrow. I noticed that a handful of you jumped into support the program at patreon.com slash the tmbh podcast over the last week or so here. I just want to tell you that that is so uplifting and encouraging. Thanks for doing that. That puts a spring in my step that provides energy because the reason we're able to do this and we're able to muster the time and the energy to make it happen is because of those of you who support the show that way. No expectation that everybody has to do that or anything, but it's just awesome that some of you are able to do it. Thank you so very much. Thanks to those of you who don't do that, which is also cool. I'm just so very, very grateful that we get to do this together and we're going to do more manana. A map is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Do this again soon.
