 If all people on their 13th birthday were given three time travel tokens, you only got to time travel three times. It's a return trip. You know, you get to go there and then you got to come back. What would you use your three on? I've thought it through, but I'm going to give you one of my three right now. I would use it to go and see the famed white city that happened at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. It was this city of largely fake marble that was like the advent of the modern world. It was this beautiful, incredible, majestic human accomplishment that was in an age of elegance and romance and more people than lived in America at the time, went to this World's Fair. It's not like you think of World's Fair as now. It was an unbelievable moment and I would have loved to have seen the values and the ethics and the productivity and the language and the style and the feel of that moment to walk those streets, to walk under electric street lamps for one of the first times in American history to see this Greek Roman style city rising in front of Lake Michigan with this beautiful elaborate lagoon and all of these various buildings that pay homage to the great cultures around the world. It is magical to me and enchanting. I feel a nostalgia and a sadness for a time I never saw and never experienced. So it'd be cool if the time travel tokens happened, but you know, I'm not holding my breath. Here's a deal. When we get to the beginning of Matthew chapter five, we are hearing about a kingdom that takes my breath away in the same way. I'm hearing about something that solves every problem and fixes everything that stresses me out and it's hard about the world. And even though I don't have time travel tokens, this is one that the text holds out as being accessible. You can go to there. There can come to you, but it's a little bit tricky to see and it's a little bit tricky to understand. And the question of what this kingdom is, is a central theme of the gospel of Matthew. So again, we pick it up with Jesus opening words. It says, now when Jesus saw the crowds or he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and he sat down. That's why we call it the Sermon on the Mount. And sat down and his disciples came to him and he began to teach them saying key thing to note as we move on into the rest of this text, his original directed key audience here is the disciples. So he's teaching people who he's already called, who have already bought in, who would want to know what this kingdom is about. The crowds are there and they're listening in, but you got to understand that. If I'm talking to my three kids, even though I know a bunch of other people are listening, I'm still framing that all up for the kids. If a graduation speaker is talking to the graduates, he might be aware that there's a whole room full of people, but he's still talking to the graduates and you have to get those multiple layers of audience to properly interpret what's going on with a passage like this. So first and foremost, teaching his disciples who no doubt would really like to understand what all this is about. He starts by saying, blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. That is the worst opening line to starting a new religion I have ever heard. In fact, there are a whole lot of people today who agree with me that that's the worst way to start a religion ever and they've just had terrible luck trying to imitate it. And so instead they have found ways to just flip around at the whole message of Jesus and the Bible to be blessed are the rich in spirit and just the straight up rich because they will get richer because that richness is a result of a blessing of God and a demonstration of how much they donated to my personal private ministry thing. This prosperity gospel thing, it's a plague, my friends. It is, I'm not going to call any names. I want to pick any fights with anybody, but look, it's the opposite of the kingdom values that we're reading about here. I'm not saying that Jesus' plan for everybody is eternal poverty. In fact, life abundantly is what Jesus describes, but the idea that somehow the kingdom of God is a cosmic transaction where we put in a certain amount and then there are just ludicrous interest payouts that happen. And so you tie their donate to something and then God gives you more stuff. It's nonsense. It's not what we're going to see here at all. And the opening line shoots that down, blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Well, poor in spirit means more than just being in a position of physical need, though I certainly think that is encapsulated in Jesus' meaning here. Poor in spirit would have had the same connotations of the original audiences that I just threw out your poor in spirit, probably poor in money, you're rich in spirit. It's because you're getting something right. But it's also kind of a state of being. And as we get a little bit more sense as to what the kingdom is about, where a central value is that Jesus is king and everyone else assumes a right posture of submission to that king and dependence on that king, something that we really see spelled out when we get into the Lord's prayer. You know, our father in heaven, how would be your name? I mean, you provide everything. You're in charge of justice and mercy. You're in charge of protecting us in basic provision, whatever you want, it be done. I mean, this is, this is face down on the ground kind of stuff that we're being told as a right position before a king, this good and this holy and well, you know what, in the values of the kingdom, that porn is in spirit, that humility, that realizing that we are in this position of need and that the king is enormously effective and powerful and in charge of everything. Well, I guess that would be a blessing as we get to understand this kingdom better. And apparently, this means that somehow that porn is associated with inheriting this kingdom of heaven. So I don't know. I mean, the natural place my brain goes is to that third raiders of the lost Ark. I think we talked about that a while back when I was talking about Jordan and the city of Petra. But in that third one, remember he has to figure out how he's going to pass that one test. It's like, as I was you say, like the penitent man will pass. He figures out like, Oh, I have to hit my knees and then like some giant axe or something come swinging through that would have taken off his head. I'm not sure that's exactly what this is driving at, but I thought it was cool. They were referencing this concept that really to enter into the kingdom is an active humility. I think of Jesus teachings on wealth, this idea that it's it's harder for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven than it is for a camel to go through the eye of the needle, break all of that stuff down another time. Or even in the history of church architecture, I picture the tiny little door on the, I think it's a church in a tivity, isn't it? I think it's the church of the nativity in Bethlehem in Palestine. They got this little tiny door and it's like the humble door or something they call it. You got to squish all down to get through there. You must assume a penitent posture before the king incarnate. So the simple idea here right up front is that value number one in the kingdom is you're not the king in the kingdom. Your agenda isn't the agenda of the kingdom. What you want doesn't set the pace of the kingdom. And on its face, that sounds awful. I want stuff where I set the agenda, but the problem is everybody has a different agenda. And it's kind of like I made a video way back when when I took the risk of talking about things like this, selling my YouTube channel where I was like, Hey, what if everybody got to make just one law? And the idea here is that it sounds great. Like everybody being like, Yeah, I think everybody should be free or whatever. But you know, there's just is one thing that I don't like. I don't like it when the people drink this or eat that or take this or do this or make these kinds of contracts or have these kind of relationships. And it sounds really open minded to be like, I believe in freedom except this one thing. But when you head that up, you know, like 300 plus million people in my country who all just want one thing that they get to make a law that's enforced through, you know, imprisonment or fines over. Well, then you have a horrifying fascist police state. If you do that, and at some point you got to let go this impulse, this imagined right to control other people. That's what I was arguing. You can think I'm wrong on that if you want to. You may have a point, but here the same thing applies. If everybody comes to the kingdom with just one thing that we're rich in spirit about and we're like, I want to set just this one part of the agenda. Well, it's not going to work. Everybody gets one of those things. You're going to have a cluttered mess. No, there's one agenda as we see this kingdom being laid out. And I think the original audience would have got it. And I think we're capable of getting it. And that is the agenda of the king full stop. He says how it is. And then we participate in that. And in that state of pornis and spirit, rejecting our imagined right to be in charge, accepting the idea of the true king and the true kingdom, accepting a posture of humility and being aware of our state of enormous need that is more thoroughly fleshed out once again by the language of the Lord's prayer coming up in the next chapter. You assume that posture, not only you are a lot more likable around other people, but at that point, it would seem that you are now prepared to embrace the rest of this upside down kingdom and weird currency that we see described moving forward in the document. Last thing, I've been telling you about my buddy Shane. We live in the same neck of the woods. We met through some school stuff and he's doing this Psalms project. It's just all the Psalms put to music. It's really good. And I realized I've been describing it to you, but it's music. I could just play some of it for you. So I'm going to play some of his stuff on the way out the door. You can get it in the show notes, Spotify, Google it, whatever. Just go look it up. You'll love it. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast more on these beatitudes and the sermon on the mount coming up next time. The king will rejoice in your strength. Oh Lord, and in your salvation he finds his joy. For you've given him all he asked you for. You've welcomed him home with your favorite Lord. You lavishing with every blessing. Set a crown of gold on his head. He cried out and you granted life forever. The exulted is strength. Oh my God, we will sing and place your power. We will sing and place your power. The story is great in your victory. You've clothed him and splendered in majesty. He joys in your presence. He trusts in you through your perfect love. He will not be moved. Your hand will grasp all your enemies. You'll seize the ones who hate you and banish them with your fire. Oh, come to me. The exulted is strength. Oh my God, we will sing and place your power. We will sing and place your power. The lost spring you will now end. And their descendants from the sons of men for evil they plan against you. Father, but it's a blood faken up perform. You'll make them flee in fear. You're in your, you're in your, you're in rose after face cells. The exulted, the exulted is you overcome. The exulted is strength. Oh my God, we will sing and place your power. We will sing and place. We exulted in strength. Oh my God, we will sing and place your power. We will sing and place your power. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And we will sing and place your power. We will sing and place the exulted in strength. Oh my God, we will sing and place your power. We will sing of your great power. We will sing and place your power. Thank you.
