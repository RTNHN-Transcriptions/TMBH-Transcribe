 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. If you've been hanging out with me for a while on the internet, then you know that I've been getting into tennis. I'm not particularly like good at it per se, but I'm getting better. I practice a lot and I play against really good players. And what I'm learning is that, like when I was outside looking in tennis, you just whack the ball super hard at other people and then inexplicably like every fourth or fifth time you whack it real hard. They just can't get it and you're the winner, I guess. I mean, that's what I gleaned from watching it on TV. Well, it turns out it's super complicated and there's all kinds of strategy and people play different kinds of games and they hit the ball differently and the ball presents differently depending on how you hit it. And there are some people who my modest little tennis game matches up against really well and they're probably better athletes than me, better at tennis than me, but my thing it just works against their thing than their other people whose game is just kryptonite to me. And I look at them like, I should be able to win this. Why are you better? Tries me crazy. What I'm discovering is that I need to develop another version of my game to beat some of these players, like a different swing, a different strategy for how I generally like to dissect the point and take a point. But right now, I haven't figured out how to do it yet. And so I'm doing this thing where I just go down with the ship every single time. And then I see this isn't going to work, but this is my game. These are the things that I do and I'm going to do them even if they don't work on you. And then I lose and I'm like, well, I lost doing my thing because I just have the one game. Likewise, throughout the book of Matthew, we have seen that the people who are opposed to Jesus just have one game and they keep doing the same thing and hitting the same metaphorical balls again and again and again and all the way down to the bitter end in Matthew 28 right here within 10 verses of when the whole thing wraps up, we leave them in our last look in on the enemies of Jesus. And we see that they are continuing to do the exact same thing that they've done all along because it's the only game they got. And that's not my opinion. That's what Jesus said in chapter 23. And it's really kind of what John said all the way back in chapter three. But all of that in a minute, I haven't read the verse yet. Here's the verse. Well, it's a lot of verses. So we're going to start in verse 11. But before that, do you remember Jesus is dead and there's an earthquake and some dead people come back to life and the curtain tears in two. And then the religious leaders are like, no, no, we're going to put a seal on that tomb in a Roman guard over there because we don't want any kind of nonsense propaganda. We're going to make sure he stays dead. Weird that they would even be worried about something happening. And then three days later, based on a Eastern Mediterranean rendering of how you count three days, these ladies who were unflinching and never back down and their game was consistent throughout. It was just show up and be there and support Jesus and follow him around. Well, they're still playing their game too. So they do the same thing they've done all along, except this time around their hope and their faith become sight because there's some glowing angel guy sitting on the tomb and the stones rolled away and earthquake feelings. And he's like, you can go in there and look, I know who you're looking for. He's not there. He's alive. Go and look to see where he was laying and they're like, okay, I guess you're right. And then the angel comes out and he's like, go and tell the disciples that Jesus is no longer dead and that he's going to meet with them in Galilee. And they're like, Oh, okay, Doki. And they go to head out and then there's Jesus. And he says greetings and they fall at his feet and they worship him in the gesture of the physical posture that we see throughout the gospels from what it is to assume a right posture before the king. And Jesus let them do it for a minute. Cause I mean, it's important. And then Jesus is like, Hey, I'm calling them brothers. Like we don't even have to have a reckoning because they all abandoned me and sold me out. Don't go tell them. I'm real mad about things. Just go tell my brothers. Go to Galilee. There they will see me. Like we're just moving forward. That's the plan. So now we know that Jesus game plan is the same as it's been from the beginning values of the kingdom, forgiveness, turn the other cheek. Eye on the ball in terms of the development, the establishment of the kingdom. That's where his head is at. This is how he's acted the whole time. Well, here's how these guys have acted the whole time. They only got one game. Like I only got one tennis game. Verse 11, while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests, everything that happened. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money telling them you are to say, quote, his disciples came during the night and stole them away while we were asleep. If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble. So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulating among the Jews to this very day. There is a ton to break down here about the details of making such a report, the legal risks and ramifications for these guards to make such a report. I mean, that must have been a crazy sum of money. It's not like when Judas went and was like, I'll sell out Jesus for some money. And then he came in with a super wrong bid and they were muted. They're like, yeah, seriously, that's all it's going to cost us. Okay. And Judas, no doubt immediate. It was like, dang it. So much more idiot. It's why you always get everything wrong, Judas. It's why nobody's ever going to love you. Dang it. But okay. I mean, give me the money over here. These guards, they were much better negotiators, apparently than Judas because they got a bucket of money. They backed up the Brinks truck here. And I think they would have had to as we'll look at probably next time around in order to buy the guards word on this because the expense to them was probably very significant to go and circulate the report. This is what I want to look at. The game plan thing, like we were talking about the beginning. You just got the one game and you just keep doing the same thing. You got one way you hit the ball, keep hitting the ball that way. Your football team, all you know how to do is run between the tackles. So all you do is run between the tackles. And even if you're losing, like we're going to stick to what we do well. What do these guys do? Well, they lie, man. That's your superpower. That's their playbook. The playbook, it has one page and then it just, it's all alphabetized. So you just flip to the one page, it's L and then you look at the instructions on there, it's just a lie. It just says the word lie. And then they do that. And again, this isn't my evaluation though. No, it is my evaluation. It just happens to be one that is in common with Jesus of Nazareth, the, you risen Christ in Messiah's evaluation. My evaluation is coming from what I'm seeing in Matthew, what I'm seeing in the other gospels, the gospel authors are holding out to these guys as being completely willing to dispense with integrity over little things and over big things. They can't be trusted with little. They can't be trusted with much. They will use dishonest lying motives or rather pretenses, even with stuff like spiritual disciplines. They'll go out on the street corner and pray big, bold things with their flowy outfits because they want everybody to know how good they are on Matthew 23. Jesus effectively says that is a lie. And he's saying as much in Matthew six as well when we get introduced to the proper posture to assume when one is praying, they lie about the details of things that happened. They smarm about how to interpret things. They frame pitches in certain ways. They are selective in what part of the story they tell and what part they neglect. They're selective in what they get all excited about and focus on. And they're selective about what burdens, what rules they enforce. They don't worry so much about the ones that would maybe make them into hypocrites, but they worry very much about the ones that might cut into their funding at their little religious club. And finally, we get to chapter 23 and Jesus has been calling out. I mean, he's been pushing back on this thing all along. It's not just that we're on different sides politically. And you guys like the one side. And so you argue for it and frame the pitches that way, no matter what. And I'm Jesus and I like the other party. So I frame the pitches that way. No, no, no, no, no, no. Jesus holds it out like this. The thrust of chapter 23, which I encourage you to go back and read or listen to the episodes on. It's just a verbal beat down in front of everybody. It's a verbal beat down of the religious elite and the people that everybody's supposed to be looking up to. And what he effectively is charging them with is being blind guides who are guilty of not just their own crimes, but they are the spiritual inheritors, the spiritual intellectual ethical moral descendants of all the people who killed the prophets who came before all that blood, blood from righteous able to Zechariah spilled there on the way to the altar. All of that is on you guys. That's what Jesus is saying. As we talked about a couple of days ago, I don't even remember why we flashed back to John the Baptist stuff in chapter three. Oh, I remember why we flashed back to it because it was a flashback episodes right there in the name Whitman. Come on. It's on your first day being a Bible podcast about things super embarrassing. But what does John the Baptist say? The religious leaders walk up and he knows who they are. He knows their game. He knows their playbook. They have one game. It's lie. They call them. Brute of vipers right off the bat. He doesn't even let them get a lie out. They just walk up and he says, instead of like, Oh, I'm so lucky you guys are here. Maybe I can get you on my side. Maybe I can use the ring of power that you wield to defeat my enemies to. Nope. He's not even tempted by the power. He just leads with, Hey, you brute of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming wrath and not everybody who's there getting baptized and like singing songs and dreamy eyed youth pastor with a guitar and stuff out there. Strahman and John the Baptist, the big big wig. It all feels good and it's great. And then he's like ruining somebody's baptism by calling the religious leaders a Brute of vipers. But that's what happens. He just starts yelling at him, produce fruit and keeping with repentance. In other words, what you're doing is the exact wrong way. Demonstrate that you are now going the exact opposite way. And don't you guys be coming back here saying like, no, you know, ethnically we have some unique standing or special dispensation or sweetheart deal from God. We're like kind of grandfathered in. We can actually be horrible. Uh, don't think that way at all. The axe is already at the root of the tree. God can raise up children out of rocks if he wants to this ethnic thing. There's a new family of faith being made. And what God wants as we see spelled out from Jesus and the sermon on the Mount, which happens only that many pages later, once your heart, those are the values of the kingdom. That's the right posture before the king. Jesus is just following up on that in Matthew 23 and stating as a blanket judgment in a way that only the king can judge. He's proclaiming you are purveyors of a failed playbook. You know one thing and it's how to lie. And the liar is the one who is the enemy of the kingdom. And so as we get down to the home stretch here in Matthew 28, one of the questions that's still lingering out there is how are these character arcs going to complete? Well, the character arc of Jesus looks to be pretty close to complete. He showed up. He was right about stuff. He spoke with one who had authority, then he backed all of that up and he picked some guys out through a bunch of energy at preparing them for what was to come and forgiving them a role. He's going to have to, you know, not that big a deal, get executed by professional executioners and come back to life three days later, but he even delivered on that. So the character arc is complete. Jesus has trained up his disciples. He defeated death. He is bridged the gap between God and man. Pretty great job on his part. It's really not truly a character arc at all because he's immutable. That's how the Bible holds him out. He doesn't really change or need to change, but the Pharisees. Are they going to grow? Are they going to figure it out? Are they going to tear up the old crappy playbook? Are they going to ride this thing all the way down? We know the one thing only might not get the results, but this is what we do and we're going to do it all the way to the end. Just like Matt Whitman with his garbage tennis game refuses to change anything and just takes the L, but he hits that one ball the way he wanted to hit it. Well, what we're discovering is, yeah, they're choosing the latter. They're going to ride it all the way down with the one play they know and they're going to throw money at a situation to buy truth just like they did in the kangaroo court that happened a couple chapters earlier that sent Jesus to the cross. Same game plan, same play. Nothing has changed. They are at the end who they were at the beginning, but I feel empathy for them because I think I would have been on their side. It's really fun to imagine I would have been team Jesus and like, oh, yeah, I see it. I get it. I know how the things are, but I know how wired. I think odds are I would have missed on this one and I would have been on their team and I would have found ways to talk myself into some weird justification of what they were doing and why it was so important and good and greater good. Just like this is what we got to do. So look, we're supposed to read this and see that they're wrong and we're supposed to see why they're wrong and we're supposed to see that confronted with undeniable truth. They just doubled down with more lies, but I'm not sure we're necessarily supposed to get on our high horse. And imagine that we're totally better than them. Thankfully, we're talking about it. Jesus here went to the cross and built a whole kingdom with a set of values predicated on forgiveness, even for people who get it really, really wrong. I think that's a good thing. All right. That's probably plenty for today. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. Bye.
