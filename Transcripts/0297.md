 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Thank you for hanging out with me. I'm excited because today we're going to start talking about my favorite parable of all the parables of Jesus. This is the parable of the wheat and the tears. This one more than any other, and I'm not even sure that's necessarily an indicator of me being a person with a healthy mind. But for me, this is the most formative parable of all of the parables. This shapes more than any other how I do life, how I think about other people. It affects my ethic of how I interact with a larger world that doesn't believe the same things that I do. It affects my ethic of the role of the church in society, the state in society, the individual in society. But maybe the implications aren't that far reaching, but over the next couple of days, you can decide if I'm stretching this a little bit and do with it what you need to do with this. Again, this is the parable of the wheat and the tears. It starts in Matthew chapter 13, verse 24. You will recall that we are now into the third of the five great speeches that Matthew is organizing his account of Jesus' life around. The first one is a sermon on the Mount. It is a straight through the front door explanation of the values of the kingdom. That one runs from Matthew 5 to Matthew 7. People hear him teach. They're like, I was really impressive, but can you back it up? Then he does a bunch of miracles to back it up. Now it seems like the ball of the kingdom, which was introduced in detail as a concept in the sermon on the Mount, is ready to really start rolling downhill. And so the next big speech is Matthew chapter 10, where Jesus commissions his inner circle of disciples to go on this big open world quest and do kingdom-y things and model kingdom-y values and see if people sign up for kingdom-y stuff. The results seem to be middling. And after chapter 10, we see tension ratcheting as the religious establishment and the squishy middle crowds who aren't quite sure what to make of Jesus are starting to push back and then angrily starting to push back and it has even started to turn murderous. So now we get into chapter 13, the third big speech, the kingdom parables discourse. And Jesus is no longer going straight through the front door in his teaching to the crowds. Now he's teaching in parables and we look at the one about the sewer who indiscriminately throws seeds all over the place and lands on four different types of soil. Only one of those four different types of soil has the seeds work out. The disciples are like, hey, why are we teaching in parables? Then Jesus explains that pointing back to the prophet Isaiah. Then he explains what the parable of the sewer is all about. And then we get to Matthew 13, 24. Here we go. Jesus told them another parable. The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone is sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. When the wheat sprouted up and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. The owner's servant came to him and said, sir, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Where did the weeds come from then? An enemy did this. He, the master replied, the servants asked him, ah, do you want us to go and pull them up? No, he, the master answered because while you're pulling up the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. But both grow together and tell the harvest. At that time, I will tell the harvesters first collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn. All right. Quick note right up front here, like the parable of the sewer, which was split into two parts with the parable being told and some other stuff happens. And then we get Jesus explanation. So the parable of the wheat and the weeds is split up. We've got a couple of little mini parables. One about a mustard seed, one about some yeast. And we're going to look at those before we get to Jesus interpretation of his own parable. So for now, we're just going to start with this parable by breaking down the raw materials, which I think is more than fascinating enough to keep our attention here today. So on the top level, it looks like this story is a zooming in of the last story onto the one type of soil that was good. The first three types of soil have failed to produce a harvest, but now we're looking closely at the one where things work out. The four types of soil we get back there. I mean, what does it really represent? Does it represent four different types of individuals? Well, kind of. Does it represent the church? Oh, no, it can't represent that because otherwise, why would it need to encounter the message already? Now, the church would be the place where that seed has already taken root. So the four types of soil represent the world. And three of the four types of the soil don't work out in the larger world. But one of the four types of soil in the larger world works out. Likewise here, Jesus explanation that we get looking a little bit ahead, very specifically dictates that the field here in the parable of the wheat and the tears is also the world. So it's not crazy to say we're going from a very wide parable to deals with everything down to, okay, moving on from the three parts that didn't catch on to the one, we're just zooming in here. We'll move ahead with that assumption for the moment. So once again, we're getting the language of the kingdom of heaven. The kingdom of heaven is like so we are still on the same task that we were in the sermon on the mount. We're learning about the kingdom, but now we're learning about it through a story and through imagery. So it's like a guy who sewed good seed in his field. Okay, that no twist there. That's common enough. But while everyone was sleeping, the enemy came and sewed weeds among the wheat and went away, which for people like probably most of you and me sounds mean and like an inconvenience. But to people who do agriculture for a living, you're like, Oh my goodness, that some dude came and at the height of malice tried to wreck somebody else's entire business, entire hereditary family business. They tried to discredit this family by what they planted in there. They tried to ruin an entire harvest. I don't know how much there was crop insurance back in these days. I'm not aware of that being a thing. This would have been an expression of the height of hatred. I want your family to starve. I want your family to be impoverished. I want everything to be taken from you. I want your family name erased from history. Everything would have been invested for many families, at least in this harvest. And even today, those of you who do agriculture for a living, you know a horrible harvest can put you in a very precarious situation very quickly. But here it's not hail. It's not bad government policy. It's not a fire locus or something. Someone did this on purpose to do damage. And we catch on to this when we start to see the wheat pop up, but then also the weeds are in there and we're like, Hey, wait a minute, what's this? That's not how we planted the field. What's that doing there? And then they figure out in this horrifying moment, it's everywhere. And the servants who I wonder if they were meant to sound a lot like Peter here or if they just happened to sound like impetuous Peter, they come up to the master and they hit him with a little bit of passive aggressiveness here. The servants came up to him and said, sir, didn't you so good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from? Maybe I'm reading into it. Maybe that was totally innocent. And this is their job and they toil at it all day. And maybe they're not afraid that they're going to be punished by the master and maybe they're not trying to blame shift, but it looks like a little bit of CYA to me as they drop this, but then the master looks at it and he knows exactly what happened. He knows dang well, he used the right kind of seed and he knows dang well that someone is trying to do damage. And he says definitively an enemy did this. Samitage. He knows that something that screwed up only happens as a result of malice. And now the servants are like, Oh, well, we're not getting in trouble for it. Let's get angry with the master and go do something to help here. Well, we got a problem and what we should do with that problem is charge right in and rip things up. I'm telling you, I really do think the voice of the servants is supposed to remind us of the voice of Peter. That could be wrong. The servants asked him, do you want us to go and pull them up? And then the master, of course, like, no, we're not going to do that. And you heard me read the thing before because if we rip on the one thing, we're going to rip out the roots of the other thing. We'll destroy the whole harvest, but we have a plan when it's all done. If we're attentive and we're patient, we will sort this thing out later. So the servants look at the situation and they're like, this is an untended mess. The only thing to do is to go in with the broad sort of aggressiveness right now. And the master is like, a long view. This is going to work out. I have a plan for that. Be patient. I suppose the tone the servants are taking could also be likened to James and John, the sons of thunder, the two brothers that wanted to call down fireballs from heaven to consume a Samaritan village when they didn't sign up to follow Jesus a little bit later on. I suppose the servants tone really could be indicative of the disciples in general who are constantly throughout the book of Matthew and even more so throughout the book of Luke and Acts, begging for Jesus to do the reckoning thing. They're like, look at the world as a mess. We need to sort some things out right now. And we want your judgment right now. And we will explore further how precarious it is to demand things like that from Jesus to demand things like that from God. So about halfway through our rough breakdown of the uninterpreted parable here tomorrow, we're going to talk about whether this story would ring credible to the original audience or whether this would sound like a completely far fetched made up scenario. And I think we're in a lot of fun unpacking that. So parable of the wheat and weeds. We got one more on the front end, then we'll do the mustard seed and the yeast thing. And then we'll go and look at the interpretation of the parable of the wheat and the weeds after that. Look, it's like an outline. We're having fun together. So once of you jumped in over the weekend after I mentioned the Patreon thing and decided to support the program, even if that's only for a little while. Hey, thank you. That was a huge encouragement over the weekend. That means a ton to me. And just for those of you who are maybe new to that side of things, patreon.com is a website where creators like me can go and set up this little webpage and this little account thing. And then listeners like you can go and jump in. It's really easy to sign up and you can set it up to kick in like a buck, two bucks, five bucks per week of podcasts. That's how we have it set up. So I go in, I click a little button Sunday night, Monday morning and that charges the patrons for that week, those next five episodes of podcast. We do four of those a month. And if we come upon a month where there are five Mondays in a given month, then we don't charge for that week and we do a fun little side quest and I take a week off and it's great for everybody. So that's how it works. Thank you so much. That's that. Thanks for the rest of you for hearing me out on my patreon spiel. That support really is a thing that makes this thing go. So I cannot say thank you enough. More wheat and weeds next time around. I'm Matt W. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
