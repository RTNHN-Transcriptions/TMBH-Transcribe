 Hey, what if there was a sign that just appeared over your head on any given day. You didn't know when it was going to pop up. But it's like this neon like hologram style sign. And what it says as it floats around above your head is the truth about you. It boils down who you are and what you do, your competencies, whatever to the most basic defining level of your essence. And it just broadcasts it in bright lights to everybody. And maybe you don't know exactly when it's going to crop up there. But at some point it's going to crop up there. Would you walk around all day feeling like I cannot wait for that sign to pop up? It's going to be so flattering when the all-seeing eye looks deep into my soul and determines what I truly am. And then puts that succinctly on a sign that floats around above my head. Everybody's going to love it. They're finally going to see me for the genius I am and for the high character, high value person I am. And they're going to be sorry they underestimated me. Or would you walk around with a sense of dread that when that thing popped up over your head, you would be absolutely laid bare and humiliated in front of everyone. Would you live in fear of the day your sign pops up? Because finally you're going to be exposed for what you are and all of the things that you're insecure about and that you worry about and that you feel like you kind of have to put on a brave face and a good show to impress people with that all of that stuff is finally going to be just put out there and people will finally see you for who you really are. Well, look, I think there are some people who would respond to this exercise being like, hmm, that's interesting. I just genuinely don't care. I'm very comfortable in my own skin. I'm trying to get things right. I am what I am. Awesome. That kind of person exists and I hugely respect that kind of person. I do not think such a response is necessarily born out of pride. I think however, the majority of people would dread such an appearance of such a sign that says what you really are because I think in this day and age, a majority of people feel massive pressure to perform, to look like something, to match up to the ridiculous standards of social media, to be up to speed on whatever the latest moral fad is so that you can say it just the right way. But deep down, I think most people know they're just saying a bunch of stuff to try to get along and they're just winging it and trying to get through most days. We're coming back to that idea of the sign appearing above our head that lays bare what we truly are. But before we get back to that, I want to talk about an incident in which somebody literally had a sign put above their head that was meant to lay them bare to mock them to point out the absurdity of their own internal monologue and sense of identity to make a laugh out of them and an example out of them in front of everyone. And of course, we're in Matthew 27. And of course, it's Jesus of Nazareth. And of course, you probably already know what the sign says. Verse 35 says, when they crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots and sitting down, they kept watch over him there above his head. They placed the written charge against him. This is Jesus, the king of the Jews. That's his placard. That's what he gets his entire existence boiled down by a few half wits to this very simple phrase and then stapled above his head while he's hanging there, basically naked, bleeding out, struggling for breath, lifted up in front of everybody. And of course, the joke of the sign is the juxtaposition, right? It's like a sign that says like, you know, so and so king of the whoever's. Well, that's one of those statements of regal title and style, king of the andals and the first men, breaker of chains, all of those kinds of things that you hear tagged on to the the royal titles of people who want everyone to know their awesomeness and have some sort of herald who proclaims in advance exactly who it is that you're about to get an audience with. This sounds like that. And so taken out of context, you might see a sign like that and be like, Oh, wow, this is somebody really important. But in context, stapled above the head of a guy hung out the way we're talking about right here, you go, Oh, okay, I get it. That's in just that is meant to be a jab a mockery. All right, clearly I see what we're doing because that isn't how kings look. Kings are the ones who ordered people executed like this. They're not the ones who get executed like this. Okay. All right, I see what we're doing. But as we've seen so many times in the last few chapters as we've been working our way toward the cross, every single one of these mockeries is accidentally speaking truth. And it's kind of wild the way this works out because throughout history, you've got several of these moments where somebody tries to make fun of somebody else. And then the party being mocked is like, I actually kind of like it. I'm keeping that like the Jesuits, the Jesuits are a Catholic order that made it their business to go and try to articulate a very Catholic understanding of the gospel to the world as part of the counter reformation starting in the mid 16th century. And they called themselves the society of Jesus and people were like, come on. Everything is of Jesus. It's a little light organ isn't it? And they were like, Oh, yeah, we're leaning into that. And so as I understand it, the term Jesuit is them saying, we'll take your criticism in your mockery. And if that's what we're getting wrong, really, in and into it, the idea of a Yankee or even the little song Yankee Doodle wasn't that meant to be a mockery of the people who were opposed to the crown during the American Revolution. And Americans were like, yeah, we love it. Let's lean into that. And then now you got a baseball team. Well, now you got a baseball team turns out that baseball team has had that name for a while at this point, but it's again a way of leaning into the insult. Well, here, perhaps most of all, you look at any depiction of the crucifixion and you're going to see this sign as part of that depiction. Usually you'll see the Latin abbreviation, I N R I. And I understand how that could be a little bit confusing because I mean, it doesn't Jesus start with the J King of the Jews. And like, of course, we're talking about a different language. And in this case, it's a Latin. So what you see in is a Zeus Nazareneous Rex, a Udayorum or Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. I'm a hundred percent positive. I didn't say that perfectly, but that's the gist. And so what you get here is an attempt to put the sign over somebody's head and be like, all right, you are laid bare. You are boiled down to this. You are distilled to this single thing. And the single thing you are distilled to is an absolute joke, except it turns out that it's absolutely right. And unwittingly, every time people try to mock Jesus or mock God in the gospel of Matthew, the text holds it out as boomeranging on the mocker and as demonstrating that God can't be mocked, that God is sovereign over all of these seemingly random or uncontrollable events that are chained together to form up this story. And that in itself is a pretty compelling subtext. But there's another level to this subtext that takes us to a place that we don't often go. And that's all the way back to us and the idea of a sign being over our heads and the fear that most people would feel over being rightly distilled down to one thing by an entirely accurate, all-seeing eye that peers into your soul and then posts a succinct description of who you truly actually are. But as we're having this conversation about the sign over Jesus head being accurate, I think it's worth bouncing back to Matthew chapter five and remembering that the values of the kingdom are beautiful and the values of the kingdom are not really what people intrinsically usually are, usually were something very, very different than that. But the kingdom sounds great in Matthew five. And people no doubt, like, man, I would like to sign up for such a kingdom. And then Jesus was like, well, the only way to have access is to have a righteousness that exceeds that of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And nobody can do that because the Pharisees and Sadducees get to write their own rules and so implicit in what Jesus says there and then what we see from Jesus in the interim between chapter five and where we're at in 27 is this idea that there is a righteousness that gains you admittance to this kingdom, but it's the righteousness of Christ. You can't achieve it. You can't do it even if you could write the rules. You can't do it. But somehow there's this ongoing suggestion that the righteousness of God could be handed off to you. And if we're reading Matthew carefully and, oh, if we read the rest of the Bible as well, it becomes very, very evident that this humiliating incident with the robe and the crown of thorns and the mocking sign stapled above his head with this incident that we're reading about in Matthew chapter 27, the nature of your hypothetical sign is changed. If somebody is in Christ, they're a new creation. The old is gone and the new is come. That is the nature of the sign is changed. The text then is holding out this life theological concept that one who is in Christ goes from being an imposter who tries to keep up certain appearances, but ultimately will fail in those endeavors because of human limitations. You go from being that to being one whose truest essence, truest identity, sense of standing, sense of belonging is defined entirely by the righteousness of the king. Your sign goes from being one that would say very ugly things that you can't really totally solve through human effort to saying beautiful things because of the one who is hanging under his own sign right now here in the passage we're looking at. We're nowhere near done exploring that concept and we're nowhere near done with the details of the crucifixion more on this next time around. And Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
