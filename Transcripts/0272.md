 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Do you remember the phase when all the rage with the toys was to take multiple toys that were separate action figures and then you could put them together into one bigger action figure? I mean, the obvious example here would be Voltron where you take all the lions and you cram them together and the lions form a giant robot with a sword. I mean, I guess it's kind of what the power Rangers was about too, but Transformers had a whole bunch of these. You could combine the constructicons. What were they called? I can't remember, but whatever the case, they formed a Devastator and then they made a whole bunch of other little ones like that. It was just really fun to try to collect all of those, but the deal was you'd get the first one out of the package and you'd take it apart and you'd be like, okay, well, obviously that's a cement mixer that turns into an individual robot. And that's cool and all. But even before you got the other members of the team, you'd be sitting there fidgeting with it like, how does this work? Is that like a shoulder? How are you going to connect to the bigger thing? You just couldn't see it until you got all the toys and put it together. And that was like abundantly clear. Oh, look, it makes a big gigantic robot that was usually actually incredibly flimsy, but still awesome in the heart of an 80s or 90s kid. That is pretty much what the four servant songs of Isaiah are like. Isaiah, of course, is the biggest, most significant prophet of the Old Testament. He gets quoted left and right in the gospel of Matthew and the other gospels as well. It's in Isaiah that we get all of this language about hope that the broken, scattered people of Israel and all the promises of God to redeem everything that was ruined and busted up about the world through the broken, scattered descendants of Abraham of Israel, that all of that stuff was still in play. There was still this glimmer of hope, this little tiny baby green little plant that was just sticking up like when baby Groot was starting to come back to life and it's maybe it's going to grow up into a big gigantic Groot again. And everything is going to be wonderful. And the people in the original audience at the time that Jesus is on the scene, they've got this cultural memory and longing for the promises that are held out in Isaiah, but so much history has happened. And there's this sense of frustration and, well, if it's not going to happen miraculously, we'll do it ourselves. Or, well, maybe we need to behave way, way better to get God to get on the ball and get this thing rolling again. There's all of these weird reactions to this little glimmer of hope that we get from Isaiah, but Jesus comes along, the gospel writers come along and they take the whole Isaiah thing and are like, all right, there's a lot of things that a lot of y'all are doing with this promise and this glimmer of hope. But I'm telling you, all of this is fulfilled in Jesus. All of this was pointing to this culminating moment in the redemptive plan of God. All of those arcs of promises and prophecies in the Old Testament are lobbed forward into history by the prophets, but they converge in Jesus. All four gospel writers want to make that clear. And Jesus wants to make that clear. And Luke, very famously in the early going has Jesus unrolling the scroll of the prophet Isaiah, and he reads, yes, I'm stalling to get to the passage. In Luke 4 verse 18, he reads, the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he's anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Then he rolls up the scroll and everyone's like, why did you read that one? And then he leans back down to the mic is like, yeah, today that scripture is fulfilled in your hearing. And then boom, everybody's all worked up and frantic. It's a gigantic claim that all of the debate around the most important prophet ever, the prophet where all of this messianic stuff is coming from, that all of that debate is settled in Jesus. Watch me, he's saying, it's resolved in me. There are a ton of different styles of promises in Isaiah, but there's this one particular style of messianic promise in Isaiah that the fancy theology Bible folks call the servant songs of Isaiah. And in Matthew chapter 12, after back to back Sabbath controversies and after Jesus withdraws from the Pharisees who want to murder him, Matthew says that all of that action, all of Jesus behavior and style and how he treats people and what he's doing is to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah. And so in Matthew 12, 18, Matthew is quoting from Isaiah 42 verses one through four. Here's my servant whom I've chosen. Okay. In the gun, Matthew is saying Jesus is the servant of the servant songs of Isaiah. Here's my servant whom I've chosen, the one I love in whom I delight, I'll put my spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nations. He will not quarrel or cry out. No one will hear his voice in the streets of bruised read. He will not break and a smoldering wick. He will not snuff out till he leads justice to victory. In his name, the nations will put their hope to the passing observer. That might sound like nothing. There are some words from long ago that are poetic and vague and Matthew latched on to those to try and convince his audience of something to the more attentive observer, maybe like you and me. We might say, Oh, wow. Okay. That's a prophecy. It's an arc, a single arc lobbed forward in history by an Old Testament prophet that now seems to land on Jesus, but to the people who were most invested in the messianic redemptive prophecies of the Old Testament, that being the original audience, the Jews, the people who were looking for a messiah, this claim right here in Matthew would have been gigantic. Because by invoking Isaiah 42, Matthew isn't just saying this is a fulfillment of this one prophecy. He's saying Jesus is the fulfillment of the entire well known, cherished servant motif of the prophet Isaiah. Further, Matthew is therefore making the claim that the content of all four of Isaiah's servant songs everywhere this character comes up in Isaiah apply to Jesus. So we've looked carefully at one yesterday, Isaiah 42. This is what God to the Lord says. He who created the heavens and stretch them out to spread out the earth and all that comes out of it who gives birth to its people and life to those who walk on it. I, the Lord have called you in righteousness. I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and make you to be a covenant for the people, a light for the Gentiles to open your eyes that are blind to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon, those who sit in darkness. I am the Lord. That is my name. I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols. See the former things have taken place and new things I declare before they spring into being I announce them to you. And some people think this is part of it too here. Verse 10 of Isaiah 42, sing to the Lord in new song, his praise from the ends of the earth. So while a lot of people in the original audience would have thought, well, the servant is Israel. Or at least we could have been the servant. They probably were at this point discouraged that the bad behavior of their ancestors messed with their relationship, their covenant with God. And now maybe somehow they aren't going to be the servant that God uses, the servant that passes the test that all humans struggle with, the servant that rises above that and is used to be a light to the nations. I think everybody was starting to agree that if that did mean Israel, it didn't mean it anymore, or a lot of work would have to be done to restore Israel to being God's servant. Again, Jesus and the gospel authors and a thing that we'll talk about a little bit later on, a firm that no, this is no longer a thing that is in reference to a king of Israel or Israel itself. It's a prediction of a future king on whom God's spirit will rest, who will open the eyes of the blind, who will free the captives from prison and release from the dungeon, those who sit in darkness. And of course, if you've been hanging out with me going through Matthew here, you know that those things are happening and that Jesus is very conscious of the fact that those awesome things are in direct fulfillment of the servant song of Isaiah 42. So that is the first servant song. The second one is Isaiah 49 one through 13. Here's a highlight that points to Jesus. This is what the Lord says, verse seven, the Redeemer and the Holy One of Israel to him who was despised and abhorred by the nations to the servant of rulers. Kings will see you rise up, princes will see you bow down because of the Lord who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you in this song, the servant reflects the glory of God. He makes things better for the oppressed people and God affirms what he's doing, even as the servant feels great emotional burden for the work that he's having to do. And once again, that language drawn from all the way back in Genesis in the Abrahamic covenant about this servant being a light beyond the Jews to the Gentiles is here in this second servant song in Isaiah 49 six. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth. That theme just ain't quitting. Isaiah 50, the very next chapter picks up on a bunch of these same themes, picking it up in verse six. It goes like this. I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard. I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting because the sovereign Lord helped me. I will not be disgraced. Therefore, I have set my face like flint and I know I will not be put to shame. He who vindicates me is near who then will bring charges against me. Let us face each other. Who is my accuser? Let him confront me. It's the sovereign Lord who helps me. Who is he that will condemn me? That's what you have here is a leaning in to the description of the suffering of the servant, including details about the abuse that he takes, but also the resilience or rather, I should say, resolve of the servant to set his face like flint. I mean, the pivot point in the gospel of Luke is Jesus set his face resolutely toward Jerusalem. And from there on, it's downhill toward the cross. And that's very intentional language on the part of Luke to draw on this point right here in that servant song. Finally, the fourth song occurs from the end of Isaiah 52 starting in verse 13 through all of Isaiah 53. And the language here is stuff that you've definitely heard and that we see sprinkled around the New Testament as well. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering like one from whom men hide their faces. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought his peace was upon him and by his wounds, we are healed. We all like sheep have gone astray. That's a familiar line from the New Testament as well. Each of us is turned to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is silent. So he did not open his mouth by oppression and judgment he was taken away and who can speak of his descendants for his life was cut off from the land of the living for the transgression of my people. He was stricken. You're smart. You've been around Bible stuff. You see what's going on here. The first three servant songs are maybe a little vague, maybe a little bit debatable, even though the opening one is quoted specifically by Matthew as a fulfillment of what Jesus was doing. But when you get to the final servant song, it's like, I don't know who else that could be. I don't know what else that could be. The theological language surrounding the servant laying down his life, carrying the suffering and iniquity and the burden of everybody else. I mean, the substitutionary language is Jesus. It's the cross, at least as it is reported to us by the gospel authors, and at least as far as we know the actions and ideas of Jesus from those sources vary overtly. Everything lines up to say that Jesus is the fulfillment of the servant songs of the Old Testament. Every now and then we get the pleasure of doing a deep dive into the Old Testament like this in order to be able to move forward with more clarity in the New Testament. So we'll inch ahead with Matthew chapter 12 now having this servant stuff song in our hip pocket to clarify what happens moving forward. Thanks for gaming it out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
