 Hey everybody, I'm Matt, it's the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and let me tell you one of the things that I think is the most challenging to the modern mind when we encounter the teachings of Jesus and the Bible. That would be the idea of resurrection, life after death. I think at some visceral, emotional, intuitive level, it makes a ton of sense. It just feels like the whole you thing, me thing, family, love, consciousness, dreams, ambitions, story, it just doesn't feel like we are like the other things that are in the world. It feels like people are unique. It feels like there should be something more than just what happens between you drawing your first breath and drawing your last. It feels like there is a significance and nobility to us that transcends this lifespan or just this physical plane. Intuitively, I think a lot of people go there and they can't shake this feeling of something more. We go with our modernistic formula process oriented brains. We just want to understand like physically, how would that happen though? How would there be something beyond the natural and the physical and the known? How could people go on that gets pretty tricky? Where do they go? What would that place look like? Can I drive there? Can I go to it? Is it like ghosts? How does resurrection occur? And so understandably, at a moment in human history where we highly value that, which is repeatable and testable, a claim like what happens when you die, which means the end of your five senses and you kind of need those five senses to repeat things and test things. What happens after you die? A question like that is going to make our compass spin like just holding the magnet up to the thing and just the whole thing goes bonkers and haywire and like, ah, that's a catch 22. It defeats the whole thing. It's untestable because in order to test it, you have to no longer have access to the five tools that we use to test things. I don't know. It doesn't work. I'm skeptical of it. I don't like it. And so I think this question of resurrection is one that in a very new way, we wrestle with with this internal turmoil that I think most people feel all politics aside, all tweets aside, all external showiness aside. I think most people feel this friction even if we don't know how to articulate it. But even though in a post scientific revolution world, we're going to wrestle with that in a new and unique way, it doesn't mean that people of the past didn't wrestle with this question of what happens after you die. Is there some sort of resurrection of the dead? Is there a next? On the Old Testament, it certainly looks like there was an understanding that there was. That's kind of odd because you will hear from time to time people say like, no, that's a brand new idea that Jesus introduced. The Old Testament doesn't really teach that. I don't know about that. We're going to go look at that here in just a minute. I think the Old Testament does acknowledge that life is bigger than first breath to last breath and that there is something that happens after. But all of that is to say that when we're looking at the time of Jesus, there were apparently people who were like, yeah, I don't know if that's really what our scriptures have taught in the past that we have eternal life. And there were some people who were like hardcore. No, there is definitely nothing after there is no resurrection of the dead. If we had more of the things the Sadducees wrote down in the first place, maybe we would know more about what that thing actually is. But that was the Sadducee position, the Pharisees as well as the Christians who agreed on this thing, they know there was life after death. Paul thought there was life after death. Jesus clearly thought there was life after death. That lady's kid from Maine who was dead that we hear about in Luke, he believed in resurrection. Lazarus, he believed in resurrection. I mean, those guys probably part of the reason that they believed in it was because of how they died and then came back to life. But maybe he's like, ah, that's cheating. Even if so, there is still this majority position that something happens after and that that's something that happens after is tied to what you do and how you align and function in this life. And it's ultimately tied to the work of God who is the being who transcends the physical world and the eternal. Here's a quick sampling of some of the Old Testament stuff that I think is a little bit more smoking gun in terms of demonstrating that this religion came with a notion of life after death in the Old Testament. Psalm 139 8, if I go up to the heavens, you are there. Some translations just have that as straight up heaven. If I make my bed in the depths or shield depending on the version, you are there. So the idea is that there's some sort of consciousness and awareness that transcends this lifetime. Granted, that's articulated poetically, but still seems to be speaking of it as though it's a truism. Psalm 49 deals with this as well. We'll pick it up in verse 7. That'll make it coherent. No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him. The ransom for a life is costly. No payment is ever enough that he should live on forever and not see decay. Maybe like, I don't know. The first one is kind of convincing that Psalm 49 one sounds like that could just be like a poetic turn of a phrase, but then you skip ahead just a couple verses to Psalm 49 15 and it says this. God will redeem my life from the grave. He will surely take me to himself. We're starting to get a picture here that maybe no, this is in fact intentional. Daniel 12 one through three hits on the same stuff says at that time, Michael, the great prince who protects your people will arise. I mean, just if you don't know what that means, don't worry about it. There's so much to unpack with Daniel, but just keep listening. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time, your people, everyone whose name is found written in the book will be delivered. Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. I don't know. That's starting to seem pretty overt. Isaiah 26 19 says, but your dead will live. Their bodies will rise. You who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy. Your do is like the do of the morning. The earth will give birth to her dead. It sounds like these people believed in the notion of resurrection. It sounds like this idea was baked into was hardwired into Old Testament theology and the stuff that they regarded as scripture that was directly from God. Just a quick aside, look, I don't want to waste a bunch of your time with me taking tons of time flipping pages of the Bible. So I do cut that out so you don't have to listen to all of me trying to remember exactly where something was. And that could give the false impression that I like know like everything about where the Bible is and all the things like just to be clear, I'm looking it up. I remember some of this off the top of my head, but a bunch of this other stuff. I'm like, Oh my goodness, what was that thing? Somebody said something one time. It's like in Sunday school when I was nine. If I type like 15 words that sort of remind me of it, maybe I'll find it. Oh yeah, that's there. And so I think it's important just in support of one of the points of this whole 10 minute Bible hour podcast exercise that we do together to make sure you understand that. What I want to accomplish in part with this thing is to make it clear that like you can do this. You're perfectly competent and interpreting a text. You're perfectly qualified to think about the Bible. The Bible wants to be understood. You can understand it. This is all work that you can do. So please do not take my decision to cut out 20 seconds of Googling or trying to remember what passage that one was. Like some kind of illusion that you have to know the Bible with that kind of rapid recall to make the connections and piece the thing together. I just don't think you want to listen to the dead air. So I cut all of that out. But like you, I got to look all of this stuff up and I'm learning and thinking about it too. Okay. Thank you for indulging that side note. My point of all of this is that the Sadducean position on eternal life and the resurrection of the dead was a minority position that was not in keeping with the first century Jewish understanding or the majority first century Jewish understanding of the scriptures. People would have looked at that and said, now this points to there being something that is bigger about the soul, something that is bigger that God does in the life of the person who honors him or believes in him. Obviously they had a lot of questions about how exactly that transaction worked because Jesus felt the need to clarify it and speak to it and fulfill it and complete it. We've talked about that a whole bunch of different places. So the Sadducees held this minority position and it is a minority position that the bulk of the Old Testament undercuts the bulk of the Old Testament indicates life after death. There's resurrection, but where the Sadducees got a little bit of traction was by arguing that in the first five books, which if you recall from our conversation yesterday, they were decidedly uniquely loyal to that it's not as pronounced there that you could debate some of the language used there as to the eternal fate of the soul. Tomorrow what we got to do is look at where the conversation is in the New Testament. What is Jesus saying? What does the rest of Matthew say about resurrection? Maybe we've just taken it for granted that resurrection is automatic and that's just kind of flowing by. So we're going to go back and review some stuff that Jesus said and consider how Jesus position stacks up against the Sadducean position. Thank you as always for being willing to indulge me on this deep dive background stuff. I really think it helps us get the passages we're trying to understand well way way better by the time we do the background stuff and actually get to that. So high five you were awesome. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast more on this money on.
