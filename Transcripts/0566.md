 Yeah, we've been on one of those brutally awkward car rides where a few of you are piled in there and maybe your uncle Walter is driving and things are going fine. You're all stuck in the vehicle like there's no getting out of it. You're all going to the same destination. You got no alternative. You're going to be together for a while and uncle Walter starts going on and on about whatever and most of the conversation is fine, but he's got some opinions and ideas and reads on the world. And because there's nowhere to escape to, you all just have to listen to it. And then it's over and you're like, huh, and you try to move forward, but there's still all that stuff uncle Walter said. There's still hanging out there. And at that point, really, whatever happens next, whether it's changing the subject or diving deeper into it or arguing, they're trying to have an awkward laugh to make it go away. There's nothing you can do. All in response to whatever that big thing was that just got said and likewise, except for the part where it would be likening Jesus to a ridiculous uncle who says ridiculous things in cars, almost likewise, we have this world changing set of remarks that Jesus makes on this journey that he's on with the disciples. They're with them. They're in all the way. I mean, there's nowhere else for them to go. Who else has the words of life? They are riding this thing out to the very end, even though he's already told them a bunch of times, like, I want to get killed. It's going to be these people who do it and you raise back to life. It's a lot for them. But again, they're all in the wood sided station wagon together going down this road together and Jesus is driving and he just made some remarks and they are remarks that I think the disciples probably found to be troubling because those remarks harken back to some of the darkest worst cultural, ethnic, religious memories of their people. That being, as we've discussed for the last couple of weeks, the destruction. The first temple and the overwhelming disappointment of the second temple. After Nebuchadnezzar came in with his army in the early sixth century BC from Babylon, he left Jerusalem desolate. The temple is ripped apart. The place is overgrown within just a few decades with trees and shrubs and plants and I am legend looking landscape all over Jerusalem by the time the exiles returned under Cyrus the Great and even the oft used phrase abomination that leads to desolation, which we will unpack more as we go along, seems to be a reference to such evil and wickedness in and around the house of God that it leads to something that is evocative of that historical desolation, that image that's in the mind of the Jewish people about what happened to their holy city and to the temple where God dwelt among them at one point. Nobody wants to go back to that. That's the point. That's the point. So like Uncle Walter in the station wagon, Jesus makes some remarks that there's just no getting passed. Somehow you got to engage with it and because they're so weighty, whatever you say next is an engagement with it. But unlike Uncle Walter, it's not an insane old person rant. He's saying something that is absolutely true and from God and that is a prophetic warning in the style of the Old Testament major and minor prophets against the people who are in the process of rejecting him. So with all of that history from the last couple of weeks now in our hip pocket, we're a little bit caught up to the original audience now. We go back to the very end of Matthew chapter 23, the end of the seven pronouncements of woe against the religious leaders. But we're going to look at this with our eyes wide open now, having done the work to put ourselves in the shoes of the disciples who are there to hear it as well with this great big history. We've looked at Jesus says, Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who killed the prophets and stoned those who sent you how often I've longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you weren't willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate for I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Now look, I got a figure at this point, the disciples are still hoping that there's some way out of this thing. It's like when you see good quality writing in a TV show or a book and there's obvious foreshadowing that something terrible is going to befall a character who you love and need to see on screen, they're like the heartbeat of the whole story. And you're like, I know good writing and the natural flow and theme and irrefutable arcs of this story are taking us in this direction and it has to go there. But you're hoping against hope that it'll steer in a little different way. There's got to be some way. I think that's where the disciples are at. And I also think when Jesus starts saying this stuff about the temple, maybe deep down they're like, oh, no, come on. There's just stuff that you can't say that. I had somebody helping me out with a thumbnail on a video a while back, very talented, very smart person and they're good at art and I was just picking their brain. They're like, oh, I got something for you. I got carried away. I put some work into it. Here you go. Just for fun. And I looked at it and was like, oh, wow, no, that is never going to work. Yes. I would hook people and make them very interested, but also to a huge percentage of Christians. That would be straight up blasphemy. And my buddy didn't know and I didn't use the thumbnail. But I think I had my finger on the pulse well enough to know that if I trot that out, I'm just declaring war for no reason whatsoever. And I think the disciples are feeling some of that emotion here as well. Like they're looking for the narrative off ramp. So maybe Jesus doesn't have to die and he can be regarded as king and they can be vindicated as being early adopters of the thing that was actually true and real and right. And everybody else can apologize and they can have their families back and mom and dad will get back together and everything will be absolutely fine again. But then Jesus starts saying this stuff and the language is really not even that veiled. He burned that bridge. Homer Simpson with a lighter style with the Pharisees and religious leaders and then he caps it off, turning a phrase that clearly in the parlance of this day and age means the destruction of the temple and Jerusalem left desolate in a way that would remind everyone of what happened after Nebuchadnezzar's invasion. And in this moment, I think they realize, this ship is sailed. What do we do? What do we do? But it's just hanging out there and they're all in the metaphorical station wagon together and somebody's got to do something or say something. And so then this is what you get. Jesus left the temple as chapter 24 and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to these buildings before I read the next part. If I'm reading it right this way and there are a few different ways to read it that we're going to explore, but if I'm reading it right this way, then they're like, oh, like look at how happy that is. It could be as pity if anything happened to it because it's great. Like there's got to be another way. Like maybe you didn't mean to say all the things that you were just saying. Maybe you're not familiar with all of the stories and how that's going to register with everybody. Like it's that's not going to work. You're not going to be vindicated that way. People are going to be mad. The polls are not going to turn in your favor. So just look how pretty this is. Let's just think about that for a minute. Maybe we could do some happy things in the station wagon. And then Jesus replies as we looked at a few weeks back in verse two, do you see all these things? And the disciples are like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't double down. Don't say it again. Don't say it again. Don't say it again. I tell you the truth. Not one stone here will be left on another. Everyone will be thrown down. This is the equivalent of when the angry Twitter mob comes after whoever is supposed to be in trouble on this given week. And that person instead of falling all over themselves to apologize and say how very, very sorry they are to people who don't even actually hold the values. They're angrily demanding apologies for violating Jesus response here is the opposite. This is the rare one. It's the defiant one where it's like, yeah, no, not sorry. My only regret, if it could be said to be a regret, is that you didn't fully understand how absolutely specifically and intentionally I was trying to say what I was saying. The temple, in case you missed it with all of that history and all that it means and all of its significance, I'm telling you, is going to be torn apart stone by stone, brick by brick as people conceive of a building in ruins. So this will be a building in ruins. Now it possibly, I'm reading where the disciples are at all wrong on this one, but the way Jesus replies to them, the way he answers the questions that come next indicates to me that this is difficult for them. And I don't think that's a mark of weakness on their part. I think it's entirely reasonable for them to be like, but God dwells in the temple and you're the son of God. And like we want to salvage that, we wouldn't want the temple to get destroyed because we would still want God to dwell with us. And of course, it's very difficult for them to conceive of the idea of God with us, meaning Jesus and God's presence in their lives, as opposed to God dwelling in the form of spirit in the temple. But again, if the disciples had some pushback or reservations here, I'm not trying to say that that was a mistake on their part is a completely understandable thing to have a difficult time with. So then if we empathically grant that any Jewish person in the first century would have been troubled by any prediction of the destruction of the temple and a promise of desolation in a way that they hadn't seen for 600 years, understanding that anybody in that time in that ethnic group wouldn't have liked that and would have been troubled with it. It does become kind of interesting to consider what's going on socially here as they make their way across to the Mount of Allah. I suppose option number one is the disciples were pointing to the buildings and they're really big. And Jesus said the stuff he said, but they're kind of replying with, but it's a really big building. Like you would be super hard to knock that over. So I don't know. And this would be the equivalent of the argument from the backseat of the station wagon with Uncle Walter that like, I'm not quite sure I trust your math on that. I'm not sure that this is possible as you might think, Uncle Walter. Another possibility here is that they're just trying to make some kind of tension breaking awkward chit chat, like the role that ant lu seal in the passenger seat might play here, where it's like, well, but can't we all agree that cookies are delicious? Who wants some of those? You know, it's an important role to play. Maybe this is the old change up to lighten the mood a little bit. Maybe the disciples are coming back and they're saying this with the degree of firmness and what they're really asking by pointing back to the grandeur of the temple and its buildings is like Jesus, you don't mean like literally destroyed though, obviously, right? Like gives the metaphor or like one of those cryptic things you say because like we're on your team, but we wouldn't want the temple to get like destroyed. That would be horrible or I suppose another possibility is that maybe a few disciples kind of caught it and they're like, Oh, whoa, whoa, that's a really big deal. There's no coming back from this, but maybe some of the less mature ones are just bobbing along in the backseat of the station wagon and they're like, what temple that's okay, whatever, but look at the buildings. This is really neat. I'm so glad we're all together. I suppose there's also a fifth social possibility here, which I have to acknowledge and that is even though the disciples really wouldn't like the idea of the destruction of the temple, they have been ostracized and threatened and will face the whip and the flog and every single one of them is going to end up getting executed, dying a violent death other than John. This is not an easy road for them. They heard what Jesus said in Matthew 10 about what they were going to go through. If they stuck with him and were ambassadors of his kingdom, maybe fifth option here is they don't get it. They're a little troubled by what he said, but also maybe there's a little flash of vengeance that we saw manifest in James and John when the Samaritans weren't very interested in hanging out with Jesus and they were like, well, should we just burn them with fire from heaven? What should we do? Maybe that's there a little bit too. They're like, okay, well, let's burn the whole thing down then. Fine. Maybe they found it to be somewhat satisfying. I think what you really probably have here is Jesus said some stuff that everybody knows. There's no coming back from everybody knows the course is set and now they can kind of see the road map for how it's going to end up, why it's going to end up, where it ends up. You're socially smart. You get it. There's a ton of dynamics going on here. There's a lot in play and I think it's worthwhile after having gone and looked back through the whole temple story to just pause here and reflect on this moment that transitions us into the bulk of what Jesus has to say in Matthew 24. I like you. I appreciate you. I look forward to this every day. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
