 Hey everybody, I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and a couple years ago we were in Alabama with family visiting some friends down there and there was a high school production of Peter and the Wolf going on which is fun. It's fun for kids because each character gets their own instrument and their own theme and we're used to that because Star Wars, each character has their own theme. But that idea is kind of drawn from stuff like Peter and the Wolf. In Star Wars you get, that's your Jedi theme and, oh, Leia gets a theme. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, well really quickly my kids are picking up on these themes in Peter and the Wolf and they're really getting into it and what's the famous one for Peter and the Wolf, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, I think that's right, and so the play goes on and unfolds and the plot is not terribly dramatic but my kids had a blast and were so enamored with what they'd just seen that they really wanted to go and collect autographs from the high school kids that put on this version of Peter and the Wolf and so we were like, well let's go back there. I don't exactly know that you kids need autographs but let's do it. That was special and memorable and meaningful even if I don't totally understand everything about what you kids are feeling right now and so I remember Camilla went and navigated her way through everything to make sure that the kids could go and interact with the cast members and make this thing happen. Again, why exactly? It's tough to quantify but the kids who performed were really friendly and it's this nice warm happy family memory for us. I think in Matthew chapter 19 we get a similar situation going on. We've got a geographic move that is occurring where most of this story has happened way up north in Galilee and even north of Galilee centered around the Sea of Galilee and this town of Capernaum and now the story is starting to shift south. At the beginning of chapter 19 you'll recall it says when Jesus had finished saying these things he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. So we're crossing state lines. We're moving somewhere new. New people are joining this entourage and wanting to come and be around. Remember it is that this Jesus kingdom thing is about and when we get to verse 13 of chapter 19 we have a situation where a bunch of little kids who maybe don't totally understand what all of this is about still really want to be around Jesus because he's the main event. He's the attraction. He's the exciting thing and my guess is that there are probably some moms like my wife who are making sure that these kids get to make their way over to this intriguing character who is created an interesting memorable moment again even though maybe not everybody totally understands what all of it means in the profound theological sense is an innocence and interest in this. And so Matthew 19 13 it says then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. Jesus said let the little children come to me and don't hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these when he had placed his hands on them he went on from there. In order to picture what's going on here that little geographical note that was thrown out a minute ago I think it really matters because God understand these people have not been witness to all the things that you and I have been witness to going through the book of Matthew. We are in a decidedly new setting to you and me for most of us living half a world away a couple thousand years after the fact these political lines have been redrawn a zillion times over between then and now it just isn't going to pop for us is like oh wow the people would be different. The picture this way if you're from my country and a whole story takes place in rural Wyoming and then the whole story shifts and now it's in Dallas you would never think to yourself like God it's probably all the same people all the same characters same culture same everything whoa whoa Texas is a different world things change dramatically between place one and place two and you couldn't assume that the people in Dallas would have a functioning knowledge of all these little things that happened in the little rural Wyoming setting that hypothetically our imaginary story happened in first likewise here you just can't assume that these Judea people knew much of anything about what was going on in Galilee they would have heard rumors and rumblings but most of their experience with Jesus would not include his teaching it would just be what has happened here large crowds followed Jesus and he healed them there. That's about what they've encountered at this point by point is this these families that have brought their kids out to meet Jesus they don't see the whole picture yet they're on the front end there were you and I were before the sermon on the Mount coming out of chapter four or some interesting rumors and we've got some people who obviously follow him but we don't know what the kingdom is we don't know what the values of it are we don't know where we fit that's where they are and so what happens well some families encounter this thing together and they see what's going on and there's Jesus just sitting right over there and what little kids want to do after they go to their first rock show if there's a line to meet the rock star you go over and you wait in the line and you have them sign your thing and the kids all bashful and that's just how it is if you go to the high school production of Peter and the Wolf you try and catch up with the cast members afterwards likewise these kids saw somebody who seemed talented and gentle and someone who could do things that are miraculous and good and right and kids usually got a pretty decent sniffer when it comes to things that are good and things that are not good there's a cynicism that sets in with age that causes us maybe not to be quite as effective as detecting that when we get older and so these kids are sheepishly walking up to Jesus or being taken over to Jesus that's the exact language then little children were brought to Jesus so it's passive voice and that passive were brought sounds like a nurturing mom that wants to make the connection and I imagine as they get closer to Jesus their courage goes out of them and they're like I don't know if I want to walk over there or not and they're hugging their mom's leg and kind of looking sideways at Jesus sitting over here on this rock and they want to talk to him but they can't think of what to say it's like one of my friends who's got a big YouTube following came to town a few months ago and a bunch of kids wanted to come and say hello and they were all excited for my buddy to get to town but when he actually got here they held on to their mom's legs and were afraid to talk to him for a long time I picture exactly that kind of environment here but the moms or whoever is bringing the children to Jesus they understand that there's some sort of blessing to be conferred here something amazing is happening they're doing this thing that we see throughout Matthew and the other gospels where the people who get it right are the ones who might not be able to give you a theological treatise on why this is a big deal but they understand that not just Jesus in general specifically this moment right now with Jesus being here in our neighborhood right now this point in time saying these words with these people this is a pretty special occasion it's at the heart of what Peter was trying to get right when he wanted to set up booths back at the transfiguration it's what Mary was getting right when she was like I'm just gonna sit here and interact with Jesus we can make food later it's with that lady who burned through all of that expensive perfume crying and washing Jesus feet got right when she realized that her dumb perfume didn't matter nearly as much as the transcendent value of this Jesus who is in front of her that transcendence of the moment is what Jesus was pointing to when he's following up with the crowds after John the Baptist sends his disciples to ask whether Jesus is actually the one and Jesus saying like there's something very special about this moment because I'm here I am with you there'll be plenty of time for other things later on for mourning for concern about this or that but right now if you guys really understood what was in front of you you would be reacting differently well these people in this scenario in Matthew 19 they don't really understand what's happening in front of them but they're still willing to take the chance to walk up and be like I don't get it but I know this is a really big deal and in the moment they can't help but drag themselves over there drag their kids over there and the disciples I think in a well-intentioned attempt to look out for Jesus who I mean come on friends let's follow the course of action here he's taken a beating he's taken a beating from his own family he's experienced loss in his own family he's got people who actively and unapologetically very publicly want to kill him he's got people who are mad he's been kicked out of places for doing things that are right and redemptive he knows what's coming next in his life he's been telling his disciples for what two three chapters now I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm gonna die and it's gonna be ugly he's got kind of a lot on his mind and so the disciples trying to look out for him are like no no no no now that's enough mr. Jesus needs a little bit of time by himself right now we will have another signing tomorrow at 3 p.m. thank you so much for being here we do need you to disperse they're trying to do the security thing the entourage thing and Jesus sees what's going on and he doesn't care about that stuff he just invites the kids over and you'll notice that in this account Jesus doesn't chew out his disciples like well you guys in competent idiot what are you doing all right let the kids come to me how can you not know now he's gentle and welcoming toward the children and tomorrow we'll go from thinking about what this scene might have looked like to thinking about what this scene means and I think we're gonna see that this is a repetition of a very significant theme about what it looks like when somebody comes to the kingdom the right way and is received into the kingdom I think there's gonna be a lot time pack and I think it will be very worth our time and I look forward to doing that tomorrow in the meantime I want to say thank you to everybody who took the time to go and check out that new ironwood rhino podcast that I just started it's a different feel than what we're doing here and that there's always a guest and that the guests all come with a weird strange outlier story stuff that is very difficult to make sense of or to categorize but with each of those stories we have the opportunity one just you're cool interesting fun the story from somebody who's fun and cool and interesting get to know somebody better but two we get to use that as a thought exercise to think about thinking to think about how we know when things are true and how we know when things are not and the skill set that I hope we're nurturing and sharpening over on ironwood rhino I think it's something that's going to benefit us a lot when we look at the claims of the New Testament when we look at the claims of Jesus when we think about all that goes into belief in this kind of a god and the kingdom that's behind it as I said the other day I've gotten to know you you being the people who listen to this program but I think pretty well I think you will figure out very quickly what I'm going for over on ironwood rhino and how it corresponds to what we're working on here I would be so honored if you would go and give that a listen maybe even consider sharing it the other thing I would ask and this is a big ask I understand that but if you would rate and review that ironwood rhino program that is a massive help to me in the early going of that podcast if you've got multiple devices I would take the multiple ratings and reviews seriously thanks for giving that a listen thanks for talking shop about Matthew 19 stuff we'll do more of it tomorrow a mat this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon
