 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and I want to talk more about this Barabbas guy who got picked over Jesus, the crowd was like, man, we could have Jesus who never really did anything or we could have this notorious fellow, Barabbas released to us. Only one of them can escape crucifixion. We want this Barabbas guy. And I don't know. It seems like kind of an important detail, right? It is notorious. He probably has a reputation. The original audience had heard about him. This would have been a very significant point of contrast. It would have fleshed out the story. I want to do some fleshing out. I want to find out what kind of notoriety that we're talking about here. Okay, Matthew 2715. Now it was the governor's custom at the feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. The feast here is the Passover. Of course, we've talked about that a bunch. At that time, they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. Even the crowd had gathered. Pilate asked them, which one do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who's called the Christ for he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. That's mother stuff happens. And then the chief priests and the elders persuade the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. Which of the two do you want me to release to you? Ask the governor again. Barabbas, they answered. Oh, what should I do then with Jesus who's called the Christ? Pilate asked. They all answered crucify him. Why? What crime is he committed? Asked Pilate, but they shouted all the louder crucify him. And then Pilate's like, I see that I'm getting nowhere. Wash my hands of this stuff and it moves forward. So really the only detail we get about Barabbas here is that he's notorious. But what kind of notorious do we mean a notorious prisoner like one who is noteworthy in the sense that everybody's heard of him? Maybe some people really don't like him, but when you look back on him historically, you're like, I don't know that that was a bad guy like Nelson Mandela is a noteworthy prisoner. Some might have called him a notorious prisoner, but he was a pretty good dude. And then you've got the more ambiguous prisoner who is notorious or noteworthy because of the ambiguity of their goodness or badness where people are sharply divided. I think of Julian Assange. You hear all the time that he put a lot of people in danger for saying things that were facts and revealing details that demonstrated naughty behavior on the part of the government. And the government got real mad about that. And it's been an ongoing thing. Well, I don't know. Other people are like, I don't really see where he actually put a lot of people in danger. And don't we want the press to be telling us what's going on with our government? And so he's notorious in that some people think he is the worst. An absolute traitor, treasonous espionage, guilty. And other people are like, that's kind of a public service that that guy is providing. So there's the ambiguous type or instead of those two types of notorious prisoners, Barabbas, more akin to your Charles Manson or your Jeffrey Domer type, people who just did despicable things, horrible things. And then everybody is united in saying that guy is a great big problem. Well, Matthew isn't giving us that detail. We're going to go and look at the corresponding passage in Mark. All right, Mark 15. And so again, Pilate asked him and he's talking to Jesus and Jesus made no reply and Pilate was amazed. Now it was the custom at the feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested, very similar language to Matthew. A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists, aha, who had committed murder in the uprising. The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. He want me to release to you, the king of the Jews asked Pilate, knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him, but the chief priests stirred up the people to have Pilate released Barabbas instead. What shall I do then? What the one you call the king of the Jews? Pilate asked them crucify him. They shouted. Why would crime is he committed? They all shouted louder, crucify him. Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified. Okay, there's a lot of overlap between those two accounts. But here we learn a little bit more. Apparently, Barabbas is the type of notorious prisoner who is an insurrectionist. Now obviously the term insurrectionist is a little bit loaded right now. And it's a term that depending on one's perspective can mean a lot of different things. I'm really not trying to pick a fight about January 6th stuff, but the responses range all the way from complete dismissiveness to absolute head exploding rage over what happened there. Meaning that then like now, just saying somebody's an insurrectionist isn't necessarily enough to mean that they're completely wholesale reviled by all of society. I mean, come on there. People who look at the folks who went in the Capitol building on January 6th and the like those people were heroes, they stood up against corruption. There are other people like those people were absolute treasonous monsters and they should be hung for those crimes and keeping with the ancient tradition. Well, likewise in the first century, we know that there was a whole zealot party. There were people who wanted to see Rome go away was Barabbas part of the zealots. Well, we can't tell that for sure. Based on the two passages we've looked at so far, but Jesus had a zealot in his company. Simon the zealot. He wanted Rome to go away. That's what the title means. I wonder if old Simon the zealot and Barabbas ever actually crossed paths with each other. I wonder which particular insurrection or violent mob incident we're talking about here. Josephus, the extra biblical Jewish historian gives us a lot of examples of these that occurred just a few years before the time of Jesus. I suppose Barabbas could have been a part of any number of those. Maybe Barabbas was a part of some other messianic claim. So there's an extra layer that the original audience would have got here in terms of what his name meant and what sort of notoriety he is associated with. But let's see if we can learn more. Luke is next. One of these books that tells the story of Jesus and I'm going to go to chapter 23. All right. In Luke's account, the religious leaders bring Jesus to Pilate and they accuse him saying, we found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ a king. Pilate asks Jesus, be the king of the Jews. Jesus is like, yeah, you say so. Yes, it is as you say. Then Pilate's like, I don't know. I'd still, like you said that, but I saw a senior reason to charge him with anything. And then some more stuff happens. And then Pilate calls together the chief priests and rulers of the people. It's like, hey, you brought me this man as one who is inciting the people to rebellion. I've examined him in your presence and I found no basis for your charges against him. Neither is Herod. For he sent him back to us. There's an interlude in Luke that we don't get in Matthew where Herod gets to talk to Jesus as well in the midst of all of this. And he's done nothing to deserve death. Therefore I'll punish him and then release him. So Pilate's like, let's just give him a little light flogging, call it good. Everybody's happy. But with one voice, they cried out away with this man, release Barabbas to us. Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city and for murder. Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again, but they kept shouting, crucify him crucify him. That's, you know, obviously that's how it works out. So aha. A little bit more. It's not just that Barabbas was accused of murder or was around murder. Luke is saying like, nah, you can verify it. He was involved in an insurrection. And now we know the insurrection was in Jerusalem. And we know that he's at least heavily accused of murder. Luke is trying to give us the impression indeed that he is guilty of murder. So we're getting a clearer sense of what kind of guy the religious leaders are picking over Jesus. All right. Now we go over to John. This is the last one. That looks like we're going to do some flogging here in 19. Okay. 18. Pilate asked what is truth if I know basis for a charge against him, but it's your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release the quote King of the Jews and they shouted back? No, not him. Give us Barabbas. Now, Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion and Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged and on me go. Okay. So it's possible to cobble together an understanding of Barabbas, where and he is sympathetic. But look, if you don't like Rome or you don't like empires, you know, giant political machines that occupy other people against their will, like I don't, then it's pretty easy to see this guy is some kind of freedom fighter who's one of the few who's brave enough to push back. Yeah, I can make a case that such a person should be lionized and should be notorious for even neutral to possibly even good reasons if you're down with shedding blood for freedom and things like that. But we also got to go with how the biblical authors are handling him, how they're framing it and what they're trying to accomplish here. They're trying to point out that a really bad guy is being chosen over Jesus. They're trying to point out that someone who actually rebelled against Rome is being chosen to be set free over someone who they're saying is rebelling against Rome, but who the Roman governor himself can't find any guilt in. So while I fully acknowledge that I can fill in the gaps of this picture with this barely mentioned historical character and imagine a more noble version of him, I have to acknowledge that the four sources who tell us anything about this Barabbas guy are clearly framing him as a bad dude who did bad things. And they're also clearly trying to tell us that it demonstrates how corrupt and bad the religious leaders were that they wanted this bad dude released. It doesn't take a lot of context taking to figure out that that's how he's being held out. And that further plays into that Matthew theme of rejection is not just that Jesus got picked last. It's not just that Jesus got totally rejected and sent to the cross is not just that he's there all by himself. It's that he's dying in the place of someone who actually had it coming. Huh, you know, now that I think about it, that kind of fits with the theological theme that is appearing within Matthew about why Jesus is going to the cross. We better talk about that more next time around. Hey, real quick, I did a guest appearance on a podcast that I thought was really good not because of what I did, but because of what the podcast is the other day. And I wanted to point it out to you, see, if you want to go check it out, the podcast, I believe is called, can this work in a small church? Carl Vaders is the guy behind it. This guy's a good dude who's into grassroots Christianity, supporting the small local church, where they're out there busting their butts trying to do the right thing, help people serve people, point people to God and stuff like that. I have a lot of admiration for people who work in that small church kind of environment, not like trying to criticize people who work in like big churches, other environments or not churches at all. It's just, I got a soft spot in my heart for people who do that kind of work and don't get any credit for it a lot of the time. And I like what Carl's doing. I like the podcast and I like the conversation I had with him. And so if you want to go and check it out, that'd be awesome. There'll be a link down below. Say hello for me if you make it over there, his direction. Okay, more Barabbas next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
