 ðŸŽµ Bonus episode, a bonus episode Of the 10 minute Bible hour podcast It's a bonus episode, a bonus episode Of the 10 minute Bible hour podcast Come on now! Hey everybody, I'm Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast And I am joined by my close personal friend Jeff Foot in Jeff Foot's basement and studio Hey buddy, Howdy! This is a weird episode, if this is your first time ever on the podcast This isn't what we normally do Normally we work our way through a book of the Bible a little bit every weekday morning This time around however, we are resolving a contest, a game that we put out there for everybody to play Jeff, would you please walk us through how the game works? Absolutely, this is a weird one today Because we're going to be talking about obscure music that most people probably don't care about But some people do, and enough people did, that they sent in answers to a contest that we had Because at the end of some episodes, instead of the regular outro music, we do Easter eggs That feature songs related to something you say in the episode And a lot of times when I'm editing, I'll hear you say something in the episode that Just requires a musical Easter egg It doesn't require it, you just can't help it Yeah, that's true, I cannot help it, I like hearing that But yeah, so what we had over the course of the 400 episodes We had a couple dozen of those Easter eggs, and so the contest was, can you figure out What the song is and why it's in that particular episode Yeah, and the winner is getting cool stuff, and I will now announce what the cool stuff is The winner is getting loaded Nintendo Classic, like the Grey Box Nintendo, straight up, Mail to you that you get to then play video games on And also some cool TMBH merch that I think is cool anyway As well as, well something special that we'll reveal at the end of the episode Yes, it's gonna be very cool I mean, it's a worthwhile prize pack And if you want the ice cream sandwich that I mentioned several episodes earlier As a prize is gonna get gross, but I can do it So I have some questions for you before we dive into the answer Do you remember how this got started? No, I do not remember how this gets started I remember you texted me and said, I need the Princess Bride sword fighting music Oh yeah, because I did the one where I did the horrible voice acting for the intro That was bad And then like a couple episodes later, you were talking about Jesus' reputation And I could not get Joan Jett out of my head No, that has a swear in it So that's why we did it without vocals That's good, and nobody got mad And then it just took off from there Okay, second question, are there any that you know of that we didn't air? Yeah, we didn't air You did head over heels by Tears for Fears On the John the Baptist execution episode It would have been awesome It's too soon It's too soon Little too soon Yeah, maybe in 30-21 It'll be appropriate to joke about that stuff Okay, final question How did we get through 400 episodes of you and me and not do a Tom Petty song? Have we really not? We have really not No, that's lousy We should make one of those I'm gonna find an excuse Okay, you watch Sometime in the next one or two weeks I will say something that completely fits into what we're talking about But it will really serve the other purpose of giving you an excuse to make song And it's not going to be freefallen so don't even But you do that sometimes where You hope that I'll pick up on it and do the song Yes, and we've had that Hey, uh, uh, uh, the UHF soundtrack stuff I don't know what I said like red snappers or supplies or something But it was some line from Cooney on UHF And there's no way that's getting past me No, no, no, clearly not Okay, so here's what we're gonna do I have already eliminated several contestants There were a ton of entries And we've got a few here that serve as a really nice template And I've poked around at some of these So we are going to start with the first entrant The deal was that you just email me your guess as to what the songs meant And why they were in the episodes And these are not direct covers, right, Jeff? No A lot of times it's just based on my memory of how I remember that song Occasionally you'll ask me to do a song I've never heard before And I'll give it maybe two plays through And then I just try to replicate it as best as I can remember So that it isn't too close I'm changing the instrumentation obviously We're doing it without vocals But I don't want to just create a karaoke track Because then it would be a cover I try to make it my own somehow Yeah, a little pastiche, a little homage Which makes it more fun I think people need to understand our formula for this musically Please We are aiming for the perfect cross section Of Impressive And dumb I don't know maybe we should talk about this again But I'm just going to throw it in right here You made all this music people are going to want to find your music Where do they go and get Jeff Foote music? The best place to find the music It's on Spotify It's on YouTube But if you'd like to purchase it, it's on Bandcamp Under my name Jeff Foot Alright, it's called Sea of Tranquility That's the album Sea of Tranquility is the album that's up there on Bandcamp And that's the music that we use all over the podcast Correct Which is great Thank you, buddy Okay, uh, what are we talking about? Okay, the first entrant was Matthew Lohr And I've got his entry right here We're going to go through a few of these Early going, uh, he's got a bunch right Wow Matthew is being very, very thorough Ooh, we're talking about references to the Psalms project stuff that we did with Shane Heilman That we promoted a little bit It's still good stuff He keeps putting out new things And it's going very well I want to claim credit for that That was actually really good That was actually, actually excellent Thoughtful and Haslerix That's great He's rightly identified all of your stuff Ignition sequence is the normal outro music Right? Correct Da na na na na na na na na na Exactly Okay Uh, okay, so here we go Bad reputation, don't get in the black hearts Because you talk about one's reputation Alright, so Yeah, Matthew is getting the drill That is correct I've been through most of this Cats in the cradle That one appeared twice That's one of my favorites It's a really good cover I like that you added the kitty sound Uh, that was episode 210 Matthew rightly points out that episode 211 was What I think might be my favorite song that you've done It's the homage to I'll make a man out of you from Mulan As sung by Who's the original Donnie Osmond Donnie Osmond And the song was written by Matthew Wilder Who also performed famously in the 1980s Break My Stride Which is also another one of the pastations Oh, a recent one Oh, you're very good at that Very good at that Uh, yeah, and that is the ringtone On my phone for you, by the way When you call it's the Mulan Uh, yeah, Lord of the Rings He's getting all the reasons right He got the Zelda theme right from 219 That was the hardest one you gave me, by the way Really? Yeah The chords in that The way the melody goes Is so not like anything else Which one do we do? We did the Hyrule theme, right? Yeah That's beautiful, man There's a lot of notes in that one That don't follow any sort of scale Which is probably why it's so catchy Because it doesn't sound like anything else Okay, Matthew struggled a little bit Down the Home Stretch Looks like he missed 0397 He listed that as After Taxes by Johnny Cash But that was a very unique cover And the song was actually Taxman by The Beatles And it's a unique cover because We did that one in my house Yeah, we were at your house And I didn't have any of my gear You just had an acoustic guitar So we stuck the microphone on it and went Yeah, it worked out, we had fun 0396, he correctly identified as Cabo Wabo by Van Halen Is that Van Hagar? It was Van Hagar, that was Yeah, that was the only way to do it Well, yeah, I soon as asked the question I felt bad because As Cabo went in, everything Cabo was San Diego He correctly identified as episode 0395 Which was a listener question episode As some of your questions by Jeff Foot Oh yeah, that's a good one That's a real good one Yeah, Matt answers all of your questions Okay, maybe not all of your questions Not all of your questions That's a real one was fun Time constraints here All right, he correctly identified 0390 When you believe from Prince of Egypt 0385, he had as Dreams by Fleetwood Mac This is a massive stretch But I searched for things having to do with Dreams Okay, so he knows it's probably not dreams By Fleetwood Mac No, 0385 would have been Matthew Wilder That we talked about a bit ago With Break My Stride But I don't remember Prince of Egypt Yeah, we talked about the Mariah Carey song There Can Be Miracles When You Believe That one Surely you did that, right? I don't think I did But I definitely talked about it in that episode So it would make the most sense Let's see, what did we do? That was 0390 It's Mike and the mechanics All I needed is a miracle I see what we did Okay, that's a good guess But a strike against you, Matthew Sorry When in doubt, always air on the side of 80s 0381 He's got the lion sleeps tonight I don't think that's what it was That was the best deal song we were talking about, right? I think 0381 was probably the one that stuck most people Um, well, let's scroll through some more of these answer sheets and see what we get Nate Jacobi I Awesome I think that's an honorable mention I think that lands him in the honorable mention What I'm looking at here Is a spreadsheet with 400 lines With the answer to every single episode being Never going to give you up by Rick Astley You're a good person, Nate You're a very good person Oh dear Bow, fris, fris, fris, I think I don't know, hopefully I'm saying that right, Bow I'm impressed that Bow correctly got all the components of episode 369 Which had cold as ice Hot and cold by Katy Perry And hot blooded So it's Katy Perry with foreigner on either hand Foreigner on either side Yeah, that was a fun one It was good Yeah, he got 236 Uh 236 is a really tricky one I haven't seen anybody nail it But Bow is close 236, I specifically contacted you And was like, hey, I need here I go again By white snake Yep, but the game of throne speed Uh That's a very solid entry from Bow He is among the finalists Zachary Stewart's entry right here Also among the finalists He got the careless whisper Wham montage from 278 Did he also get the last Christmas on the fadeout? I don't think he mentions it That was an Easter egg within an Easter egg Yeah, you do that You did that with aha tag at the end of blinding lights by the weekend It really is the same zone It really is the same zone This is a really solid showing here From Brian Villanueva Where are the rings? Zelda Oh, you got the, what does the fox say? Animal medley That was a good showing Uh, the Optimus Prime episode Man, and the answers are really good on this one He got secret ambition, the Michael W. Smith cover I didn't think a lot of people would get that That's pretty obscure old school Christian pop music In the days of 80s youth group And that's one where you stuck an obscure lyric in the episode Oh, I did Yeah, he's got beautiful disaster Episode 311 was by 311 Yep, he got One Night in Bangkok by Murray Head That was a difficult one from episode 345 Got both parts of the white stripes cover episode 359 Which is a Seven Nation Army and fell in love with the girl So on the white stripes Yes There is an Easter egg within that Easter egg And the third riff in that is a racquetur's song Which oh, you're right, Jack White also played in that thing Yep, you're right We got a great entry here from Moo-kapie-i-n Yeah, all I have is the email address I don't know what that means But it was a very good entry with a ton of detail And a really good showing on the rationale I want to give a shout out to JP Job Who got several of these right But ultimately not enough to be in competition for the victory However, he made a rough sketch of a t-shirt idea For millstone harvard daycare It says Matthew 186 That's outstanding That's awesome That That makes me irrationally happy So I have a question There's a couple of just I'm going through my list here That I thought might be a little too hard for people to get And then maybe we should talk about in case people were stuck Alright, let's do it Yeah, give me the difficult ones You mentioned Johnny Cash covering the 9-inch nails Yes And then I did the 9-inch nails version Not the Johnny Cash version Yes, and this entrant nails that Listen to this entry Matt mentions the phrase My empire of dirt from hurt by 9-inch nails Or covered by Johnny Cash parentheses I prefer the Cash version As a quote That would have cache with those I mean, this is a good entry Absolutely new nail But that was one I should confess I am not going to try to cover Johnny Cash Covering hurt Because that's one of the greatest songs ever The original or the cover? The cover The cover is one of the greatest songs ever But I wasn't going to touch that with a 100-foot bowl That's why I went back to the original Another one is the James Horner Sounds good Yeah, and a lot of people assumed it was Braveheart Because we talked about Braveheart But we should have been Braveheart Also talked about Edward Zwick's Glory Glory So I pulled an audible one James Horner did the soundtrack for both of those Also famous for Apollo 13 He did Titanic There we go That's significant You did a whole thing on Robert the Bruce Yes Which lends itself to Braveheart music I'm going to fight as he does I remember that one You sent me a text saying Hey, there's this great band out there that does Viking Metal Yes, Sabaton And can you do the Braveheart theme over this idea? And I said No Because Glory is the greatest soundtrack of all time Which I agree with And James Horner plagiarized himself on Braveheart That's fine So we did the Viking Metal It's the line up before the storming of Fort Wagner From Glory Exactly That's a hot light Braveheart during the execution So I think if anyone guessed Braveheart We should give him credit I think that's fair I could not tell the two apart by humming them That's a wonderful homage you did on that one by the way There's a really good entry from Dustin Coats Who went out of his way To figure out each of the songs you did on your album There's theme music for each day Bonus points I'm sure everybody's figured out that We use the same music on each day of the week Some people have even told me that they can Detect which day that episode was from Because they're so in the rhythm with it Which is awesome So that was a very good entry Jeff Brock had a good entry That made it to my finals list Love the fact that Jeff got every element of the muse A montage that you did in episode 305 That started with, do you remember? It started with Stockholm Syndrome Yep, it sounds like chaos It's so good And then my favorite rock song of the 2000s Came in second Starlight I had to wear this song It's so pure It's so good It's so clean I love this And oh, and the Knights of Sidon there Wow, Muse is good at rock Excellent And that one, you basically just bragged about muse For half of that episode That's a episode well spent I mean, you think about it Every one of these melodies exists in the ether God knew all of these melodies existed Before creation and time were put in place And so when a musician Goes and finds that hook, that riff That little thing They're not inventing it They're not writing it They are discovering it And drawing it From out of the eternal ether of the mind And creation and possibilities That God has given in the physical world It's a moment of supreme union With the divine When someone writes an amazing hook Or an amazing riff And then there's other stuff that I think maybe God in his sovereignty Was like, all right, lusifer prince of darkness I'm gonna let you just write some garbage And I think that's probably what Lincoln Park tapped into I thought for sure you were gonna go matchbox 20 That would be my second one Those are the two Those are the two I cannot abide Matchbox 20 I hope you don't like your rock to rock Adam, I assume I say Sequoia That's a really cool last name Had an entry that made it to the finals as well Did not quite rise to the level of those other two And Thomas Birch Man, this is a good entry Episode 271, careless whisper by Wham Voices carried by Til Tuesday Matt relates how Jesus fulfills Isaiah's prophecy Of how the Messiah will come as a meek peaceful man Will not shout or cry out Or raise his voice in the streets He will not utter a careless whisper And he will hush-hush keep it down now Because voices carry Oh my goodness That's such a good answer Okay, that one behold That's such a good answer Oh, it's wonderful All right, last one That needs our attention Is alley And her entry is very thorough I'm going through all of the touchy ones here Man, this is a good showing Did she get the cars? Of course she got the cars Well, that's good Janet Jackson Yes And she's rolling her eyes at you for even asking Yeah Yeah, okay Out of the finals I found three really solid final final finalists But ultimately I have landed on my winner And before I announce that What else do we need to discuss about this? I had promised When I was doing some voiceovers While you were on vacation That the winner would get a song written In their honor Yes And then you had the idea this week The runners up get a song for themselves Yeah, I think so too And I think everybody we've talked about Today belongs on that list And their lists were so good That they deserve a song They deserve a song I mean something To express admiration and appreciation For the hard work they put in That's right Jeff Just were you able to prepare something? I absolutely was Kali, could we listen to that now In honor of the people who finished second and third And I guess I don't really know how else to announce this Other than to say who the second and third place winners are Please Okay, well tying for second Are going to be Dustin Coates And Ally Mulemberg And your answers were spectacular But there was one person Who put together such an impressive list That they bested even the two of you I am so grateful that you participated Dustin and Ally? Dustin and Ally Yeah, they belong in a world of winners They do belong in a world of winners So with that announcement made Dustin, Ally, this one's for you You did your best But you didn't win And now you're full of shame But left your face There's no disgrace If they get second place You put in the time Put in the time But still you lost And now you're full of shame But here's to you The losing fuel Did they quit the game?
