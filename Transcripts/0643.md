 Does Jesus hate poor people? Because in Matthew 26 he says the poor are always going to be with us and he acts just real super dismissive. That was my best attempt at clickbait. It wasn't very good. No, I don't think Jesus hates poor people at all. I think you really like some. I think that's why he said that stuff that he did back at the very, very beginning of his time in public where he laid out the values of the kingdom with his very first speech. He's like blessed are the poor in spirit. He says that right away right at the front end. Yeah. I think he has a real soft spot for people who are lowly, poor, and poor in spirit. I think he's making a different point here in Matthew chapter 26 in this passage that we've been looking at together that feels like a little interlude in the action where whether Matthew is taking us on a flashback journey or whether an evening is passing here and we're getting an incident that looks a lot like one that unfolded maybe a few days earlier in the week. Either way, this story about Jesus being anointed at the house of Simon the leper is one that gives us a famous biblical phrase that is often repeated by religious people, non-religious people, and the phrase is the poor will always be with us or the poor you will always have with you. That could certainly be taken to be harsh or dismissive, but I think we just need to take a minute and think about it in light of what we're looking at here. Look, I don't want to oversell the problem here. I think this is a pretty easy one to sort through. This lady, she dumps out the super expensive perfume. We learn from other accounts that we're probably looking at a year's worth of money that she just burned anointing Jesus. The disciples need your reaction is to get real mad. The money could have been given to the poor and that is what prompts Jesus to say this. It's just one of the most important rules in watching a movie, reading a book, hearing a story, listening to something a friend is telling you that I have picked up along the way and I can't believe this wasn't just intuitive to me that I actually had to have it explain to me, but I'm glad somebody took the time to do it. One of the most important things in hearing a story and encountering a story the right way is to think about why the characters were prompted to say and do the things they were prompted to say and do. One of my, do I want to say the word gripes? That sounds so harsh. I guess I already said it. We're going with it. One of my gripes with what you read that people write about the Olivet Discourse Matthew chapters 24 and 25 is that they often don't take into account at all why Jesus is talking. The disciples asked like, how's this all going to go down? What's going to be the end of things? What will be the sign of your returning? They gave him a very specific question. They're under very specific pressures at a very specific moment in their lives in history at a very specific place overlooking another very specific set of scenery. And those are all the things that inform why Jesus gives the answer that he gives that we just spent so much time looking at in chapters 24 and 25. The occasion, the fancy word for it, that prompts a character to say or do a thing is very important to understanding their meaning. In this case, again, Jesus is prompted to say this by the indignant reaction of the disciples. Why are you bothering this woman? As we've discussed, he first sticks up for the lady because her moment just got crushed and it was a jerk thing to do. And he's going to make sure that her moment happens and is recovered. She has done a beautiful thing to me. See, he gets it, but now he has to defend his thesis. And that's what he does here. The poor you will always have with you, but you won't always have me. We looked at all that other stuff throughout the book of Matthew that demonstrate the immediate value of Jesus and how much Jesus celebrates and affirms the people who physically came into contact with who got the importance of the moment. But we haven't gone back through and scrubbed carefully through all of the stuff about generosity and how it was indicative of the wrongness of the Pharisees that they didn't care about people of low position. We haven't gone back and dug through each of the points about giving to the needy, though Jesus very specifically says that there is a right way to do that at the level of the heart in the Sermon on the Mount. We haven't dug deeply back into the Beatitudes where people of low position and specifically I mean the very first low position that's listed is the poor in spirit. We haven't gone and dug through that carefully again though, but I think that stuff is fresh enough in our brain and simple enough on the surface to immediately write off any assertion that Jesus just doesn't care about the poor. It's not a big deal. However, I also don't think there's enough of it to cause us to come away from the book of Matthew and be like Jesus number one priority was economic justice as we think of it in the 21st century. Jesus number one priority was making sure that that next hot meal got into the belly of that poor person. Instead, I think it's crystal clear that the number one priority of Jesus is the redemptive plan, the will of his father and encompassed in that establishing the kingdom. Now in the kingdom, one of the values is justice. One of the values is compassion. One of the values is forgiveness, though this might not be the exact word that's used in the book of Matthew. One of the values is empathy and ability to imagine what someone else is going through that would prompt a person as Jesus discussed at the end of chapter 25 to be like, dang, you're in prison. I'm going there. Dang, you need to be clothed. I am clothing you. Dang, you are sick. I am going to take care of you. Your thirsty, I'm going to give you something to drink. So a right kingdom value response to the needs of other people is something Jesus has just made it very clear that that's an overflow of the values of the kingdom. If there's no impulse toward that, it's possible that you're exclusively a citizen of the world kingdom and not the kingdom kingdom at all, but the kingdom redemption, the glory of his father obedience to his father, those are biggest picture highest values, orienting points in all of Jesus actions and words. But he's also made it clear going back, especially to the accusations of falseness and religious fraud toward the Pharisees in Matthew chapter 23 and also the allegations of religious fraud directed at people like the Pharisees back in the sermon on the Mount. He's also made a really clear that is to say that you can give money and stuff to people or give alms or give sandwiches to poor people, but you can do it for disgusting, gross, self-aggrandizing reasons. And just the simple act of having done that is no indicator of a right heart or having embraced the values of the kingdom. Jesus isn't saying, so what? Forget the poor. Who cares? He's saying, guys, you're going to have an entire lifetime to play out this necessary aspect of kingdom values because there are plenty of poor people and there always will be plenty of poor people. So far, 2000 years of history have proven that right. And every time somebody comes along and seizes the mechanisms of production and power and is like, we're going to eliminate poor people. We're going to solve everything. They end up making everybody poor and then having to murder a bunch of people to try to keep their stupid idea afloat a little bit longer. Now, Jesus has been vindicated in this statement. We have not yet found the singular universal solution to make every single person not poor and eliminate poverty as we think of poverty in every way. Though I do think we have to acknowledge that there is a certain kingdom virtue to including people in the game of basically buying and selling and trading and getting to participate freely with other people. That has caused an unbelievable reduction in global poverty, but still Jesus is right. There are poor people because stuff breaks and stuff is wrong because we're frail and we're weak and we make mistakes and our systems are imperfect and even my beloved free market for all of the levels at which I agree that freedom of opportunity produces these great results. It doesn't for everybody. Just seems to me that history demonstrates it to be less unequitable than any other system. Now, the bottom line is we have not found a way to economically or govern mentally solve poverty and human suffering. Jesus is absolutely right when he tells his disciples, essentially, you're going to have an unending amount of opportunity to serve the poor and do what you want to do compassionately toward those in need. You're not going to have an unending opportunity to have me sitting right here in the room. You guys are maybe taking it a little bit for granted. The lady right here though, she gets it and maybe she even gets it on a level that's even deeper than that because she accepts that I am headed to the cross that I am headed to the grave and she is seizing on this opportunity to anoint me for burial, which makes this scolding even harsher. Guys, how many times have I told you, I'm going to die and it's going to be like, you know, this week, she's doing things that indicate that she understands the limited time we have together and how precious every moment with her king is. While you guys are judgmentally lounging around, griping at how other people are spending their money and their resources. Bad luck, dudes. Bad luck. And then he wraps it up with this statement of remarkable, remarkable blessing. I tell you the truth, whenever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her. What's the chance that Matthew heard Jesus say that felt super convicted that he got it wrong, that he responded wrong to her action. And when he actually got out the pen and is sitting somewhere candlelight, some stone hut right in this stuff down, he's like, man, that story makes us look terrible. Okay. I'm not going to admit that I agreed with Judas Iscariot. I'm not, I'm not going to put any names down for who said this stuff. We're just going to collectively own that we were all indignant because we were. But my king said that this story would be told until the end of everything as long as the message of his kingdom is preached. And so her story has to go in here. And if it's pretty well right here in the middle of chapter 26, he didn't know it was going to be called chapter 26, but you see what I'm driving at. I love this story. It makes me feel things. It does not make me feel superior. It makes me feel humbled because I think I would have been like the disciples, not saying that to sound cool. And we go, yeah, I've got some lessons to learn to guys. No, it's genuinely, I think my reaction would have been, oh, that's a little bit much. And I think it would have been snarky. I think it's a moment where that little bit of smugness that every now and then I can pull out and that I try to hide from you that little bit of judginess that every now and then I can feel that impulse toward that I try to hide from you. I think it would have come out here. And I think I would have been right on board with those guys in being embarrassed and imagining myself maybe superior and more in the loop. And I would have wanted to do a little more like I've been there done that like, okay, I've hung out with Jesus enough. I don't think I need to anoint him all the time. I think I just would have made an idiot of myself in this situation. And so I feel properly chastened by Jesus words here and properly inspired by how much Mary got it right and how much she understood. There's a treasure in that field. Sell everything you got to go get it. Nothing matters more. Cool passage. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. I'll locks up.
