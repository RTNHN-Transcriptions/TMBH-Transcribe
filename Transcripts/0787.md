 Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. And whenever I talk with a friend who is going back to a place where they lived for a while, I always ask them what food are you going to get that you miss from there that you can only get there. And some people are like, I already got everything out of that place. I'm never going to want to get them done with it. But most people can think of something like, I'm going to go to, yeah, this little diner down here or my friends and I, when we get together, we always get together that this place like we did back in the day. I think that's a pretty common human impulse, right to go back to a location that is a common touch point where you got some history. And it looks like that very human homing location impulse is something that is on display here in the relationship in Matthew 28 between Jesus and his disciples as well. Because if you recall, when Jesus appeared to the women at the tomb, and then they assumed a right posture before they king, they fell at his feet and worshiped him. And then he gives him the instruction that there to go and tell his brothers to go to Galilee. And there they will see Jesus. And just before that, the angel had told them effectively the same thing. He's risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him. Now I've told you. So okay, it's crystal clear. We're going to do for old time's sake. rendezvous here, except it looks like what is setting up is not just a four old time's sake kind of thing. It looks more like a relaunch, if you will. So one of the questions that I guess I would have coming out of those instructions would be where in Galilee, because it's big and we don't have cars. Maybe the disciples just knew, like, Hey, you know, we're going to go to the place, like, obviously the place where I would meet you if we were there. Maybe you have a relationship with a friend where you can just be like, Hey, let's get lunch. We're going to the place. Okay. Or if you just say, let's get lunch. Maybe you and that friend only go to one place and you should just, you know, exactly what it's meant. Maybe there's some kind of intonation of a supernatural thing happening here. We're in the same way that God divinely led the Magi to the Christ back in chapter two. So here at the very end, we're supposed to glean that God is somehow leading them to the right place to see the Christ here. I think the more likely deal is that they just knew where to go. And so that's what they do. Verse 16, then the 11 disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. Okay. So it looks like they had some degree of specificity. But where did they get that? And so just go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me. There's nothing specific there. Quick side. Now you notice that there were 11 disciples now is because obviously Judas is dead and out of the equation at this point and Matthias, the replacement who comes along and acts, he is not there yet. And so they go to this mountain and I can picture the scene before we even try to think about what mountain this would be or what would be like their old stomping around their old hangout, which we are going to do. But I can picture the scene, right? How many of these sequences that we've seen unfold throughout the book of Matthew have felt like they were unfolding around a campfire. Where else are they? Right? They're not in an inn. They're somewhere out along the way on the road. I assume they did a lot of camping. I think of chapter 15 and the big road trip up north that took them near Caesarea Philippi and the Decapolis and would have taken them to some very different topography. We've got tradition up there. The confession of Christ happened in a certain spot. And if it did happen there, I guess that would have been a camping trip. So it looks like the text is cool with vaguely framing a similar scene here. How much of this really important heart to heart stuff happened in nature surrounded by this circle of trust before it all got interrupted by politics and the religious leaders and the buildings and the hustle and the bustle and the social pressure and the crowds and the yelling and the stabbing and all of the stuff that happened in Jerusalem were back to something simpler here, something pastoral and something familiar. There's a book that came out a while back. I don't know how true it is or how reliable it is. It's like the five love languages. Is it five? Maybe it's five gifts, saying nice stuff, time, touch. What am I forgetting? I never read the book, but I think this is just something you're supposed to know automatically. This is probably why I'm a monster and no one loves me. I don't know what the fifth thing is and it's probably the thing that all of you need. But what I'm trying to say is that I've been told by a few of my friends that my love language is lunch. Not because I like the food so much. It's supposed to be a relatively slight guy. I lift a few weights. I try, but I am what I am. No, it's not about hogging down a bunch of food. It's about buying a ticket to a deep dive conversation with somebody I care about. I want to sit across from this person and not talk with anyone else right now. I want someone else to take care of the details of the meal and the food and all of that. I'm happy to pay extra money to effectively hire someone to do that while we sit and enjoy a meal. I want to sit for as long as it takes and I want to work through an idea. I want to talk. I want to listen. I want to know. I want to be known. It's a very familiar rhythm for me and a lot of the most meaningful things that have ever been said to me or that I've ever had the opportunity to say to someone else have happened over food and often in that one-on-one lunch kind of environment, usually in some kind of booth, you got to get the booth and not the table. If it's a kind of restaurant where they got a light that hangs down and illuminates each table individually with some pleasant noise cover, and I can sit face in the door because I got to sit face in the door, then it's probably going to be a great time. Likewise, I think what Jesus is setting up here is such a welcome relief, such a welcome return to something familiar for these guys. Profound things have happened here, and this is their love language. This is their conversational language. I felt a little gross saying that, but I'm just going to keep it and we're going to roll with it. Maybe the guys don't know exactly what to expect with this trip that they are making to go and spend time with Jesus in Galilee. Maybe some of them imagine that we're just going to pick up where we left off. We'll do another three years just like we did before. Maybe some of them, heck, maybe all of them, given the next verse when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. Maybe they were doubting as well, and they weren't even sure if they were interacting with a real person. I mean, this is a kind of mess with you. I don't know what the range of emotions were, but what I do know is it looks like Jesus has strategically picked a place that is familiar, that is away from the hubbub, that is going to smell like a place everybody is familiar with, where the days are going to age in a way that everybody feels familiar with. The food is going to be familiar. And here, he is going to ultimately commission them toward the thing that is going to define the rest of their lives and everything about their legacy. There are many household names from the first century AD outside of this story, but all of these guys are about to be commissioned to do something that is going to make them household names forever and ever and ever. But even that isn't the ultimate point. They're being commissioned to play an unprecedented pivotal vital role in the unfolding and the building of the kingdom of which they are citizens. What a privilege. I want to talk more about that mountain tomorrow. We'll see if we get through that and some other stuff. I want to say thanks to Samaritan Ministries for sponsoring the podcast here and there over the last several weeks and a couple of times over on the YouTube channel as well. It's just been cool to get to tell you about Samaritan in general because of what an incredibly useful thing that has been in our lives. I've got the phrase pretty dialed at this point, but I like it because it nails it really succinctly. Samaritan Ministries, for those of you who might not know yet, is a community of Christians who helps pay each other's medical bills without the use of insurance. We use this. It has worked wonderfully for us. We've saved a ton of money in terms of what our monthly share costs and you'll notice that language monthly share that is a little different. It might be a little bit foreign, but it's reflective of the reality of the situation. The way Samaritan works is if you have a need that comes up, you get whatever medical attention or healthcare you need, then you submit that to Samaritans and they have other members of the community send you their monthly share so that then you can pay those bills. I love the execution of it, but I also love the philosophy behind it. I love the way it serves as a constructive proposal for what is a very overwrought, overcomplicated, complex problem. That being the cost of healthcare and getting the healthcare you want that has not been easily addressed in my country. I think this is a great solution and I'd be really grateful if you'd go and see if it might be for you as well. You can check out samaritanministries.org slash TMBH to find out more.
