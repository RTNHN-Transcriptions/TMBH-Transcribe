 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story and this one is about the whole New Testament. Hello my friends! Last time around we did a great big picture gigantic overview of the Old Testament. This time around we're going to do the same thing with the New Testament. The Old Testament doesn't lead right over into the New Testament though. There's that in between time that we talked about at length in a bonus episode and the simple version of that time is this. The Persians are on the scene at the very end of the Old Testament but then Alexander the Great and his Greek-ish armies conquer Persia and bloodlessly conquer Jerusalem. Then Alexander the Great dies young. His generals divide up his massive empire and after a little bit of passing things around the Seleucid Empire, a Greek empire comes to control the Jewish people in Jerusalem and what would later be called Judea. That does not go well and the Jews finally are like we've had enough of the idolatry and everything else and they throw off their Greek overlords and they establish their own kingdom that runs from the mid-160s BC into the mid-60s BC. And for that hundred years we get one more reminder that we are in need of a new paradigm and that humanity cannot get out of its own way. It's a corrupt mess that kingdom does not go well and eventually it goes so badly that they have to invite this new upstart empire from way out west, the Romans to come in and settle things down and Rome never gives back control after they show up. And eventually the proud independent Hesmonian dynasty of the Jewish people gives way to them being a subject state and then a client king state under the authority of Rome and occupied by Roman government and Roman soldiers. So by the time Jesus is born there's a lot of different opinions about who the Messiah ought to be ranging from political military leader who can get rid of the Romans and establish yet another kingdom all the way over to people who've all been given up on the Messiah. Jesus birth happens while a not even really Jewish guy is the Roman sponsored local king, a guy named Herod the Great, but over him is Caesar Augustus, the first emperor of all of Rome and Jesus gets born in Bethlehem just as the prophets had predicted in everything about his birth to the Virgin Mary is in keeping with all the predictions about the Messiah in the Old Testament and everything about his lineage is in keeping with the line of David because the Messiah would have to be from the line of David. And so the pedigree is right. We don't know much about Jesus yet when he's a teeny tiny little baby, but even the nations or representatives from the nations come to worship him in the very early going. There are signs in his youth that it looks like he is pretty special and pretty remarkable, but it goes public and it goes big when around the age of 30 he gets baptized by his cousin, John the Baptist who has led a religious revival out in the wilds looking like something of a wild man himself and at Jesus baptism, the father and the Holy Spirit both show up affirming Jesus as well. I mean, how could you miss it? The Messiah and the father even says this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased and we landed on pretty thick here. It's looking like this is probably going to be the Messiah, but given how busted up the psyche and the cultural memory of the Jewish people is and given how busted up their religious situation is and how loyalties are all divided their calluses and cynicism that have taken over. It's not going to be as easy as just being like, okay, well, I'm descended from the right people on the Messiah. You can trust me. Everybody follow God now. It doesn't work like that. But in the early going, there is a lot of reason to be optimistic. Jesus recruits an inner circle of followers and he starts doing miraculous stuff and teaching brilliant things and people are very compelled by it. It looks like in the early going, there's a big public speech where Jesus takes his disciples up on a mountainside and starts to teach them. And in the audience as well are people who aren't quite sure what to make of Jesus as well as people who kind of have a problem with it and are initially very put off and eventually get so put off that they end up killing him. But in this big speech, Jesus lays out that he is the fulfillment and the completion of the whole Old Testament story, all the stuff that the prophets were saying, all the narrative arcs from all of the stories and all of the characters at all points to him. And indeed, all of the law about the sacrificial system and the temple and just everything about that robust multifaceted story is completed in Jesus of Nazareth. Well, everybody's impressed with the speech. They're all like, dang, he taught with legitimate authority, not like our teachers of the law. Jesus is different, but it's a really big claim. And so people are wondering, can he back up those amazing words with action? Well, what we get in the ensuing months of Jesus's story is affirmation that, yeah, indeed, he can back that up with action. He demonstrates power and authority over pretty much everything, every hurdle that we encounter in human life, including the really big stuff, like the physical, natural world around us and distance and time and the physical body and the existence of matter and non matter that disease. He's got power over all of that. He's got the power to note things that he could not know that other people are thinking. He's got power over the spiritual world, millions of darkness invisible forces. He can handle all of that. And he's even got power over death, which is obviously the big one. But perhaps the most stunning power of all, maybe the reason, at least in part, that all of this power was demonstrated. The point to this one power is he has the power and authority to forgive sins, to resolve that thing that separates people from God. He can forgive sins. He can do that. And indeed, he links his miracles to his power to forgive sins. So clearly, whatever he's doing is about more than just breaking the laws of time and space to impress people, it's about taking a swing at the biggest, grandest problems of all of existence. Well, this is very threatening to the religious leaders. They're supposed to be the mediators between God and men. They're the ones who are supposed to be the mediators of when God dishes out things like forgiveness. And if Jesus is what he says, he is, then why do they even exist? Over the course of his life, Jesus is rightly identified as the Christ, the Messiah, the one who was promised to sit on the throne of David forever, the son of God, God in the flesh, God himself. And that's just too much for the religious leadership who finally figure out a way to weasel him into a Roman execution. Pontius Pilate is the one who ultimately slams down the gavel and pronounces the sentence. But it was entirely at the behest of the religious leadership of the day. Jesus goes and dies on a cross. But then as he predicted three days later, he comes back to life and he does so in front of a whole bunch of witnesses and not just witnesses who like him, witnesses who aren't rooting for him. And the religious leaders can't produce the body and Jesus empowers his disciples to take the message and run with it before he ascends into heaven and gives them the Holy Spirit with the bizarre imagery of tongues of fire over their heads. This little group of Jesus followers starts speaking in Jerusalem and languages that theoretically don't speak, but everybody's understanding the message of Jesus in their own language and thousands of people start signing up to follow Jesus immediately. And that does not seem to ever lose pace throughout the entire Bible story. Even when the religious leadership starts cracking down on Jesus disciples and the next generation of disciples after that, even killing them, it does nothing to dissuade them. They just communicate the message of Jesus harder and miraculous stuff keeps happening. And indeed, one of the people who was initially killing the Jewish people ends up converting to faith in Christ after an encounter with the risen Jesus on his way up to hurt more Christians in Damascus. And then this fellow, whose name was Saul and eventually comes to be known as Paul, starts making these missionary journeys all around the Mediterranean world, telling people in ways that they would understand in their given culture and community who Jesus is and how this supplies to them. And all of a sudden the Gentiles are in. This isn't even just a Jewish thing anymore. It goes global in a matter of a few years. Now these churches aren't perfect. And so Paul and others are always writing back and forth, trying to help them navigate what it is to be a Christian in their community in the face of persecution. And ultimately, even though the big names in terms of early Christian leaders like James, the brother of Jesus, who was the head of the church in Jerusalem and Peter, the most prominent of Jesus immediate circle of disciples. And Paul, the disciple to the Gentiles, even though those guys and all the big name disciples who were with Jesus other than John meet fantastically gory ends as martyrs for the message of Christ. It doesn't slow anything down. More people keep becoming Christians. They live with the values of the kingdom that Christ was talking about clear back in that sermon on the Mount. And indeed, the church has never looked back since becoming the biggest global phenomenon in the history of anything ever. And it's not even close in the same way that the first book of the Old Testament looks back to the very dawn of time and even beyond. So the final book in the New Testament looks forward beyond and all the way into the day of the Lord, the era, the time, the moment when everything gets set right. The evil is judged and corrected. The evil nations are finally called to account and Christ's kingdom is established and realized in a visible obvious way. And there's a new Jerusalem and God's people are with him and God's spirit dwells with them into eternity. On the whole, I think it's a really good story. If you haven't had a chance to read the whole thing, I encourage you to just pick it up and start chewing through it because it's great. When you visualize a New Testament picture, Jesus Christ crucified and then risen. When you think about the theme, reflect on Jesus, who is the Messiah and the King who was promised, who died and was resurrected for the sins of the world and will return in justice and power to reign forever. Also implied in that theme is that you fit in there somehow. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, try to get John and Romans. Cue the New Testament level up sound. Hey, we got one more episode rounding out this series on this whole journey through the Bible. We've done together. And then on Monday, we start the new one on the Book of Esther and I would be elated if you would consider being a part of that. I'm throwing a ton of work at it right now and I'm so excited for what we're going to get into. Finally, I have a request. If you like this stuff and it's been fun, would you leave a review on any and all podcast apps? Obviously, it's always encouraging myself to read that and I do read all of those. But also, podcast apps like to recommend podcasts that get reviews. And so if you go and review this program on any and all podcast apps, it really helps to get new people involved in the conversation and I want that to happen. All right, final big picture thoughts on this whole project tomorrow and then we're on to Esther after that. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. This podcast is supported by many of you at patreon.com slash the TMVH podcast. We're grateful because it supports our family.
