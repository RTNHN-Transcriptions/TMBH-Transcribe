 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour. And if you are looking at the timestamp on this episode, that is how long the episode is, you're probably like, wait, I thought we got like 10 minutes or something. What are we doing here? And the answer is, this is just an announcement to let you know that I'm actually gonna be taking the week off this week. We did it over Christmas. And what I figured out is that there are four months a year that have five Mondays. And if I take a week off when there are five Mondays, then I get a little more time with the family and then one more time to let people catch up. I've been getting a lot of feedback that people are getting caught up, hanging a week or two back right now. So hopefully that'll be good for the rhythm of things to give you a chance to get up to current, which right now is episode 100. And then next time around, little teaser bonus stuff, we're gonna into Matthew 5.17, which says, don't think that I've come to abolish the law or the prophets. I haven't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. And this pivot point right here is super important because this is Jesus asking the gazillion dollar question that everybody's wondering at this point is in his ministry, that everybody's wondering at this point in the gospel of Matthew is they're reading it for the first time. I don't know, all this kingdom stuff sounds real cool and everything, but we already have a religion and there's like a law and the law explains what we do for sacrifices and for like our stuff and how to make things right when we're wrong other people and how things work out with God and how to government and everything. And it seems like we already have that. And now you're here and you're saying this other stuff. I guess I have a question, Mr. Jesus, is this the same thing or is this a different thing or put another way that makes more sense for how your brain and my brain would process it. What's the relationship between what we call the old Testament and what we call the new Testament and Jesus is going to start getting into an answer that doesn't just deal with the question and make it go away, but then in fact, is one of the most theologically significant, important, profound things in the entire Bible. And if you get what he's starting to talk about here in Matthew 5 17, I honestly think it kind of makes sense of the whole document and it's going to be a lot of fun to break that down. Was that a good enough teaser? Cause I was trying to tease. I wanted it to be like, oh, I can't wait for this week to be over so we can have more of the thing. It's going to be more something that we do all the time. So hopefully that worked, whatever the case, I will be back in a week starting back up again next Monday and less. I just start feeling like I've got more time than I expected and we throw something up in between now and then which I might do. All right, I'm having fun. Hope you guys are as well. We're a hundred episodes in. We're four and a half chapters in. We got a long ways to go. I'm really having fun doing this with you guys. So we'll just keep it rolling and I'll put in a week's worth of thought on what's next. All right, I'm Matt. This was kind of the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and I'll catch you in a week.
