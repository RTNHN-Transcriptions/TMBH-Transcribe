 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Acts. If you made me name my favorite book of the Bible that isn't Matthew, it would be Acts. I did a whole series on the Book of Acts. This is my very first thing that I ever did on the internet back in the day. I did a video series on Acts, like 90 episodes long. It took me forever to get it done. And I was just in love with this book because the historian part of me couldn't get enough of how much this perfectly overlapped with first century history. But the other reason I love this book is because it's the very necessary story of the message of Jesus, the life and the work of Jesus' death and his resurrection actually playing out in the larger world, basically the whole world as it was known at that time in a way that is compelling. It's one thing to come out of the Old Testament and be like, wow, it's crystal clear that this whole God thing is meant for everyone and that the prophets all predict that this is going to go to the ends of the earth and that everybody's going to come and worship the one true God and the God is going to use his chosen people to see this through. It's all there. But what's that going to look like? And now, yeah, you and I live in the age of globalism and mass marketing and everything's connected by the interwebs, but a global religious movement in the first century. A.D. was unthinkable. People didn't conceive of religion this way. They didn't conceive of there being one God who was for everyone with one family of faith. This kingdom, this collection of people that just lays right over the top of political secular history that said acts is the second half of a two part volume by Luke. Now Luke and acts technically are anonymous documents, but there's not really any competing theory for who wrote these two books. Early Christian leaders all agreed that it's Luke, but additionally, there's all kinds of internal evidence throughout the New Testament that says it's Luke. Paul specifically names a traveling companion, a physician named Luke. And if we look at the places where Paul in his letters talks about that guy, it lines up perfectly with the places in the book of acts where the language changes from then those people did that and those people did that to first person language, then we did this, then we did that. That is to say that the author of Luke and acts is present for a good junk of the adventuring in the book of acts. The book of acts has a teeny, tiny, little bit of shaded area of the Venn diagram worth of overlap with the very end of Luke. So it repeats a little bit of stuff. And then we're off and running Jesus ascends to the right hand of the father, but not until he has a very important exchange with his followers. They're all kind of milling around and they're like, well, are we going to have a reckoning now? Are you going to go sort things out with all the people who are awful to you and killed you now that you're back from the grave? Or at least that's what they're in Tony. And Jesus says in so many words, that's not your timing to worry about. We'll sort that out later. But right now, you guys are going to be by witnesses in Jerusalem, then in Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth. And what we get there is one more commissioning for all of the age of the church, all the followers of Jesus. This is your job. Your impulse is to be outward. The arrow doesn't point in. The eyes don't look down with proper Jesus following. The eyes are always up. The arrow is always pointing outward because the message of life is for everyone. And if you have received this beautiful gift of forgiveness and new life and hope, then you got to go give that away to other people. And so that stuff that Jesus says there in Acts 1, 8 Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria to the ends of the earth, you're going to be my witnesses to all of that. That provides a theological trajectory for the disciples and all of Christian history. But it also provides a really helpful outline for the book of Acts, which does exactly what Jesus says. We start in Jerusalem and sort some things out there. Then we move into the larger region out into the Roman province of Judea, which includes Jerusalem, but also up north and to Gentile and Samaritan territory. And then as we move into the third chunk of the book, we see the message go out to the ends of the earth, to Asia Minor, to Greece, to the Italian peninsula. Now, like I have read the book of Acts many, many, many times, but never as much as these last couple of times through in preparation for this conversation. Have I caught how every single bit of every single narrative rhymes with something else we've seen in the Bible, either from the life of Jesus or from the minor prophets or from something that happened in captivity or from Egypt or Genesis, Luke is going out of his way to demonstrate that this story has massive narrative continuity with everything that God has done in the past. And this is not a split off from what God was doing. This is the center channel of that story you've been reading about. This is the resolution to it. And indeed you get two gigantic payoffs to that stuff from the Old Testament, the first of which is this idea of going out to all the nations. And the other big payoff we see is the arrival of the presence of God in a new way that was predicted back in the Old Testament and Haggai in Ezekiel, very memorably in Joel chapter two. It's this idea that that presence of God, who we see in the Ark of the Covenant, we see it in the first temple that Solomon built. And then there are some questions about exactly where it is with that second temple. But the idea is that in the Old Testament, God's presence is dwelling among his people in this holy place. But the prophets start to predict that God's presence will dwell among all of his people, not just confined in a visible sense to a building or a singular space, but this widespread presence of God among his people is going to be somehow indicative of a new and better paradigm in the relationship between God and man. And if you recall coming out of the Old Testament, that's what the story is begging for. We can tell those payoffs are coming right at the beginning. And as early as chapter two, we know this is the way it's going to play out because all the disciples are gathered together and they're waiting around in Jerusalem. Just like Jesus said to do, he said, wait there, I'm going to send my spirit. Well, then he does. They're in some public place in Jerusalem and the Holy Spirit shows up not in the form God's presence took in the past, that being this smoke or this cloud, but in the form of something that produces smoke or a cloud, flames and these tongues of flame as crazy as this sounds appear above the heads of the disciples. And all of a sudden they can speak languages. They theoretically don't know how to speak and all these people from all these different parts of the world are in Jerusalem, which is the intersection of planet earth at this point in history. And they all hear the message of Jesus in their own language and thousands of them on day one are like, yeah, that's the truest, realest thing I've ever heard in my life. I am absolutely in on that. And they become Christians. And from that moment on all the way up to this moment right now, wherever you are, whenever you are listening to this, this thing has been a runaway train. There has been absolutely no stopping it. And people have tried with swords, with guns, with prisons, but this message of the kingdom and the king behind it rings so true and so cross culturally and so cross linguistically that like Jesus predicted, it went from this little tiny seed to grow into this great big gigantic tree that all these different disparate birds and animals can come and take shelter in metaphorically. Well section one, the Jerusalem section is defined by wild immediate growth upon the arrival of the Holy Spirit, but it's also characterized by massive resistance from the same people who just got done executing Jesus. That's kind of embarrassing because that was supposed to go away, but it's not going away now. And they just can't seem to flog their way out of the problem. And eventually a member of Generation two of Christianity, a leader in the church named Stephen gets up and gives this speech that's kind of like second chronicles. He summarizes huge chunks of the Old Testament and it's like, look, we all know the story. It points to Jesus. Why are you people resisting this? And they get real, real mad and they do a thing that they didn't even have the courage to do to Jesus. Remember, they're not allowed to kill people. Only the Romans are the Jews aren't the government. The Romans are the government. Well, they're so angry at Stephen. They don't even care and they drag him out and they spontaneously pelt him with rocks until he dies and standing there approving of the whole thing is a high ranking, very zealous, enthusiastic opponent of Jesus named Saul. That concludes the Jerusalem section of the book. Now we see the Judea and Samaria section of the book where the message goes out further north even into modern day Syria. The roots get put down and Antioch, not Jerusalem becomes the headquarters of Christianity. It's where people are first called Christians. But eventually there's a degree of friction between how these Gentile outsiders and Antioch are understanding Christian faith and how the old school Jewish converts to Christianity and Jerusalem are seeing Christian faith. And they have to have a get together in chapter 15 to sort that through. And ultimately what they decide is, yeah, God's made it abundantly clear. This is for all the nations. They reference back to the book of Amos that you and I looked to straight at a passage right there in the last chapter of Amos that says, once again, this is for all the nations and the Jerusalem Christians and the Antioch Christians. That is the Jewish Christians and the Gentile Christians. They all come together and agree. Yeah, we can't make these Gentile Christians. Do all of the old traditional Jewish stuff. That law is fulfilled in Christ and they move forward as a basically unified church saying, Jesus messages for everyone. There is a new family of faith and we're taking this out to the broader culture. Well, in the interim, two really important things happened. One, Peter in his last significant appearance in the entire New Testament historical record gets a vision from God where God says that the purity laws have been fulfilled completed in Christ and the Gentiles can be Christians. It's for them and you can associate with them and also food is clean. You don't have to call unclean what God has declared clean. That's a huge shift. And then the second big thing that happens is remember that Saul guy who was there supervising the murder of Stephen? He's on his way to round up Christians and put an end to this nonsense on behalf of the religious leadership in Jerusalem. But Jesus shows up and knocks him off his horse and blinds him and he tells Saul, there's no two ways about this. You're going to follow me and you're going to be my apostle and I'm going to use you to reach all these people from all these different places. And somewhere in there, people quit calling him Saul and start calling him Paul. Paul does what he's told eventually regains his sight. Even though everybody's pretty nervous about him in the early going, it turns out it was real and he becomes the apostle to the Gentiles. Well, at that point, the original disciples who followed Jesus around, we don't hear from them as much moving forward. And Paul and his traveling companions, including Luke, become the centerpiece in this third part of the book of Acts that is the two, the ends of the earth part. This section is made up of three great, big, giant missionary journeys where Paul takes an unbelievable beating at every turn. Maybe earlier on, you were like, why would like some guy just goes around and like gives sermons and stuff, need a personal physician. But then you read Acts and you're like, Oh, wow, shipwrecked all the time, getting bit by snakes. He's getting stoned by people until he looks dead, constantly imprisoned and deprived of things, rioters try to murder him. It really doesn't go well from a physical point of view for Paul. Plus he says that he's got some kind of physical ailment, some sort of thorn in his side. Now Luke was very needed to keep slapping duct tape on Paul to keep him in the game as long as he could so he could do all of this stuff. And then in the final section, Paul against a whole bunch of warnings from a whole bunch of people who really care about him decides to go back to Jerusalem to confront his old buddies, his old classmates and be like, guys, look, Jesus is the real deal, but he doesn't even make it all the way through his speech and they try to kill him and then Rome arrests him. And then the last section of the book is Paul sitting in prison for huge chunks of time. And you would think, well, probably not much happens there. This guy thrives when he's out and about doing stuff, but not so even behind bars, Paul is wildly effective in advancing the message of Jesus. Really, whether he's in prison or he's free, he's always operating from a position of political weakness, but he doesn't act like it because he's absolutely convinced of the message that he's carrying out and the greater reality of the king and the kingdom he represents. And that sets quite the tone for the rest of the New Testament and the rest of the era of Christianity. When you visualize the book of Acts, picture fire, when you think about the theme, reflect on the kingdom expanding to the ends of the earth under the leadership of the Holy Spirit. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, and really, this is such a magnificent, sweeping theological, historical epic, I hope you do find time to read it all. But if you don't, make sure to check out the arrival of the Holy Spirit at the beginning of chapter two. Make sure you check out Stephen's speech in chapter seven and make sure you check out Paul's conversion account in chapter nine versus one through nineteen. Alright, I'm Matt.
