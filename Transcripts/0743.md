 Theoretically, everybody knows that stealing is bad. It seems like all societies forever had that one on lockdown. Ahama Robbie's code says you're not supposed to steal stuff. Egyptian law back in the days and you're not supposed to steal stuff. The Greeks thought you weren't supposed to steal stuff. The ancient Chinese thought you weren't supposed to steal stuff. The Old Testament, the New Testament, just generally speaking, this is frowned upon because they think intuitively everybody gets like your stuff, though, hey, it's just stuff and don't hold on too tight on the one hand. On the other hand, it's like, this is the representation of my past labor and my work. Then if somebody comes and steals that, they're not just stealing a thing. They're stealing from what's left of the past decisions and a past version of myself. It's also very destabilizing for society. But that said, we all know there are different kinds of thieves, right? This comes through in books and movies and you watch a story. Sometimes you're watching along and you're like, well, I mean, John fell John for crying out loud. He took some bread. He's going to die. His family's going to starve. He always got that example of the desperate thief who's just trying to stave off death until they can figure something out. That's a lot more sympathetic version, though. Still, they are taking a product of one's past self from someone else. Still, when we see that in storytelling, we tend to be a little bit more empathetic to it. Then you've got the noble thief who is presented as trying to right society's wrongs. This is usually much more complex than the way it's portrayed. But when you see Robin Hood cutting into the decadent lifestyle of Prince John and his stooge, the sheriff of Nottingham, you're like, oh, he's Robin from the rich to get to the poor. Now in that example, Robin Hood remains poor and doesn't hoard that wealth for himself in actual historical examples. More often we see the people who do the redistributing living in the lap of luxury after they've stripped the people who were living in the lap of luxury of their money. And so, yeah, this archetype is a little bit compromised, but still, ideally, when you see that, you're a little more sympathetic to it because theoretically, the Robin Hood archetype of thief isn't getting anything out of the equation. They're just trying to write some stuff that is way off societally, trying to push back on even the abuses of the government. That's compelling. But then you've got the kind of thief who's really just motivated by being depraved and evil and sadistic. Think of the people who confronted the Wayne family in the alley who made Bruce Wayne what he would become. And those are thieves who were just idiots and morally broken. And it wasn't enough to just take things. They were the kind of bandits, the high women who would have cost somebody on a dark road and not just take their stuff, but kill them for sport or enjoyment. We don't feel a lot of sympathy to that type. But then you've got an even more grandiose kind of thief. This is the more sophisticated kind. This is the one who goes and steals nuclear codes. They're James Bond villain and they want to reset the world through death and violence. Even Thanos is an example of someone who went around and stole a bunch of stuff so that though he thought he was right, he could wreak all kinds of evil and havoc. My point is this, thief, bandit, robber, all of these ideas in English mushed together pretty cleanly. If we really tried, we could distinguish between them. They're all people who steal stuff and might be willing to use a little bit of violence if needed. And as a result, when we get to the account of these criminals who are on the cross next to Jesus, the English is a bit vague. They were thieves of some sort. Well, when we come across that word thief, that might conjure a lot of different things for us though, right? And that could create pretty serious ambiguity for us as we try to understand what's going on in this passage. So we got asked the question, well, what kind of thief would the original audience have understood this to be? What kind of thieves would the people who are actually standing there watching this crucifixion occur have understood those two guys on either side of Jesus to be? In the New Testament, we get a few different words that could be roughly translated thief that are floating around and other smarter people than me did this research. So don't imagine for a minute that just off the top of my head, I was like, well, you know, if you just think about it and just remember, as anybody who's read the New Testament in Greek, but no, these are the words. No, no, no, I got a Google stuff. One of these terms is kleptase. You can hear the klepto kleptomaniac. It's built right in there. This is just somebody who's a burglar steal stuff takes things. Like even Bilbo Baggins, who is charming and delightful in his willingness to go and steal from a big mean awful dragon. Back in Matthew six, where Jesus says, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven and not on earth because the treasure is on earth. That's a place where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. That would be your kleptase. That would be your Bilbo Baggins. The person who maybe isn't looking to do violence, but they want to take your stuff. In Matthew 24, when Jesus says the son of man is going to come like a thief in the night, it's kleptase again. Not someone who's coming to slaughter everyone or steal the nuclear codes. This is someone who's sneaky and who you don't see coming. It would have been pretty weird if Jesus had used one of the two other Greek terms that roughly get translated into English's thief in that passage. It would really, really altered the meaning. So another term that we see in the New Testament for thief is harpage. Think of the English word harpoon. I don't know if that's actually a connection, but to me it seems like it would be because this is like one who grabs or snatches or steals away quickly. Maybe more like a pickpocket. Maybe somebody who would be willing to use violence in the act of snatching the Greek historian Herodotus and a few other Greek historians applied the Greekified name harpage to a general of asthijis, the last great king of the Medes. This harpage was, I think he got the nickname because he was commissioned by the last great king of the Medes, asthijis to go and snatch his own grandson who he believed through prophecy to be a threat to his reign. That grandson would turn out to be Cyrus II, the great of Old Testament fame. Harpage famously went and grabbed the kid, but he couldn't do away with the kid. It was just too mean because he wasn't a horrible, violent, awful man, or at least not in that moment. So he passed the kid off to be raised by some shepherds and we're going to talk about all of that a lot more when we get into the book of Esther. There's a famous passage in 1 Thessalonians, which is a letter written by Paul to Christians in Thessalonica where he talks about what it will be like when God collects his people and he uses that same term Harpegas or it would be a different version of that that I'm not nearly smart enough to pull off the top of my head, but it would be the we will be snatched up would be the language there. But then there's this third term used in the New Testament that can roughly translate to Robert and that is less style or less space. And that is the term that is used in this passage in Matthew 27. Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. And again in verse 44 where it says in the same way, the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. This is much nastier in terms of its connotations. This is the word that Luke employs when he's talking about the parable of the Good Samaritan and the people who accost this guy walking down the road and rough him up. This is not your sympathetic Bilbo Baggins or even your likable Robin Hood is trying to write some societal wrongs. This is a violent brigand. This is someone who's completely made peace with the idea of shedding blood to advance their own wealth and whatever they imagine their cause might be. Now it is of course a reasonable question to be like, yeah, but how do we know? You just make it up. What words mean to make the Bible work better? Well, no, the way we know is we go and look at other uses of these words extra biblically as well as looking at them in context biblically and we can figure out how things would have been. Josephus, the first century Jewish historian who was himself a less die in many ways. He was a part of the resistance to Rome. He was the kind of guy who would carry a dagger under his cloak and engage in some pretty ugly stuff. Eventually he flipped sides and suddenly he came to really like Rome and wrote about them in a very positive light. But when Josephus writes about violent brigands and insurrectionists, he uses this term less die, which can be translated into English as thief as a lump term to go along with people who he would openly call pirates or people involved in guerrilla warfare. In light of all of this, I think we can get a better picture than what most English translations can give us here of who these guys were who were crucified next to Jesus and who Barabbas was as well. These were not likable, good-hearted thieves. These were not the rogues with the heart of gold like Han Solo. These were ugly people who were willing to do very ugly things who long ago parted ways with their conscience and service of their own tribe, their own agenda, whatever it might be. These are people who had no problem with shedding blood and it would be absolutely consistent with what we know about when crucifixion was deployed by the Romans in the first century AD that these guys would have received the punishment of crucifixion. Whereas your typical common burglar Bilbo Baggins type thieves would have received a slap on the wrist or maybe a cleaver on the wrist as it were. If we picture Jesus being crucified, this is important because if we picture Jesus being crucified between Danny Ocean and Robin Hood, that conjures a very different image, a very different set of meanings than if we rightly picture Jesus being crucified between people more like an Islamofascist arms dealer, terrorist and someone who goes and carries out some sort of public shooting. I think what we just worked on there is an important detail to help us understand the role of these two guys crucified in terms of Matthew's narrative as well as Luke's narrative and maybe we'll touch on that briefly as we move into the next stuff tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
