 Name My Friends Matt this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and do you remember back at the end of chapter 22 if you've been with me for any period of time but this is your first time here. Hey welcome thank you for being here very much we go straight through the book of Matthew a little bit every single day and we're in Matthew chapter 23 right now working on this series of condemnation's a series of very public denouncements toward the injustice awful leadership and cruelty and missing the pointedness of the religious leaders at the time of Jesus and so there's a series of woes like like these oracular declarations. What do you for this? What do you for that? And we just finished up the third of those woes but all of that said do you all who have been here with me working on this do you remember at the end of chapter 22 when what seems like a pretty level headed Pharisee comes up to Jesus and he's like hey what's the greatest commandment in the law and Jesus says love the Lord your God with paraphrasing here everything you got and love your neighbor is yourself and we know from the corresponding account over in Mark that Pharisee is like yeah right on that's a good answer and Jesus reciprocates that goodwill with like you're close you're close to getting it well in that discussion one of the things that you and I took a minute to think about was just like if you could only ask one question of God and you already knew that there's definitely God he's real he's definitely the first cause he made all the things but you still got all kinds of questions like what does that mean if you had one question let's reflect on this further what would you ask I think some people would maybe ask something philosophical like what happens with this or how does that work or why is there suffering or why is there evil I think those are all very valid questions that all be reasonable but here's another one that I think would be a pretty reasonable question for the person who is pretty sure there's a God and that there is something to all of this but just isn't quite sure what to do or how they fit because of all the mixed messages and life is confusing the world's confusing we're confusing internally it seems like a really honest question to ask would be what is my quest what is it that you are sending me out to do what is my role in this larger narrative that is going on I think I've told you before that one of the strangest emotions that I feel in response to the great storytelling of the last hundred plus years is the emotion I feel in response to the lord of the rings trilogy I still think it's just as good a story as has been written in centuries but in particular I'm compelled by how clear Frodo and Sam's quest is hey there's a ring it's bad it is representative of power and nobody can handle this for very long I think your unique skill is not size or strength or impressiveness or good looks or brilliance I think you're just a little bit more resistant to the corrupting power of this ring than most people are says Gandalf de Frodo paraphrases mine and so because of that one modest little attribute that you bring to the game your quest is as follows take the ring walk to this volcano that's far away throw it right in there that's it it might kill you probably it will but it really needs to happen and you're uniquely equipped in position to do it and you're the one I've picked to do it so go through the ring in the volcano it sounds so simple and I don't know what the emotion even that I feel in response to that is if it's envy or some kind of weird twist on nostalgia or something from the first time I read it I don't know but I want that I want something as clear as Matt you are trash at all of these things like it's nice that you try that's cool and everything but you just you're not particularly good at this other people are much better equipped for this and this and they can play the roles that make sense given their skill set but you're okay at this one little very niche thing and so I'm going to need you to go and do this one thing that corresponds to the little tiny undesirable niche thing that you're okay at oh okay we could just spell it out yes I need you to walk to this place and throw this thing into that thing oh okay it's all so clear but it kind of feels like you don't get that in life it feels like you don't get that from your guidance counselor at school it feels like you don't get that from your boss some people get married thinking like I'm gonna get that from a spouse you don't really get that from them some people think I'm gonna get that from parenthood and say I have kids and I mean you get some direction there but it's not the Gandalf here is your quest this is what you bring to the table go do this thing it's just not that simple and so I guess for me a little bit of vulnerable here as somebody who thinks in narrative and as someone who maybe doesn't imagine himself to be the the hero of some grand story but certainly one supporting character in a story I have some role I'm here for a reason come on the quest I just want to know what do I go do spell it out so if I got to go ask God something if I got to go ask Jesus something it would probably be something like what the Pharisee Glenn asked Jesus at the end of chapter 22 what's the greatest commandment but I think I'd phrase it more like this what do you want me to do if I screw everything else up if I get everything else wrong what is my quest photo if you screw everything else up take that ring throw it in that volcano not that one that one okay Roger ring volcano got it I'm on it Matt if you screw everything else up do this that's what I want now interestingly I think the Bible does actually speak to that it's not it's not catered to you or me but it's in there what we're about to read here is Jesus fourth or rakular woe directed at the Pharisees in front everybody Matthew 23 verse 23 woe to you teaches of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites so we're back to that language no more blind guides you give a tenth of your spices mint dill and cumin but you've neglected the more important matters of the law justice mercy and faithfulness you should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former you blind guides I spoke to you soon the blind guide saying is still there you strain out a gnat but swallow a camel we'll get to what all that imagery means next time around but pretty simply it looks like Jesus is saying to the Pharisees that they are hypocrites because they donate even on their herb garden like one tenth of each of these herbs that I grow in my window in my little bonus garden you have to give that that is the obligation tithing is important and I think biblically that yep it's in there it's important but Jesus says you've neglected the more important matters of the law justice mercy and faithfulness some of you hung around with the bible for a little while are going like oh I know that one that's an Old Testament one I remember that this is a verse it's a really important one you're right it is it's mica six eight this is the verse in the Old Testament that is the Gandalf to Frodo quest verse this is the one where if you read through that whole thing and there's so much Bible before you get to mica six listen to the sound of that thing flopping shut there's that much Bible before mica six you get here and maybe you're a little worn out maybe like I don't know how to organize that narrative I don't understand like I'm not a king I'm not somebody who can approach the king's throne room I'm not a warrior or prophet like what do you want me to do what is my role in this thing and here it is he has showed you oh man what is good and what is the Lord require of you exactly my question what am I supposed to do to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god we don't need to unpack this real deeply that's it it's spelled out let's just go in reverse here to walk humbly with your god oh that sounds a lot like what we've seen all over Matthew the person who is getting it right is not the one who knows the most theology or philosophy or big words or has the most impressive degrees the one who's getting it right in the book of Matthew and really the whole Bible regardless of money or status or knowledge or anything is simply the one who assumes the right posture before the king the one who gets I got a bit part here and you're the hero of the story you're the king of the kingdom and I am some subject in the kingdom and so I bend the knee I walk humbly with god because god is the one who provides all of my needs as is made evident in the Lord's prayer and then we work backwards a little further and we're supposed to love mercy not just like it not just do mercy but love it because it's the central value of the kingdom everything about a relationship with god is predicated on that aspect of his character he is merciful and if he is merciful we're supposed to give away mercy so we should love mercy because it is the branch on which we sit yet there's always the temptation to saw off the branch on which we sit in our unending lust to judge other people wanting mercy for ourselves and not for others working backwards further to act justly they're supposed to like truth we're supposed to do things that are true we're supposed to repeat things that are true and we're supposed to do right by other people in light of what is true not be crooked not be fake not be manipulative not be deceptive if you want to go on the metaphorical quest that is your calling and your purpose in life to take the ring and to throw it in the volcano this is the bible verse that says what to do you assume a right posture before the king you love what he loves and especially you love the thing that makes it even possible to have a relationship with god and to be redeemed from our own mess and then finally you live out the values of the kingdom that are rooted in truth doing things that are just and right with others is that quest always easy no it was taken the ring to the volcano easy you know it was a bit of a difficult trek with a whole lot of hurdles in the way and some tough questions and it didn't always go right but in the end that was the objective and here in Matthew chapter 23 in this fourth whoa Jesus is like you got told what your quest was you got told exactly what it was and rather than taking the ring to the volcano you were like I took the ring to the jeweler and had it shined I took the ring kayaking with me and it was fun I took the ring to a museum where I keep it in a box it's not a volcano but I took the ring somewhere that's pretty good well the response there would be completely missed the point but the ring had to go in the volcano you were told exactly what the thing is that you're supposed to do and likewise Jesus condemnation here is you were told what to do you were given your quest and you didn't you didn't do it you worried about the wrong things and all those wrong things happened to add up to giving other people the impression that you were doing your quest without actually doing the quest I'm so grateful that every now and then in the bible which is a massive book there's this little simple thing that's like just in case you're getting overwhelmed here this is exactly the point do this be this and I think mica 6 8 is as good as it gets and there's something pretty scary for these religious leaders and being told in a credible way like you had that spelled out for you and you just didn't want to do it and that's indicative of where your soul is at we're going to the particular imagery that gets employed in this fourth of the seven woes next time around I'm at the 10 minute bible hour podcast let's do this again soon you
