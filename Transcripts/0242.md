 I don't know about you, but I got two sets of rules I live by. Number one, you always quit after the third hot dog, regardless of context. Number two, only I can punch my sister. Now while the first rule is just common sense, and probably on all of our list, that second rule is probably a bit jarring for you, but I'll have you know, I haven't exercised this principle since I was a little kid. But even back then, my sister and I, we get into it. We just punch each other sometimes because we were rivals and we were children and children punch each other. But let me tell you what, no matter how much we fought, no matter how much we bickered, no matter how much she irritated me or disappointed me, if we go to school and I find out that you are messing with my sister, well you and I, we're going to have a problem. And it's still like that to this day. And yes, I understand the hypocrisy of that. And no, I would never ever ever hit my sister or any girl ever. But you get the point. Likewise in Matthew chapter 11, we got a deal where John the Baptist is in an incredibly difficult situation. He's got this one job to do, which is point people to Jesus and be like, hey, look at that guy. He's great. This is the one who's promised the king who's supposed to come make the kingdom the last forever. It's still on David's throne and straighten everything out and blind. It's supposed to see in the lame kin. I got to make sure I get the straight walk and the mute can talk and the dead are coming back to life. He's great. Like in the good way of coming back to life, not in the zombie rotting flesh way. But John, despite having this one job and despite all of those things happening is under arrest. He's facing his imminent death. He's no doubt wanting to make sure on his way out the door that he threw his energy behind the right thing. He's looking for reassurance and John's disciples show up in front of a lot of people. Maybe John was imagining that this would be a little bit more subtle and you can just like pull Jesus aside. But the text here of Matthew 11 indicates that there was a crowd there. And so they show up and then like, well, John told us to ask, excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt. We're representatives of John the Baptist, the guy wears the camel hair and eats bugs and stuff. Yep. You guys all know the one. So sorry, you can get back to your thing in just a minute. We just had a question for Jesus on behalf of John. Are you the one who's promised or should he be waiting for somebody else? That's what he wanted to know. And we just needed to get an answer to that literally right now in front of all of you. And so then Jesus replies in a way that needs to point to the fact that he is the king or it's going to mess with these crowds and confuse everybody. He can't afford to be delicate with it. And so as we discussed yesterday, he responds, like, okay, since this is so urgent right now, paraphrases mine, you just go back and tell John what you're seeing here. All the things that are supposed to happen when the Messiah shows up, they are happening. And then probably the people in the crowd is the disciples of John walked away. Idiot. We follow the right person. We follow Jesus. John, that was like something that was popular like a year ago. Things were so stupid back then. We're so 2008. They're so 2000 and late. But before John's disciples are even gone, Jesus flips it around in the same spirit of, hey, only I can punch my sister, which I'm against. Nobody punch your sister. You understand the illustration? I'm sure there's no punching. You can't punch your sisters at all. And it says, as John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. Hey, why did you go out into the desert to see a reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in King's palaces. Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you. And more than a prophet, this is the one about whom it is written, I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you. I tell you the truth. Among those born of women, there's not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing and forceful men lay hold of it for all the prophets and all the law prophesied until John. And if you're willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. He as ears, let him hear. And if you've hung out with me for any period of time and you know the pace at which we move out, there's no way we're going to break down all of that today. But what I want to look at is that, hey, only I can punch my sister's segment. He just got done in front of everyone, maybe in a conversation he didn't want to have publicly. Jesus just got done saying, go back and tell him he's not thinking straight. I know things are difficult, but he's wrong. All the things that are supposed to be happening right now, messianical or happening right now. And then I really do imagine the whole room starts to get a little bit smug and he flips it around and he asks these rhetorical questions. And I think they're so juicy. Hold on a second. Before all you start giggling about how dumb my cousin is, let's just pump the brakes here. Connie and Karen and Deb and Roger, didn't I see all you guys out there in the desert? Like a really, really long walk from here. That would have cost you a lot of money to get there, right? And a lot of time, that must have been time off of work. What was that? Your whole vacation, Roger? Yeah. So you hiked out there and you got baptized. I mean, you seem like a pretty smart guy, Roger. You didn't drag your butt all the way out there to go and see somebody who's like a read that gets blown this way and that way in the wind because he's fickle and he doesn't know what he's talking about. And he can't read the signs for what they are. I mean, you thought he knew what he was talking about when you made that trip and when you had him baptized you, didn't you? Yeah. I see you laughing over there too, Deb. That's pretty funny, isn't what I just said to Roger. But Deb, you didn't go out there into the desert to see somebody dressed in fine clothes, like a king, right? I mean, you didn't hike all the way across the country in the searing heat because you thought you were going out to see an authority figure who could just snap his fingers and decline. You didn't go out to see somebody who was in charge of everything. You went to see someone who was subservient to things and predicting something, right? That's what you signed up for? Okay. So before we all get a good laugh, let me just say you all knew what you were signing up for. You went out to hear from a prophet and you heard from a prophet. And so before we give into the temptation to start looking down our noses at my cousin who paved the way for me, let me just reset things so we don't embarrass ourselves. You all went out to see a prophet. You got a prophet. No, but I want to tell you this. My cousin John is more than a prophet. My cousin John is the one about whom it was written. I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare the way before you. And obviously when Jesus says stuff like that, he's always quoting someone from the Old Testament before we run and break down the passage that he's drawing on there. And this is real quick. Address the fact that I've had some of you were kind of uncomfortable with the tone that I took there with Jesus. And you're right. That is crazy excessive paraphrasing. But I think the sarcastic nature of the tone is very present in the text. He could have cut to the chase and just been like, no, John is very important. Okay. Easy now. He asked some reasonable questions and yes, it sounds like I pushed back on him, but he's a very important prophet. But Jesus himself, who the text holds out as being infallible and right about everything, decided the best way to communicate this would be to point out, I think, the hypocrisy of the room in saying, hey, why did you sign up to follow John and show an interest in what he was about in the first place? Because you thought he was a fraud or fake or silly or something to be made fun of because you thought he was legit. And then what I think Jesus does is he flips it around and affirms their first impulse about John, which was, hey, you read it right in the first place. You're right. This guy is a big deal. How big a deal? When we jump to the Old Testament. Now, the last time Matthew sent us to the Old Testament in reference to Johnny, took us to Isaiah 40 and verse 3. Back in Matthew 3, he quotes this verse where it says, a voice of one calling, in the desert, prepare the way for the Lord, make straight in the wilderness, a highway for our God, and every valley shall be raised up. And there's a lot of that language about the kingdom and everything getting straightened out. But this time around, Matthew quotes Jesus not as going to the well-known passage in Isaiah chapter 40 that the audience would have really had down, but to another one that people would have remembered, which is Malachi 3. Now, for the original Jewish audience, this one would have rung a little bit differently because it draws on a later prophet, the imagery of Elijah, and likens whoever this forerunner is to that character. You can see where this is all going. Malachi 3.1, see, I will send my messenger who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly, the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant whom you desire will come, says the Lord Almighty. Then we skip through some stuff just because of time, and we jump over to chapter 4 on the next page in Malachi. And here it wraps up saying in verse 5, see, I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, or else I will come and strike the land with a curse. So you got this thing that is lingering out there as that verse wraps up. You want me to read you the very next verse that happens in the Bible? There's the very literally the next verse after that promise about this messenger that's supposed to come who is in some way Elijah. The next verse is a record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the so on and so forth. Look at that. The way the canon of the Old Testament and the canon of the New Testament mashed together is incredible. Now admittedly, for the original audience, Matthew wasn't the book yet. The Bible, as we think of it with the New Testament, wasn't put together yet. But Malachi is the loose end that's just flapping around in the wind and all of their brains. There's something that's coming. There's a next thing. History isn't over. God isn't done with us yet. And there's some Elijah or Elijah-like character who was a pretty crazy wild man in and of itself who's going to show up and usher in the next thing. And so when Jesus, we're going to skip ahead just a little bit here, says, and if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. He's completing the narrative rhyme. They all would have known it even if they might not all have necessarily believed Jesus correlation between John the Baptist and Elijah. It was true, but he rounds it out saying, Hey, you as ears, let him hear understanding. Maybe not everybody is going to buy this, but according to Jesus, it is reality. It is truth. So we start out with the situation where John sends his disciples to ask a question. It looks like there's a little bit of division in the family ranks here. Jesus knows that they're embracing a negative view of John and he's like, well, hold up, hold up, hold up. He is legit as a prophet. And in fact, he's the prophet of prophets. He is the completion of Elijah. And in the same way, Matthew was setting up this idea that Jesus is the new Moses, creating this new nation, this new family, this new kingdom of faith. Well, there's also apparently a new Elijah here who is pointing the way toward this truer, greater thing. And that's John the Baptist. If you've ever had a sibling and you were like, I can beat all my siblings and we can fight in rough houses, kids, but don't anybody from the outside pick on them. I will defend them tooth and nail because I understand their value. If you get that, I think you get what's going on here in Matthew chapter 11. A map is the 10 minute Bible hour. I really appreciate you and I look forward to doing this again soon. Thank you.
