 You and I have seen a lot of resurrections the last few years, not the kind where actually people who were dead come back to life, but like fiction on screen resurrections, especially over the last decade or so, since we ran out of all the ideas that existed that could work for storytelling. I think what's happened is, one, we've exhausted a lot of creative ideas, and two, the constraints we're putting on ourselves in terms of what story could all of planet Earth with all of their different religious sensibilities like? Well, none. So it really limits what you can actually do or what themes you can tap into. And so, resultantly, I think you and I would agree that we've seen a whole lot of retreads and rehashing and pulling old characters out of mothballs, characters who had a really good story arc and went all the way through that story arc. And then maybe the story arc ended the way everybody's story arc does, which is with dying, but now there is time travel. There's magic space wizard. The wizard did space magic and then the time and then they came back and now they're back and now they have a new quest. And the new quest is, of course, slavishly crammed into whatever the immutable ethics du jour are this week. Then the whole thing adds up to these resurrections we keep these characters brought back from the beyond. This just makes them really unsatisfying and it also very much builds up this emotional immunity to the idea of a beloved character coming back to life. It's more of a hold your breath and then are they going to ruin it this time around kind of a response that we're conditioned to have now. And I think because we're in this weird little moment of storytelling where we don't really have new ideas and we are doing these gross resurrections with all of these old characters, it might be tempting to encounter Jesus here in Matthew 28. We see him on screen for the first time since he was like straight up dead. And imagine that somehow what we're getting is like a cameo or a reboot or to anticipate that sort of nostalgia Barry payoff that you're supposed to get from modern storytelling. But the difference between the creatively bankrupt pseudo resurrections we've been seeing lately on screen and what we're getting here. Well, the obvious one is that this holds it out as actually having happened like I was dead and then he came back to life. But I think the other big one is that the stakes are so different. The stakes for what you and I are seeing in our storytelling right now is like, will this company be able to turn in a better quarterly report and will their stockholders be happy and will people on YouTube make videos that are flattering of these shows or not? Whereas here it set up so like the whole fate of the universe hinges on this. And so if Jesus comes back to life, it's not like, oh, I enjoyed it so much when he was on screen. I'd really like to get some more Jesus action. That was such a fun rump. It's much more so like if Jesus comes back on screen than the seal of death and separation from God is broken and everything that I thought I understood about the universe in a negative way is actually wrong and there's actually hope. And it is interesting as we work through the Bible to see that sometimes the bias we have to overcome or the hurdle we have to overcome is that we just don't get naturally the cultural mindset and environment that we're reading about from a couple thousand years ago. But other times the hurdle we have to overcome is that we're so ensconced in our current mindset that it becomes easy to inflict that on the text. Well, the thing that jumps off the page to me and what I'm about to read you in Matthew 28, eight is how relatively understated Matthew's account is here considering how big a deal it is. And then Rachel just said, Hey, and you're going to need to tell the disciples to go into Galilee. I have spoken paraphrases. Mine verse eight. So the women hurried away from the tomb afraid yet filled with joy and ran to tell the disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them greetings. He said they came to him clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, don't be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me. Isn't it incredible how much isn't here? Now we know from Luke and Mark and John, there's a whole lot of other stuff that I've referenced a little bit and we're going to talk about a lot more going on in this sequence of events, this chaotic moment where everything the followers of Jesus had hoped for actually comes to fruition. But Matthew just gives us the lightest touch. We get one word of, Hey, we're back together. Good to see you. Remember I was dead and missed you so much. Greetings. You are way better Greek than I am. The good way to treat this in the original language is to be hail generic. Hey, I guess Matthew's thinking here is that the quality of this event and the implications of this event speak for themselves. We don't need some gigantic spike of the football from Jesus. We don't need a bunch of nostalgia here. We don't need all kinds of hype. He's alive. That says everything that needs to be said. And even as Jesus is formulating the next instruction, the women respond the way effectively everybody who gets it right responds either verbally or physically throughout the entire book of Matthew and really throughout all of the gospels. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. I think these ideas are connected. All he does is show up and say, Hey, which I mean, being able to utter one word and even the physical act of being able to stand there means it was all true. Now you know. So what is the right response to that? Okay. Well, I guess there is a kingdom. I guess the kingdom does have all those values that you said it had all the way back from the very beginning, the Sermon on the Mount. And I guess you are indeed the undying king, the king who was promised to David, the one who's going to reign forever, the one who's going to crush evil and straighten everything out. I think it was crystal clear to these ladies before me. Their behavior indicates as much. But since now it's not even really a question. It's abundantly obvious that it's all true. The only thing that makes sense is to fall at the feet of God and king and to seize the moment and the opportunity. I mean, how many humans in this physical life get to interact with the maker, the one who is present and fully participatory in creation and the sustenance of creation. So they're going to seize the opportunity to do that, to be worshipful in the presence of the truest, realist thing ever. But we've seen other people get it even without the benefit of a resurrection and they've responded similarly. And I think about all the way back in chapter two, you have these magi, probably intellectual descendants, cultural descendants from the same tribe of people in Persia. Daniel was a member of and they see a star and that's enough for them to be like, yeah, our math tells us. This is the one true king. This is the truest, realist thing. And we're going to take a gigantic cross country journey that's going to cost a ton of money and we're going to give a whole bunch of gifts to a kid in a manger and we as elites, probably part of the ruling council, the noble court of Parsis or whatever is left of this transitional Eastern Persian empire, which exists even beyond the full grasp of Rome. We're going to come and pay homage to this little baby king. They see him for who he is without the benefit of him coming back from the grave and they assume a right posture before the king. Then you think about coming off of the sermon on the mount and everybody's like, jury's still out. Great speech. Can you back it up? And what happens right away in chapter eight, that leper runs right up to him, falls at his feet and assumes a right posture before the king. And Jesus touches him. I mean, you can't touch a leper, but clearly this is an affirmation to everybody else around as well as to the leper who's fallen at his feet to say, yeah, that's right. This guy gets it. He is assumed a right posture before the king in chapter nine. Matthew, at least metaphorically assumes a right posture before the king. If you're going to say, Jesus is like, I'm blowing off all of my stuff and we're having a party and I'm inviting all of my weird friends and it's the religious leaders who cannot bring themselves to assume a right position before the king. And then just right after that, you've got that leader who's like, yeah, my daughter just died and he assumes literally a kneeling position before this king without the benefit of yet having seen resurrection. Now everybody's walking around with Jesus post chapter nine. They have seen somebody come back from the dead. So I suppose they do have the benefit of resurrection or many of them do from this moment forward, but still people who don't even have eyes and couldn't see that resurrection. They assume a right posture before the king. These blind guys at the end of chapter nine, they identify Jesus and they're calling him the son of David and saying have mercy on us. They understand that he's a king. They understand that he's the king even Peter and the disciples after the walking on water incident effectively bow down before him and acknowledge him as king as if they haven't seen enough already. But then a total outsider again, without the benefit of seeing any resurrection in chapter 15, remember the Canaanite woman way up north. You know, I think this is such a huge important little moment that is often overlooked that falls right at the middle dividing line of the book of Matthew. She comes up to him and again, she calls him the son of David. She recognizes him for who he is. And she also comes up and kneels before him, assuming even as a political ethnic outsider, assuming a posture before a king that makes no sense unless she gets something that most people at this point are still missing. If you go over to the book of Luke, you see this everywhere as well. Luke was very, very interested in demonstrating that the people who see Jesus for who he is fall at his feet in worship. They understand that he is a king that goes beyond the normal boundaries of kingship. But here we are. Last chapter of Matthew and the point is being driven home again. There's no longer any question in Matthew's mind. He feels he's made the point clearly enough that you as a reader should be able to say this guy, he is indeed the king and the women are indeed assuming a right posture before the king. That's a huge payoff because this whole book of Matthew, the whole thesis has been the story of God and everything that happened before going all the way back to the crazy ancient, almost pre history stuff that gets described in the first 12 chapters or so of Genesis that can just leave you scratching your head. It feels like we're talking about a different world, a different universe, but still even that far back into the shadowy beginnings of long, almost lost history. There's still all this stuff that points to Jesus. And then as it starts to take clearer form with Abraham and the patriarchs and then Moses and the events of the Exodus and then the judges and the kings and the exile and the prophets and even through the silent period of Alexander and the Roman conquest, everything as Jesus says, effectively in Matthew five is pointing toward the culmination of this kingdom with a true king and Matthew is saying, is Jesus? He's here. That's the guy by the time we get to chapter 28, Matthew is writing like a man who thinks he has made his point. He thinks the evidence makes it abundantly clear to the audience. He is targeting that Jesus is the king. You got everything you need. These ladies, the centurion, these outsiders, they can see it. They are assuming a right posture before the king. Matthew's implicit question is, hey, future reader, will you? And remember, at this point, we've still only got one little word from Jesus, but the fact that he can speak even that one little word, the fact that he can even stand there to be worshiped is more than sufficient in Matthew's mind and in Matthew's reporting to say, and I think that gets it done. This is the real king. I find that compelling. I'm in. I understand that some of you don't and you aren't. Are you still thinking about what to do with the gauntlet that Matthew is throwing down? But one way or another, at the very least, from a literary perspective, we have to acknowledge that that's compelling, that that's brilliantly crafted and put together. And I say again, I'm in. I've seen what I need to see. I'm Matt. I'm going to Bible our podcast. Let's do this again soon.
