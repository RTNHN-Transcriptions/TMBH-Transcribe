 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and we've talked before about how you got a heart language that's the one that you were raised on that you think in that you feel in. But I would argue that you also have a heart currency. This is whatever money you were raised around. I might sound crass like, oh, you know, money's gross and it makes me feel icky and that's just for buying stuff and money's not real, but money, it is kind of a big deal because it's the way that we commodify goods and services and the value of our times, the way we easily trade between things of different value. And because of that, whether people like money or into economics or not, we all kind of know what a buck is worth, what a pound is worth, what a euro is worth, whatever your currency is, you sort of know what increment will get you how much along the way. But it gets really weird when you go to another country where you don't really understand the currency and your brain, you always have to be like, okay, I have to divide it by four and then add two zeros. And then I mean, if you're not doing that math perfectly every single time, somebody could cheat you out of a ton of money because it's just confusing. It's not natural. It's not native to you. Likewise, I feel like we are travelers to a foreign country. We haven't really visited before when we make a serious effort to understand the Bible and this theme that is all over the teachings of Jesus, all over the Bible in general, and this is this theme of money of real value and consistently throughout the Bible. There are examples of human currency, human value being compared and contrasted with lasting value, God value, kingdom value stuff. Jesus talks about money, stuff, possessions, value, commodity, currency, more than any other topic in the Bible by my own count. I went through and did the math except for talking about his father and his father's kingdom. That was his favorite topic, his second most commonly touched on topic. It wasn't like sex or politics or people being nice to one another's value. It's currency. It's money. So it's a big deal in the Bible, but we are tourists when we go and read the Bible because none of us are Roman in the first century, Roman sense. I know that some of you are literally from Rome and that you listen and you know who you are and you know that I like you. Hi, thanks for listening to the podcast. Additionally, none of us are first century Hebrews. None of us are first century. Anything. We the 2000 years apart, economics has changed, currency changed, everything's changed. So we're doing a currency exchange in our brain all the time whenever this subject of value comes up, but in the same way that it'd be really easy to get that exchange wrong or sideways with the math and get cheated out of a whole lot of resources when you're traveling. So if you get it sideways in your brain, when you're doing the conversions, reading Bible stories that hold themselves out, it's having like transcendent eternal meaning, it'd be really easy to get cheated out of the meaning. If you do the math wrong or you end up in a weird place, now I'm not saying we're going to do the math perfectly today, but what I want to do is try to get in the ballpark of what kind of actual value we're talking about in this parable of the talents in Matthew chapter 25, because understanding the parable is at least somewhat contingent on having a sense of the magnitude of wealth, the magnitude of investment that the master is putting in the hands of each of these three servants. So real quick, again, the parable of the talents is in Matthew chapter 25, it starts in verse 14. It's about this guy who's going on a journey and he brings his servants in and he's going to trust them with some property. He gives one five talents of money and other two talents and another one talent each according to his ability. That's a key detail. So the size of the investment corresponded to the master's evaluation of the skill set of each of these servants. Then he went on his journey and the man who received the five talents turns around and he makes five more than when he received the two turns around makes two more. The one who received the one kind of goes into panic mode and he just buries his master's money. The master comes back. It's like, I let's see how that went. The guy who got five was like, check it out. I got five more in the master's like, awesome. Come to my house and share in my joy. And then the one who got the two is like, I got two more. The master's like, that's also awesome. Come to my house, share in my joy. And the one who got the one is like, I don't know about your character. You seem kind of shrewd weird. I don't necessarily know that I trust your character entirely. So I played it safe. I figured you would just want the coin back. I buried it. Here's your one coin back with no return. And the master's like, wow, well, wow. I mean, it's weird to me because if you knew that I am the horrible monster that you say that I am, you would have thought you'd at least like throw in the bank and get like that point three percent interest or whatever garbage they give you on checking right now. So you could at least show me that you buried it. Wow. Wow. So just it almost feels like you're making excuses. All this paraphrases mind almost feels like you're making excuses because your behavior doesn't even square with who you say you think I am. Whatever it doesn't matter. Like throw them out. We're done with this guy and take his resources and reallocate that to somebody who knows what to do with resources. Sounds a little harsh. There's a lot to break down here. But that is the story. As you can see, it's pretty hard to understand the story or to fully grasp the implications of the story. If we don't know what we're talking about money wise because what the heck is a talent? Well, I'm glad you asked because this gives me the opportunity to use the Bible that I got when I was a kid, which has very limited resources for once. I get to flip all the way to the back here right next to the maps. Yep, there it is. There is a page, just one page. And it is titled and kind of fancy calligraphy tables of weights and measures. I just go right to this. And ha ha, it's the very first one, biblical unit talent. American equivalent, it says of a talent is 75 pounds. Now, thanks to a little research using books and the internet, I was able to figure out that talent doesn't mean the same thing in every single culture that you look at in the ancient world. As we have talked about a lot in our conversations, there is a compressive effect to history where we see history in dramatic relief with all of its little nuance and details the closer we are to that history. So every one of us could tell the difference between the styles of like five years ago and the styles of 1995 and just look at it and be like, oh, well, just look at I don't know just the way the genes are you can tell it at 195 and ones like right now, we can tell the nuanced difference in political language during the Biden era versus the George H. W. Bush era in the early 90s. But you go back a couple thousand years or the further you go back in general, and the more it all kind of lumps together. And eventually it lumps together so much you're like, yeah, you know, you know, like Greece and Rome. This is how the things were back then with them, you know, they were with the different hats. It is a fuzz on the top and some whatnot. And they got the strips of leather and rocks they bang together, you know, Greeks and Romans. It has a compressive effect. So when we talk about talents, we do have to ask the question, okay, which talents? Now the Babylonian talent looks like it was one of the heavier talents. And this came in somewhere in the maybe low 70s, 72 pound range, a talent in the Old Testament looks like it weighed a little bit more than a Babylonian talent like in the distant Old Testament. So maybe you're talking like upper 70s. There are a few people who make the case for a Hebrew talent that weighs like almost the body weight of an average person from back then. So like a buck 20 or a buck 30. I don't know. I haven't seen a ton of substantiation for that. And then it looks like the Roman talent would have been the lightest weight of all of the talents. And that maybe came in at 60 pounds or just a touch under that. So let's throw out that crazy heavy version that isn't as substantiated and will kind of land in that 70 75 pound range. Let's just play it safe. And we'll just go with 65 pound is kind of a working average between the Babylonian talent, which is way East and the Roman talent, which is way West. We're talking about things that are halfway between East and West and Jesus world. So you can kind of see what I'm doing there. There we go. 65. I'm just gonna write that down. 65 lives. So we got 65 pounds times 16 ounces in a pound. I'm going to ounces because I know the value of metals better announces. So that means one talent would weigh 1,040 ounces. If this is a talent of silver we're talking about, then let's just make that $25. That's about the spot price of silver today according to app mix.com. And that takes us to about 20,000 bucks modern value for one talent of silver. 26,000 bucks for one talent of silver. If we assume that it was absolutely pure. Okay, I'm writing that down. All right. But now that first guy, he got five talents. So that would be 130 grand. All right. So if we assume this is silver and that the silver is pure, then the first guy got 130,000 bucks handed to him and told like, Hey, you should be able to do something with this much money. It takes money to make money. So go make some money with this. That means the second guy got handed what 52,000 bucks in terms of modern money takes money to make money should be able to make money with that. But what about the poor guy who only got one and who the master wasn't really nice to and didn't trust as much. He still gave him 26 grand. Go my goodness. It takes money to make money in 26 grand. Like you can make money with 26 grand. It's a ton of money. That's brain melting money to me. But hold on, my friends, let's just like for the sake of the exercise. Let's just, I mean, does it really spell it out for sure that it was silver? Does it say it here that it was silver? I mean, I'm not seeing it for sure that it says that it was silver. Right. I think I'm assuming that. What if it then gold? I mean, it says money. I don't know. Let's just run it with gold real quick. What I say that it was, we got 1040 ounces and we're going to multiply that by spot price of gold is about $1,980 today. That means a talent of gold. Oh my goodness. Is 2.06 million dollars. I don't know. Let's multiply that by five. Wow. If it was gold, he was given this guy 10 million bucks. Am I doing that right? That is so much money. That is just bonkers. It takes money to make money. You should be able to make money with that. I assume it was probably silver. But still, this is mind melting. But here's another thing about all this. Now you and I are talking about the same thing. We're talking about 65 pounds being one talent of, let's say, silver. Just think about how much it would take to even move that around. There was energy even in the investment. Check this out. I'm going to put the microphone down here. This right here is one ounce of, I didn't have an ounce of silver handy. This is an ounce of copper, which is worth like 30 cents maybe. Okay. Ready? Listen to this. That's what that sounds like. You could hear that, right? Okay. That's one ounce. Now check this out. I did have a little bit of silver here. This is going to clank a bit, but you're going to be able to hear the weight. This is one pound of silver. Like actual physical pound. Ready for it? Wait. Ooh. A little more thump to that one, right? That's only one pound though. Like a talent of silver. 65 pounds. That's what we're going with. Okay. I had to go and dig this up for the sake of this exercise. What I have got right here, this is, let me see. This is a hundred ounce thing of metal. And that's so 6.25 pounds. Here's what that sounds like. Oh, that's a lot. Like that takes effort. I can feel that one. All right. Now right here, I have a weight from my weight bench. This one's 25 pounds. I think I just about broke my table. I'm going to drop it on the ground so you can hear it better. Oh, did you hear that? That's only 25 pounds. That's less than half of a talent. So just think about receiving 65 pounds of precious metal. And then your thought with that is like, you know what? I'm going to dig a hole. I'm going to get it down in there. That's your best strategy right there. Just think how much effort it would take to get that even in the ground. That is a lot of investment. And that really is all I wanted to communicate. That's all I wanted to work through with you today. Is we're not talking about a few bucks or a quick loan or something like that. We're talking about really meaningful money. This is a massive investment, a massive gesture of trust. It's also a massive expression of vestedness that in effect is the master paying the highest compliment even to the least qualified of these servants and being like, Hey, that kind of weight in value. I'm going to give you a crack with that. Go see what you can do. That might be intimidating. That might be a little bit scary, but also like, Hey, you're in, you're a part of the team here. You have a role to play in my household. And as we talked about before with the language of servant and master and all of that stuff that comes up all over the book of Matthew and the gospels in general, I culturally everybody who heard that would have been like, dang, that kind of vestedness in a household and a household that good and that benevolent and that lasting. That's like the best that anything could be. So hopefully now we are just that much better position to appreciate some of the nuance in Matthew 25 and understand the behavior of the characters a little bit better as we unpack it more. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
