 Thank you for getting dinner. I'll be right up. I'll be right up in a minute. I have to talk to the Internet about phylacteries. Hey everybody, it's me, Matt. It's the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. I hope you're having a beautiful day. We need to talk about phylacteries today because that is a word that happens in the Bible, particularly. It happens in Matthew 23, verse 5, and then there's other stuff related to that that goes on through 6 and 7. And yesterday we were talking about this part of the Bible where Jesus is calling out the version of religion that the Pharisees are putting forward to the people. And Jesus is holding himself out, is doing a very different version of this whole thing, the right one, the more meaningful one. And in doing so, the criticisms are getting enormously specific. So yesterday we talked about the big picture, theological, contextual motif, completing business surrounding this little passage. But today we're going to talk about some of the specifics and look more closely. What is Jesus actually criticizing here? And is he criticizing all the Pharisees for getting this wrong or something broader? So this is a passage we're looking at. Matthew 23 starting in verse 1. We'll just rewind to there. Then Jesus said to the crowd and to the disciples, the teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. So you must obey and do everything they tell you to, but don't do what they do for they don't practice what they preach. They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for men to see. They make their flactories wide and the tassels on their garments long. They love the place of honor at the banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues. And they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them rabbi. And before we get into the end of the specifics of this, you might be like, man, that's so nitpicky. He's getting after their outfits and just how they wear their religious stuff. But that seems a little bit excessive. But then any given culture, things that might not mean something in a different culture communicate a tremendous amount, including humility, modesty, aggression, arrogance, pride, superiority, whatever. And I remember when I was a kid, I had a pair of blue jeans and they were starting to wear thin anyway. And I was like, you know what? I want some of those really super cut up jeans, like the people from CNC music factory or faith no more wear. And so I cut them up a whole bunch over at my friend's house one time. And I had like 30 cuts up and down the leg on each side of my jeans and I scruff them all up. So it would look like they just got that way naturally over time. I don't even know what happened. I figured that's probably what color me bad told their parents and it probably went over just fine. And I went home and dad was like, take them off. I mean, I just got whitey tighties on underneath. We didn't have to take them off in front of me. The weirdo, but you had like just take them off. We're throwing those away. You ruined perfectly good jeans. We're not particularly well to do family that you're not wearing that. And I was like, why? I am asserting my independence here. This is important to me. And that was like, I don't like what it communicates. Whether you agree with his assessment or not, dad felt like that thing that in and of itself doesn't have any moral value one way or the other. Maybe it has less utilitarian value because cut up jeans are probably not as effective as cut jeans for the practical purposes of jeans. But socially and immaterial, the meaning of that, it's kind of agreed upon and I see exactly what you're doing there. So as we get to know a little bit more about this flactery and tassel situation that we run into in Matthew chapter 23, it just got a picture of something that you look at in society where you're like, oh, it's just a little fashion thing. It's just a little body language thing. It's just a little style thing. It's just a little thing that you put on your car. It's just a little thing that you do on the internet, but stuff means stuff. And that's a signal and we all know what that signal means. And maybe it rubs you the right way. Maybe it rubs you the wrong way. Well, Jesus saw them doing something with their flactories and he knew dang well. It's given him to judge the nations. He knows all the things he knew dang well, what it meant. And he's going to call the thing out. The word flactery is Greek. I don't think it's Hebrew. It's like flactery on. It's one of those when you take your Greek class, you're like, oh, that one's super easy. You just sound it out. You decode the Greek. Like even I can do that one and remember it. But what I didn't see common when I first got taught about that word by people way smarter than me is that it has connotations in the classical Greek of almost like an amulet of protection, like some kind of warding trinket. I don't assume, but definitely do not actually know this for sure. The term flactery, the Greek word there got picked up in the Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures, what we call the Old Testament in Christianity that is called the Septuagint that predates Jesus by a couple hundred years. It was the Bible that was in circulation at the time of Christ. And I bring up the Greekification of that word because I think it's kind of important to note what got picked up in translation there because I'm not sure that's exactly what the Old Testament text is talking about when it describes this stuff in Deuteronomy and Exodus. Now, it occurs to me, we still haven't actually even talked about what a flactery is. It's a box or a pair of boxes, one that you wear on your arm and one that you wear on your forehead. It's a literal interpretation, a literal expression of these instructions that happen early on in the book of Deuteronomy and in the middle of Exodus, like Exodus 13, where you get this instruction that you're supposed to take the word of the Lord and bind it up and put on your foreheads, put it on your arm, or like keep it close to your heart. And so quite literally what evolved was this practice of making these boxes of certain dimensions where certain scriptures specifically Deuteronomy 6, 8, Deuteronomy 11, 18, Exodus 13, something and 13, something else like the first half of chapter 13. All of these four passages get written out in a very precise way with a special kind of ink on a special kind of, I guess you call it vellum or parchment, an animal scan, a kosher animal scan. There's like a kosher way to do a flactery and there's like a special type of leather strap that you use to fasten the flactery, the sealed box with the little tiny scrolls of scripture in there to your forehead and to your arm. And the one that goes in your forehead is divided into four boxes with each of those four passages that I just mentioned a second ago being tucked away in there. And then the one that goes on your arm and is worn like on your bicep close to your heart. That one has just all four loose in the box. And interestingly, if you go poke around on the internet for this, you will not usually see the first century Greek word that Jesus is using here, flactery, bandied about on the YouTube or different websites that give you instruction on how to do Jewish things or observe Jewish customs. There you will see this referred to as Tefillin, but it's a reference to the same stuff and a reference to the same parts of the Bible. So here's a quick sample of what those passages read like that would be included in a flactery or a Tefillin Deuteronomy six. I marked it. I can't actually turn there that quickly on my own. In verse eight, tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates. I think there's actually more to that one, but that kind of gives you the just Deuteronomy 11, 13. So if you faithfully obey the commands I'm giving you today to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, then I will send rain on your land and it's season both autumn and spring rain so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and oil. I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle and you will eat and be satisfied and be careful or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them. Then the Lord's anger will burn against you and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce and you will soon perish from the good land the Lord is giving you. Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds. Tie them as symbols on your heads and bind them on your foreheads. Teach them to your children talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you get up. Then the other two passages are over in Exodus 13 and I have that Mark 2 it looks like 1 through 10 is the first passage and then it divides there and 11 through 16 is the second passage from Exodus 13 and there you get a lot of the same language about it bind this to you internalize it hold tight to the word of God but there's also reminder language there about what God did in the Exodus and leading you up out of Egypt. So it's kind of a covenant reminder. You can kind of see how in the context of first century Greek magic culture which is the thing we've talked about in the past here that there could be kind of a meshing of this concept of warding off evil warding spells. You still see that manifesting in the Middle Ages with gargoyles are supposed to keep demons away and even vampiric lore and things like that. It's always kind of been on the fringes of the Judeo-Christian tradition and I think it kind of makes sense that it is on the fringes because there are promises in the text about God working good things and doing good things and particularly there are covenant promises between God and the chosen people that happen in the Pentateuch in books like Exodus and Deuteronomy that kind of set up the narrative trajectory of the Old Testament as we've discussed that is about that playing out of the mosaic covenant where God's like I'm going to be God and you're going to be my people and if you obey me everybody's going to know that I'm God because I'm going to bless you and if you disobey me everybody all the other nations are going to know that I'm God because I'm going to punish you. All I'd say I get how the critic could look at this and say oh Jesus is calling them out because they are adopting, they're synchronizing true belief in God with Greek magic beliefs and maybe there's something to that will probably unpack that more tomorrow as we get into what the actual nature of Jesus critique is here and unsurprisingly just like anything else in any culture like blue jeans or haircuts or anything there's always a way to do a thing that everybody does to put your own little spin on it to draw attention to yourself to do it with modesty and humility and hopefully we've got enough of a groundwork from our little conversation right here to set us up to break down what Jesus might be in toning was wrong with how they were flactarizing tomorrow in such a way that we can get closer to the heart of Jesus critique here so that we don't go through all this stuff where we're getting to know Jesus and then get to chapter 23 and just be like oh he's mad about a ton of stuff and we just feel free to extrapolate all of his remarks out into any kind of judgy rule system that we want to now if we read the thing wrong we're going to make the exact same mistakes that he seems to be criticizing here so as always we're going to take our time we're going to think about it carefully try to put ourselves in the shoes of the original audience understand as much of the stuff that means stuff as we possibly can from their perspective and then hopefully understand it better than we would if we just did the quick version of it. So more of that tomorrow thanks for hanging out with me I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon.
