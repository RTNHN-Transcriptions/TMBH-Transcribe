 Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and I need you to picture somebody you love, but not just love. Somebody you also admire and look up to someone who is invested in your life, maybe a mentor, maybe it's a parent, but maybe that one person who isn't a parent who has most taken you under their wing and taught you things about life and nurtured you and been there for you when things were difficult and dispensed wisdom to you. Are you picturing that person? Awesome. Now I want you to picture how much money you would need to have them killed. Let's give you a second to run that through. Right you probably came up with no amount of money would work for me to have them killed because of how much I love them. You can't give me enough money to have people I love killed and I think what kind of sick psychopath are you and that's hurtful, but fair question. Well in this episode of your beloved 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, we are going to try to figure out exactly what that number was for Judas Iscariot. So here's what we got. Matthew 26 gives us some starting point figures here on what Judas was going to need to have Jesus his mentor somebody supposedly loved someone who would invest in how much it was going to cost to have him killed. If we got Matthew 26 starting in verse 14, then one of the 12, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and asked, what are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you? So they counted out for him 30 silver coins from then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over. That's not much of a negotiation. Sometimes like Judas walked in ready to pull the trigger on the deal and there wasn't really any back and forth. He's like, what do you give me? And the way Matthew reports it, the religious leaders are like, this much. And Judas was like, sweet, that's plenty. The thing about it this way, how do you feel when you're trying to buy or sell something on the Facebooks, maybe a car deal or something and you're trying to work out the number on something that you kind of want? You're like, okay, I see you have $10,000 on that. I'll give you 9500 and they're like, awesome. Yes, deal agreed. I mean, your brain immediately goes to this place of crap. There was way less that I could have paid for that. I, I bid too high to start. I should have bid way lower. That's kind of what this negotiation looks like to me. Judas comes in and like, what are you willing to give me? They count out 30 silver coins and Judas is like, yes, sweet. I mean, we're the religious leaders after that. Like, dang it. We could have got that for 20 silver coins. Totally would have bit, whatever. So we learn a little bit just from what we hear about how the negotiation went in terms of what Judas's actual bottom dollar was. I think he would have done it for less than 30, but in our quest to find out what Judas is, I will sell out my friend and mentor to death number is. We're going to give him the benefit of the doubt and start at the number he actually arrived at, even though we fully acknowledge that he didn't negotiate at all and happily accepted the number that was initially offered indicating he would have gone lower. Next question that we got to answer in our quest to find out Judas is all murder. Your number is what kind of silver coins are we talking about here? Probably only two things that would be possible at this point. You're either talking about denarius, which theoretically the religious leadership wouldn't use in an ideal world because we know from the Jewish historian Josephus that these same religious leaders melted down at exactly this time in history toward their new governor, Pontius Pilate over some shields that had the image of Caesar who claimed to be a God. Those shields got too close to the temple. That was unacceptable. They melted down over some banners that had images on there that were of Caesar who claimed to be a God. So now that wouldn't work either. We've got it easily three documented examples of these exact dudes saying we will go to our knees and put a knife to our necks and kill ourselves in public ritual suicide at your governor's palace in Caesarea, maritime is where that happened. If you do not take away this affront those images of Caesar are blasphemy and idolatry but we also know that just a couple chapters earlier they were like, well, should you pay taxes to Caesar? Remember they were asking Jesus that? Jesus was like, give me a coin. And they're like, oh, yeah, sure. I got one right here in my pocket. Oh, whose picture is on it? Well, Caesar gotcha. So the idolatry thing was the kind of deal that apparently these religious leaders worried about when it was expedient, but when it involved money that they could use to be rich, they were maybe a little more willing to overlook that in that example because they had one right there handy, but Jesus did not. So again, theoretically, we would not be talking about denarius here. We would be talking about shekels, but these were strange times and the religious leaders were very low commitment. I mean, these were political stuges, not much in the way of high integrity, highly principled leaders. So maybe they made this offer in denary, but maybe they made the offer in shekels as well. It was a pretty significant silver content and therefore value difference between these two currencies at this time. And as you and I have discussed before, the denarius is a little bit of a moving target in history because the Romans were always messing with the silver content and also the proclaimed governmental announced value of these coins. Those are sort of two different kinds of value. If you think about it, the silver is worth something. But whatever the government says is price fixed. This is what it's worth. We said so. And all that assigns a value as well. And both of those I suppose really come down to whatever people are willing to pay for it. But fortunately, we have this magnificent empirical, testable physical record of exactly what each and every Roman emperor did with their currency. Well, we got coins from this era. Who's in charge during this era? Tiberius. And we know that the emperor Tiberius did a couple of interesting things with Roman coinage. One, he is one of the very few emperors who took steps to bolster the metal value of the coinage in circulation. He kept the denarius, which is the very basic unit of Roman currency like the dollar is in the United States of the pound in the UK. He kept it at 3.9 grams total weight, but he increased the silver content from 95 to 98 percent to 97.5 to 98 percent. So in general, he raised the basement, the lowest allowable silver content for a batch of coins, just a little bit. And in doing so, effectively increased the metal value, the actual value of coins during his reign. So that's one thing that Tiberius did with coinage. The second thing that Tiberius did with coinage is he called him in. He called in 675 million denary. You'll recall a denary is representative of a day's wage for the longest time. It's been pretty easy to do math with because we can just say a hundred bucks is a day's wage, maybe given the ludicrous levels of inflation that we have seen of late, it would be better to think of a hundred and twenty bucks as being what a day's wage should be calculated as now. I think for my purposes right here, I'm going to stick with doing math with a hundred dollars a day just to keep it easy. So Tiberius did that, he used legal means, he used force to reclaim all of this coinage and bring it back to himself. Why was he doing it? Well, long term, what happened was that old coinage got largely melted down and reissued under successive emperors, most notably Nero, who gave the coins back to people but reduced the total weight from 3.9 grams to 3.4 grams. And then also reduced the silver content Nero did from 97.5 to 98% all the way down to 93.5% silver content. So this is the old saying about like the don't pee on me and tell me that it's raining, but sometimes the government just does that. And here Nero did that, but Tiberius did not. Nero gave people back these freshly minted coins and was like, look, it's so valuable. It's just like the other ones, except now it's shiny. He actually stripped it of value and used it for his own vanity projects. Whereas Tiberius, I'm not sure what he was going for with that 675 million denary collection, but he did slightly raise the value. And that was the value that would have been in fresh circulation at the time of Jesus at the time of Judas is scary it. So I feel like we've got some figures we can operate off of. But quickly, I think it's worth noting again that when Jesus says give to Caesar, what is Caesar's? He's not just making an isolated esoteric comment. There are a few chapters earlier. Yeah, we've talked about the theological value of that comment and what he's driving at. We've broken that down very carefully. But you got to remember that the big economic news story that everybody was aware of was that Caesar wanted his coins back, not just in the form of taxes. Like at any given time, Caesar can just say, it's not a tax. I'm collecting back all of my money and I'll use all kinds of different means. Some scrupulous, some unscrupulous to do so. And that's just happening because it has my picture on it. And I'm the one who gives it value and I'm in charge of everything and I am a living God. And if I want to collect my value and my image back to myself, I will do so. The original audience then back there in Matthew 22 would have been very aware of this gigantic economic news that was unfolding as everything was going down. And Jesus went right there. And I think that only helps us to flesh out the point he is illustrating all the better. Caesars can fiddle around with value and tinker with percentages here and there. All they want, they can call in their hoard. All they want, but real actual value is declared by the God who is God over the Caesars and God over all things. We're halfway to our answer of what Judas's number is for what he'd need to be paid in modern terms to sell out a mentor or somebody he loved toward death. I think this is a fascinating exercise. And next time around, we will get into the details of the value of those shekels and those denarius and run both scenarios to try to figure out how much he got paid. And this is not just because it's fun though. It is fun. We're also doing this because we're trying to understand the story and the original audience. They would have known they would have had a number in their head that was like, wow, 30 silver coins. That's so much. He's rich or they would have had another number in their head and they would have been like, really 30 silver coins to sell out your mentor to death. I don't think I'd do it for that. Now we're going to figure out which way they would have thought about it and it's going to help us understand the story better. And then we are going to move forward. I have mentioned now, I don't know, three, four times, some new friends I've made on the internet. They're the people who have the pour over. It's an email newsletter where they do a great job of just thinking about whatever is going on on planet Earth in succinct, just the facts, ma'am ways that it's incredibly helpful. And it's all set against the backdrop of kingdom values. I think it's really helpful. I've got great feedback from those of you who've checked it out. They did not pay me to tell you this. We kind of just got to know each other. We're like, hey, we should tell our people about each other because I think this is good. And so we did that over the last month. And I'm really, really glad and I hope you enjoyed the pour over. So that sounds fun. You can go and check it out at the pourover.org. And this concludes my little tip of the day for something that you might enjoy. Thanks for being willing to think about Dangent Roman and Jewish currency with me to try and understand the Bible better. You all are real cool. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
