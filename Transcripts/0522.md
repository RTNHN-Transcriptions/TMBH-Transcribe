 The following story is real because it actually happened and this is completely true, not joking. I was in Frisco, Colorado and probably like, winter of 2005. I'm going to say that was about it. And I was on a road trip with a bunch of friends and we were at the A&W parking lot there. Don't know if there's still an A&W there or not. And we're all hanging out in the parking lot and one of my friends wanted to go in and get something. And I was like, Oh, here, you know, I'll get it. So I tossed her my wallet and she took it and went inside and bought the thing, came right back out. And as she's walking toward me with my wallet that she wants to return, I just held my right hand up. I think I'm getting all of this right. I held my right hand up and I kind of made this Rasputin eye contact with her, like throw it to my hand, throw it into my, you throw it directly into my hand, my eyes say to and says she goes to throw it into my hand, but she missed by the country mile and it came up way short is down by my foot. And while maintaining this Rasputin eye contact with her, I just flicked my foot forward and perfectly kicked the wallet, which then spun rapidly directly into the hand that I never moved in any way. And I just kept making eye contact like, yep, I could do that again and again all day long because that is totally a thing I can do. And if I'd left it at that, it would have been the most legendary thing ever like the coolest thing I've ever done. But this little voice inside my head was like, yeah, that was really cool. But you need to look over there to see if everybody else saw it because it's only sort of cool if just one person saw it, but it's super cool. If everybody saw it in this other little voice inside my head is like, don't do it. It doesn't look cool. If you look over there, because then everybody can tell that you care. It has to seem like you don't even care that that just happened. Then it's legendary. And I wrestled with it for a minute, man, I just couldn't help it. I had to go and look at everybody else. And I looked over there with my eyes up like, did you guys see that? Do you guys see the thing that I did? Like the puppy tail wagon and everything. And they were like, yeah, yeah, it was cool. But in their hearts, they were like, it would have been a lot cooler if you hadn't looked over at us. You got it. We're humans. We all want to share our cool glories with each other and get whatever little bit of even goofy social cred that we get out of those kinds of victories that happen in life. And I think that's cute and harmless when you're talking about sports or board games or just bumming around with friends or whatever, something quirky happens. And that's great. That's how you get to have war stories with friends. And it's awesome, but it's tacky and it's gross when it happens to church. When you take things that are supposed to be honest and intimate between you and God, then instead you kind of flipping around and make sure that everybody noticed. So you get like some Jesus bucks, the mind of everybody else and religious credibility with them because look, look how good religioning I am. It's gross. Then if you've been around church, you've probably at some point succumb to the external or internal pressure to play that little game. And if you're anything like me, that goes in that bucket you keep in the back corner of your brain where you lodge all of the grossest, most not self-aware, embarrassing memories that you have. But if you can relate to that kind of, oh, I sort of want other people to see that I'm good at Christianity or religion impulse at all, then hey, at least you're in good company. Because I think a lot of us have probably inadvertently or advertently bent the knee to that impulse a time or two. And that's not a new phenomenon because when we're in Matthew chapter 23 into this section where Jesus is rebuking the religious leadership of the day, one of the things that he calls them out for is performative religion in front of other people. And he's suggesting in the passage we're going to be looking at today that the way people did some age old religious activities really betrayed the fact that the religious activities were all about them. They were all about pride and that it was gross. So as we get into this text, at first it's going to sound a little bit weird in terms of what the stuff that Jesus is singling out actually materially is. But you just got to remember this stuff means stuff and in any given culture or even micro culture at any given moment, there is a thing that you can do that shows humility or class just because of the agreed upon ground rules of what is normative and what means what. And there's another thing that you can do that would demonstrate not class and pride beyond the really overt ways to demonstrate pride and superiority. There are also all sorts of little subtle ways to just twist the knife and just remind people of what their place is and your place is. Well, apparently there was such a micro culture here in the first century in Jerusalem amongst the religious leadership and the people who observed the religious leadership where you could do certain religious activities in a way that demonstrated humility. You could also do those exact same religious activities in another way that demonstrated unending pride. So in Matthew 23, I'm just going to pick it up from verse one, even though we already kind of looked at the first couple of verses. And Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, the teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses's seat. She must obey them and do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do for they don't practice what they preach. They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves aren't willing to lift a finger to move them. Now we get into the new stuff. Everything they do is done for men to see. They make their flactories wide and the tassels on their garments long. They love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues. They love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them rabbi is not hard to see what the accusation is here. He's saying your religious leaders are frauds. They love their positions. They love what they get from these positions and everything they do is done for men to see if they're praying and keeping with what Jesus said about prayer all the way back in Matthew. What is that? That's got to be six. Yeah, six like the conversation we were overhearing the other day between Pharisee Jeff and his good listening friend, Mike, the prayer that Jesus is criticizing in the sermon on the mountain. He says, when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they've received their reward and full when you pray instead go into it quietly and discreetly. He's banging the same drum there. The difference is that in the sermon on the mount, people didn't really know what to make of Jesus yet. The Pharisees weren't exactly sure why he was a threat yet. And the sermon on the mount, Matthew chapters five, six and seven starts with there are a bunch of crowds and Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down as disciples came to him and he began to teach his disciples. The Pharisees during that speech are just bystanders at the fringes of the conversation and listening in. And I'm sure that they picked up on like, oh, like that's, yeah, that's exactly how we pray. Then I'm sure quietly they were muttering to themselves like, we don't do that to impress men. That's nonsense. We're just very, very, very good at prayer. And if people happen to be inspired by that, well, then I think that's just a little bit of bonus that comes from our quality individual spiritual lives that just happened to play out in front of lots of people. So I say again, it's not hard to figure out what he's doing because Jesus has pointed out this problem before. What's unique about what we're getting now in Matthew chapter 23 is that it's in front of everybody and he is naming the exact people who are getting this thing wrong. And he's doing so at their home base. This is a willful intentional attack on their authority. And he is absolutely trying to call who these leaders are into question in the minds of the people they influence, which brings me to a fork in the road. Do we go and talk more about flactories and how all of that works or do we go and look more at the Bible context? We're going to do more of the Bible context because as I was sitting down and getting ready to do this thing, I was like, oh, this reminds me of that, that one other verse from another one of the gospels where the teaching is about like, if you go and you're sitting at like a table, you should not go and try to scramble for the seat of honor. Ooh, that's going to be a really good connection. Which one is that? I did a bunch of flipping and digging around. I was like, come on, I've been over that recently. Where is it? And finally, I found it. I'm like, oh, it's in Luke 14. I'm so good at Bible people on the internet are going to be so happy with all of my hard work that something catches my eye over here in the margins of the Bible that I'm reading from right now. And there's just a note directly right next to this that says Luke 14 is like a passage you should go and look at because it talks about the same thing. So I perhaps don't bring as much value to this relationship as I sometimes like to imagine that I do. But let's go look at that passage anyway. In Luke 14, Jesus is eating in the house of a really important Pharisee and he gives a bunch of teaching in there. And one of the things that he says is verse seven, when he noticed he being Jesus, how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable. And this is an oft forgotten one, but it's a good one. When someone invites you to a wedding feast, don't take the place of honor for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. If so, the host who invited both of you will come to you and say to you, hey, give this man your seat, then humiliated, you will have to take the least important place because the implication is that'd be the only one that's left. But when you're invited, take the lowest place so that when your host comes, he will say to you, friend, move up to a better place than you'll be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted ah ha. And thusly this little nugget, this little portion of this public rebuke that we're looking at today in Matthew chapter 23 comes more into focus in terms of the motifs that this is drawing on. It's not just completing the theme of don't pray like a punk and public and don't do all your religious stuff to impress people. It is also playing on that theme of first will be last last will be first that came up so much just a few chapters ago before we got to Jerusalem. And so in Jesus mind and for the attentive audience member, this rebuke about these fancy religious things, the flactories and sitting at the places of honor and being greeted in the marketplace and having the title and all of that business, it is meant in the mind of the reader and in the mind of Jesus who is saying it to be connected to this first last last first motif, meaning that your value and your standing, your station in everything is a product of a God you could never actually truly please by your own awesomeness because this God has an unlimited reservoir of awesomeness and any awesomeness you could produce anyway would ultimately be a credit to said God because he made you and all things. If you understand that God is the maker of all things and that he's the king of everything and that you're not the humility is it's logical. It's also shrewd. It's the only thing that makes sense. It's the only play that makes sense. So then if that is the only response to the nature and character of God given who we are that makes sense, it would indicate then that the Pharisees don't understand the nature and character of God. So in the same way that I kicked a wallet into my hand and thought I was pretty awesome about it and I had the option even though I thought I was awesome inside. I could have just left it inside. I could have just I could have just left it at that. I didn't need to say it. I didn't need to act on that impulse about my misconceptions about my own greatness, but I couldn't help it. My goodness. Can I relate to these Pharisees this public rebuke that they are receiving is meant to be a cautionary warning to the rest of us who are not thankfully named in this rebuke. And I think if we're reading this right, given the context we've jumped around and looked at here, it's not just like a don't act cocky. I think the fuller cautionary warning here is when you are so confident in your own awesomeness that you are absolutely fine with that leaking out in front of everybody to impress everyone with just how religious you are and just how lucky God is to have you, you probably don't even actually understand the God you're talking about at all. And this is sad and dark and lonely and embarrassing place to be in. Thank you for spending time with me. I appreciate you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
