 I would like to think that this thing has been pretty fun, right? Maybe we laugh about stuff, theoretically sometimes, you know, it feels like you're not supposed to laugh about some of the stuff that we've laughed about because it's a Bible and it's important and maybe part of the fun of this happening in this kind of medium where we're just on the internet, we're hanging out or whatever, you can be more like normal people. We can have practical plane conversation about this kind of stuff, also thinking about it really deeply and clearly taking as much time as I want to to go through it at the pace and focus level that I feel like, which has been great. That said, I mean, from time to time, there's just been stuff that has come up in the text that hits me in such a certain way that it is hard to maintain that tone of goofiness that I enjoy and that makes me feel socially comfortable. And this might be one of those topics because this is where we get into the passage where Jesus really starts to take the physical abuse. I know that there are a bunch of you here for whom Jesus is a compelling and interesting character and that's about as far as you'd be willing to go with it right now. Cool. I can respect that. I really genuinely, I mean, we don't talk about like my religious devotional life very much in these conversations. But I have one and I think I maybe got there in kind of weird ways, but I am. I think really, really highly of Jesus of Nazareth beyond highly like I think of somebody else. I think the same thing Peter did. I think he's the son of God and he's a Christ. I think he's the Messiah. I think he alone has the words of life. And I've tried to make this podcast the kind of thing where it's not all just one like big persuasive sales pitch. But instead just, I don't know, I kind of want to see if we could talk about the thing at a deep, honest, maybe even at times, intelligent level and look at the details together regardless of our convictions or where we land on the thing. And I think we've pulled that off pretty well, right? It's been fun is my point. I guess what I'm driving at here is that I have to ask for your patience with me over the next few conversations we work through this because it's kind of a somber thing for a Christian to reflect on the punishment and the indignity that Jesus endures right here in the heart of the events that directly lead to his death. Thank you in advance for rolling with me on that. So here's what we got. Matthew 27 verse 26, then he, that's Pontius Pilate, released Barabbas to them. So all of the religious leaders and the people they whipped into a frenzy say they want Barabbas and Pilate's like, fine. Okay, whatever. I already washed my hands of it. So I'll do what I said. But he had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified. It's funny because when you have crucified on the back end of flogged, it makes the flogged thing seem like not that big a deal. Like it's a little warm up or something and not maybe of great concern, like a passing note. But of course, for you and me, if you got flogged this afternoon, it'd be a day you would never forget the rest of your life. That would be one of the biggest, most shameful, most physically taxing or deals that most normal people would ever go through or even imagine going through a flogging has a long history. It means different things in different cultures. At this point, we've got enough in the way of extra biblical and biblical sources to reestablish what was going on here. We know from a bunch of that stuff that I've referenced before, from Justinian who went back through several hundred years later and reorganized Roman law and looked at old Roman cases, including punishment methods and so forth. We know that flogging was mostly used for people who did exactly what Barabbas did. It was for insurrectionists. It was for people who committed treason. It was for people who killed others in the carrying out of these anti-state exploits. And the flogging was meant to send a message. All of the Roman punishment was really meant to send a message. Their punishments very much corresponded to different things. They didn't just inflict the same kind of pain on everybody. We're going to talk about that more tomorrow. But the flogging thing in particular was meant for what Barabbas did wrong. And so right from the get-go, the original audience would have been familiar with which punishment is for which kind of thing. And they would have read this and they would have been like, dang, Barabbas got let go. And Jesus takes literally, literally the punishment that was awaiting Barabbas that very day upon himself, as we've discussed, is very much in keeping with a central theological theme of Jesus and the New Testament and the whole Bible and the sacrificial system of the Old Testament. But the whole thing about the mercy of God, which is perfect in the justice of God, which is perfect, it demands some really unique solution. And the unique solution is God taking on flesh and there being a perfect sacrifice for all time, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. And that is Jesus. So this idea of substitutionary atonement, inarguably, it's in the Bible. We've talked a lot about these verses before. 2 Corinthians 5, 21, he made him, he being God, him being Jesus. He made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in him. 1 John 2, 2, and he himself is the propitiation for our sins and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world. A little bit later in 1 John, in this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation, substitute the payment for our sins. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life and Christ Jesus our Lord. In John 10, Jesus himself specifically says that he's the good shepherd and the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. And then very famously, a verse that I've referenced off the cuff, a jillion times in our conversations in Mark 10, where Jesus says the son of man didn't come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. And there is so much more, but that gets you the idea. The reason that I did that quick run through on just a small sampling of verses that demonstrate that Jesus was laying down his life as a sacrifice for sin is because it's become a little bit fashionable of late to sort of poo poo that notion amongst some Christian circles. And I really think it's the kind of fashionable where it's like, well, that's what they taught us when we were kids. And now we're adults, we're more sophisticated and so we're more interested in maybe these other aspects of what Jesus was doing there. We're all like that, right? No hard feelings with anybody. But the reality is that this idea of what theologically is called substitutionary atonement that is atonement for guilt, not carried out by the part of the guilty person, me, you or Barabbas, but carried out by Jesus in this case, who is not guilty and he takes unjust guilt, guilt that isn't his upon him. That idea of substitutionary atonement is just all over the Bible. He can't not. It's so thick. Jesus himself, as we just talked about, says it a lot. Now that is not to say that there aren't other elements to what happened at the events that we're looking at right now and that we're going to come upon in the crucifixion here in just a little bit. There certainly is a moral example of kingdom values and submission to the will of the father and laying down one's life for his friends. Jesus also says that stuff. There certainly is the idea that the stronghold of evil is defeated in Jesus' death and resurrection, that the power of Satan over the world is pushed back, that darkness is thwarted as a result. There certainly is the notion that this is a consummating event in the kingdom and that the kingdom is realized in new ways when Jesus dies and his resurrection. That's all there. But thickly, thickly from beginning to end of the Bible, the idea of substitutionary atonement, Christ as a substitutionary sacrifice for the sins of humanity, it's just there and it's inarguable. And frankly, it's right here in this one little verse about flogging with Barabbas. Barabbas gets released when what he was facing was a flogging for being an insurrectionist, a traitor, a murderer, a person who commits treason. And immediately the very next thing is that Jesus gets the punishment that was meant for Barabbas. I don't think that's just a passing detail in the text. I think it's one that would have been more likely to pop for the original audience than for us, but it's recoverable for us. And it is a theological point about what is happening here. It's emblematic of the theological exchange that is occurring. More on this darkest part of the book of Matthew next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
