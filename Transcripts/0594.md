 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and for a long time, I used to teach college history at the University of Nebraska at Carney, at some community colleges, at a liberal arts college, and they were all fun. I like history. I like the students. I like that academic environment. And for the most part, it's just an awesome experience. But one of the things that I discovered was that there were some pretty shocking knowledge gaps for kids coming out of high school at that point when I was doing that. And I suppose every professor instructor has something that they get all fussy about. I'm not letting these youngsters get out of my class without knowing this. I had to learn it. You're going to have to learn it. This is important. And I think it sounds like it's all dumb and bad and fussy to be that way. In reality, I still think this. There are certain things that students need to learn if they're going to be given three credit hours of college credit and a given subject. And so when I taught American history, I would always do extra credit quiz questions where I'd kind of try to get a feel for what the incoming freshmen and even the sophomores knew or didn't know. And pretty early on, I realized, oh, wow, there's some huge knowledge gaps here in terms of American government and the history of the evolution of our government and how that all works. And maybe one of the most shocking, how can you not know moments was a couple of weeks before the election in 2008. That's the one between McCain and Obama. I just simply asked the students as an extra credit question, hey, give me the name of the presidential and vice presidential candidate for both the Democrat party and the Republican party and less than half of the class, all of whom are eligible voters and reported that they would be voting, less than half of the class were able to do that. Just barely half of the class were even able to name the presidential candidates on either side. And some of the answers that just blew my mind that actually I think are kind of funny. I hope they were trolling, but I don't think they were trolling. This one kid said that the Democratic candidate was Brad Obama, oh, apostrophe, capital B, Obama, you know, the great Irish leader, Brad Obama. And then somebody put for the Republican ticket, they said, John McLean, I think in a reference to maybe die hard and quote that librarian stripper lady. And it was after that answer that I was like, okay, we got to change something here. And so I instituted this. How can you not know part of the curriculum? I was like, look, in order to get three college credits in American history for me, you have to be able to pass the citizenship test that immigrants coming to this country have to pass. Like you're taking it for granted. Like you just, you got to know kids. And maybe that sounds crotchety and old and grouchy. But at some point there are certain things that you come across in life where somebody doesn't know it or you realize you don't know it. And you're like, dang, how could I not know? How could you not know? And I feel that way, but for a different reason when we get to Matthew chapter 24 and Jesus gets done laying out all this big complex description of roughly how things are going to look as we move toward the culmination of events and all the signs that point toward his return. And then he gets done laying all of that stuff out and he's like, this is true. My words will never pass away. But then he says in verse 36 of Matthew 24, no one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven. And at that point, I'm like, Oh, wow, this is super top secret. Like only God knows and Jesus is God. It's like the Trinity they know. But then he goes on to say, nor the son what? But only the father. And I'm like, how can you not know? I thought Jesus knew all this stuff. How does this work? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like the Bible screams this notion that the father and the son and the Holy Spirit, like this is the Godhead historic Christianity holds to this position. I mean, there are a few expressions of Christianity throughout the ages that don't. But overwhelmingly, this is what Christians believe about Jesus. And I don't know when people pray to Jesus seems like they pray like he knows all the things and it seems like as we've been reading through Matthew, he's always so many steps ahead of everybody. It seems like he knows all the things. I mean, how many times have we read passages? You and I going through Matthew where it's like Jesus knew what they were thinking. He knew what was going on in their hearts. Well, how did he know that? Well, that's because he's God. Then we're completely a piece with the idea that, well, because he's God, he was able to detect things that normal people can't detect. But here he is describing a limitation. Whoa. So I asked the question again, then I also asked of my students back in the day and that I sometimes ask of myself, how can you not know? But once we get past the initial shock of Jesus acknowledging that he doesn't know this and start to think about other things, he said, begins to come into focus. He's already made it crystal clear that he's going to die. And if you can die, it means you're vulnerable. If you bleeds, it can die. So if you can die, you're limited. And also he prays to the father. So it means that he needs something outside of himself. He's always deferring to the will of his father. His father has to show up at the baptism in chapter three and give him his blessing. Jesus probably could summon food and angels and anything else to help him in chapter four when he's going through the temptation, but he looks limited there. But if he could call and help, but he didn't call and help, it means that how can you not know is voluntary? He cannot know because he's choosing not to know because he's limited himself. Well, apparently the early Christians wrestled with this as well, but not so much as a point of theological contention. Like what's the deal with Jesus? What do we do with that? But more they wrestled with it because of the example Jesus set in voluntarily submitting himself to some of the ground rules of planet earth while he was here. And in doing so for the greater cause of his role in the redemptive story that is run through all of the Bible and that culminates in his work at the cross and in the resurrection. In doing that, he demonstrates this ludicrous level of humility, serving people who are beneath him and submitting to things he's not obligated to submit to. And so in the letter to the Philippian church, which was written later on by the Apostle Paul who we haven't met yet in the book of Matthew, we get a bunch of language here with Paul grappling with Jesus, apparent choice to limit himself, at least during his time on earth. Listen to what he says here again, this is a devotional character exhortation for Paul's audience, but it's drawing on the example of Jesus in his decision for how to interact with or restrict his own knowledge and ability and power. It says, if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like minded, having the same love being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility, consider others better than yourselves. At this point, you're like, I mean, that sounds good, but I don't know. I'm pretty good at some stuff and all people are proud, aren't they? This is begging for is the letter was being read aloud to the church in Philippi. It's begging for a, yeah, that sounds nice, but why should we do that? Well, here's why. Verse four of Philippians two, each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others, your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus. Ah, that's why because Christians named after Christ Jesus, this guy who founded the religion, he's in charge of the whole thing. His example is the one that sets the pace. Now listen to what Paul goes on to write a record here about the nature of Christ. Who that is Jesus being in very nature, God did not consider equality with God, something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross. Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. At the most basic level, what we're seeing here is acknowledgement that Christ is God in very nature. He is God says that right up front, but also we're acknowledging there's some kind of distinction within God within the Trinity between the Father and in this case, the Son and that somehow they're doing different things in this process, even though they're of the same essence, they're the same being. And apparently according to Paul, it was Jesus role to embrace this humble role in the redemptive process, submitting even to death, which is way below his pay grade and even a super shameful death for a vile criminal in the case of a crucifixion. But then what Paul seems to be alluding here is that God the Father exalted Christ brought him back from the grave, whatever the mechanics of that was. And this somehow confirms or makes evident to everyone that Christ is Lord and that everybody is going to bow and that everyone on heaven and earth and under the earth and every tongue will confess that Jesus is the Lord. So with that little passage from Philippians in our hip pocket, we go back to just a second I missed it. Let me turn the page back to chapter 24 and verse 36. And now we read this again in light of that. No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven nor the son talking about himself, but only the father. So when we read this verse and we can't help but instinctively ask the question of Jesus here, how can you not know the answer would seem to be because I chose not to know and because there is a degree of deference on the part of the son to the father. And that is part of the interplay within the Trinity and the plan for again, according to the end of Philippians two and that passage we were looking at, the ultimate acknowledgement that Jesus is Lord, all to the exaltation of God the Father. That gets us towards some pretty heavyweight Christian theology and bigger things. But hey, if the text takes us to an easy place, we go to the easy place. And if the text takes us to a more difficult thing that points to larger questions, we'll have to tackle later, then that's where we go. Because those are the ground rules of going straight through book of the Bible and just seeing what we get tomorrow. We need to think more about the implications of Jesus not knowing the exact day or the hour and what that means for everything he just said. And what that means for those of us who are reading it now. Thanks as always for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
