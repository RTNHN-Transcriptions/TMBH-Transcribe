 Did you ever see the clip of Samuel L. Jackson maybe like 10 years ago or something he's going around promoting movie don't know which one and he's on a morning show no doubt Samuel L. Jackson at this point had done a hundred appearances on every dumb show promoting whatever movies next snakes on a plane whatever it is and the host of this show who is a white guy and that maybe factors into the conversation here clearly starts talking to Samuel L. Jackson as though he were Lawrence Fishburn he just got him confused and come on you're smart there could easily be perceived a racial undertone to making that mistake at the same time I'm a white guy who sometimes gets one white actor celebrity confused with the different white I mean it just happens so I have no idea if this poor host is some kind of super angry flaming racist or more likely just some guy who made an honest mistake and didn't do his job very well that day and didn't prepare for who was coming on the show but whatever the case he humiliated himself and Samuel L. Jackson who is razor sharp and quick on his feet was not going to let it slide so he just starts bad during this guy and it's so uncomfortable and maybe you could watch that and be like man Samuel L. Jackson's a jerk why would he get after this poor dude just made an honest mistake it's a valid take but also you could look at it and say I think he's got a legitimate gripe I mean just from a journalistic perspective you should at least know the name of the person you're about to interview or things they've done you just want to double check that and to from a fame perspective I mean this is the highest grossing box office actor of literally all time so you kind of hope that somebody would recognize him and then I'm making no comment on this one way or the other but also is you know you've got potentially you have racial undertones or questions that might exist there as well and oh it was amazing in Matthew chapter 10 Jesus is implicitly expressing a bit of the same indignant sat might not be exactly the right way to characterize it we'll look at it together you can figure out what words better for people not recognizing him as king he is sending out the 12 disciples in this big long thing that takes up is it all of it I think it's all of 10 yeah all of Matthew chapter 10 called the missional discourse second great big speech of the book of Matthew and in this missional discourse he's like hey here's what you're going to do you're going to tell people about me for the first time you're going to tell them the kingdom of heaven is near that's it it's your only message and hopefully everyone will know to recognize the king when the king is here they should be able to look at what we all agree or scriptures from the past that are from God that say this is what it's going to look like when the kingdom is in hand and the king is near but just in case they can't see those obvious supernatural signs I'm going to have you do some supernatural stuff too so it's really extra super double clear and you don't even need to take anything because they should recognize me as king and they should recognize you as my banner men just as it's reasonable to expect to go on a show where you have been booked and have the host know who they're interviewing so it is even more reasonable given the supernatural elements of all of this that Jesus would expect to be recognized by his own people as their king but what if they don't is Jesus gonna badge of them and make fun of them and make an uncomfortable interview I would really enjoy watching such an interview or is there some other way to push back on all of this well it's some other way and as we read along we got this positive language for the 12 to go do this stuff say this stuff you don't need to take money go into a town find somebody worthy when you're in our home give it your greeting if the home's deserving let your peace rest on it but if it's not let your peace return to you not exactly sure what that phrase means they're smart people than me who have theories and I've heard that it's some sort of notion of an ancient near eastern greeting I've also heard smart people suggest that this is the language of a banner men or a representative and ambassador of the king bearing a message or something and letting your peace rest on the house is letting the peace of the king rest on that household I really don't know and I don't want to fake it but he goes on to say if anyone won't welcome you listen to your words shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town I've actually done this a couple of times I'm not sure if I should be proud of it or ashamed of it but I'm telling you anyway I literally am taking off my shoes like Mr. Rogers right now I literally one time had a just a horrific experience with a given situation I got done it wrapped up quickly and I loaded up my stuff and I was leaving I was like you know why there's something in the Bible or whatever and I scrambled all around until I found this passage and I was like hmm I'm not sure if this actually applies or not but I took off my shoes which wreak good heavens and as I was done on my last day of doing this thing that I didn't like very much I literally dusted off my shoes and I had my wife take a picture of it was that entirely fair no is that an entirely good read on the passage and every time we leave a thing and we don't feel great about how it worked out that we should literally dust off our sandals no probably not and further I don't know my friends I have learned that when stuff gets weird and I'm pretty sure I'm right about everything in the moment then when I look back later and everything is a little less emotional I tend to have more ownership of the problems around me than I care to admit in the moment my point is not to say I had a bad thing happen I dust it off my sandals my point is to say there is some impulse within us to even if we're just imagining it say I'm going into a thing with goodwill I'm gonna do my best here and if that doesn't work out it's very liberating to have the option to say well fine cool all right whatever I guess we're just done here but here I think it was more than that here these people are going out with a direct commissioning from Jesus to do a thing with people who should recognize it and there's even language at the beginning of chapter 10 that indicates that it's different than you or me having our feelings hurt in a given situation and dusting off our sandals because here in verse one of chapter 10 it says he called his 12 disciples to him and gave them authority okay disciples that just means anybody who follows Jesus in this case we know it's talking about the inner circle the people who are really in but then in verse two we switch titles it says these are the names of the 12 apostles on apostle literally means one who is sent some people even argued about the legitimacy of the title apostle for Paul because he didn't physically meet Jesus during Jesus physical human lifetime it was a different kind of encounter with the resurrected Jesus according to the text on the way to Damascus apostle is a unique term as a subset of the term disciple and that distinction would have been more clear to an original Greek speaking audience but what they would have known is that I'm not a good person but what they would have known is that these people are ambassadors they are literally sent out by Jesus with literally a commissioning and a message they are banner men of the king and if someone rejects the banner men of the king who is directly commissioned to go and do kingdom stuff they are rejecting the king himself and therefore to dust off those sandals is more than just a catharsis to be like ha ha I'm done with you you big jerks it is the peace of the king no longer in any of the kingdom no longer in any way resting on that household they are rejecting that household with the authority of the king and you want me to go in that that's pretty harsh I don't know I've been around some church stuff and religious stuff sometimes people get weird about how they quit church or sign up for church or how mad they get when things fall out there that can change the entire trajectory of a life when you have a falling out with religious friends or church friends or a church in general and that's the shake the dust off the feet thing that sounds a little bit mean and I'm not gonna lie that is a little bit intimidating for me as well because I've just heard a bazillion horror stories of quitting church and signing up for church getting real weird and going sideways and people getting hurt and it's hard to untangle or sort out what the deal is there but we shouldn't compare this situation to that at all even though I totally just did it a minute ago whatever you know what I mean and the reason for that is here again we have a direct commissioning from the king and if he is all the things that he says he is it's completely under his purview to be like yeah you're out okay fine I guess the kingdom's not for you alright fine whatever it's cool that's petty and incomplete and assuming the authority and judgment of God if you were me or some TV evangelist person does it but in this case they were actually sent out to do this in this unique moment but as if that social discomfort and that really interesting image of shaking the dust off your feet isn't uncomfortable enough then Jesus ramps it up even further just to make sure everybody knows he's king and he has authority to judge does that make me uncomfortable yes but if anybody's gonna be doing the judging the almighty all knowing being who created everything and knows everything about justice and rightness and the motives of the human heart is the only one I'd even be remotely comfortable with having do it but he goes on to say in verse 15 I tell you the truth it'll be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town wow right to the Sodom and Gomorrah thing and like you and I hear this now and even people who have nothing to do with church and aren't into the Bible I'm a red in the of it pretty much everybody's heard about the whole Sodom and Gomorrah thing I mean for crying out loud we named Sodomy after it so you know it's out there and it conjures a lot of images and it conjures a lot of feelings and it conjures a lot of political loadedness it conjures probably for many a lot of inner turmoil and that is not how the original audience would have heard these words the connotations of Sodom and Gomorrah I think would have been different to the original audience and because of the sensitivity of the topic and also because of the severity of the warning and language Jesus is using I think it merits an entire conversation tomorrow about what on earth he means why is Jesus invoking this Old Testament story how would the original audience have understood it and what do we do with it now so we're gonna hit pause there and we're gonna get to more scary Jesus intimidating angry eyebrow Jesus next time around in the meantime I remind you that you and I my friend are fellow sojourners on this thing I don't own the Bible I'm not in charge of judgment for you or anybody I don't even know most of you though I'm sure you're lovely people and I would enjoy knowing you I'm not reading texts like this and in the back of my mind like haha that's what these people need to hear because only I know how the things are and I hope this gets through to somebody who's dumb and getting all the things wrong hopefully I'm coming at it just like you hopefully you're coming at it like I am Goodwill and trying to understand what the document says and if that leaves some kind of thing where you got to think about where you fit with it or what you do cool that's great but when we get to these points where Jesus is using very much is using very direct very appropriately judgmental language if he is the king I understand that can conjure a lot for all of us I can flash us back to some of our weirder moments with church and religion and ideas and authority in general and just know that I view us as peers in this conversation and do not for a second imagine that because I'm the guy who spent a couple hundred bucks on a microphone and I'm reading the text from the Bible that I'm the one who's in charge so thank you for hearing me out on that little disclaimer as we get ready to tear into frankly some pretty difficult text tomorrow alright I appreciate you I'm Matt this is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do it again soon
