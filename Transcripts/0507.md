 Hey friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and yesterday we started looking at this repeated motif throughout the book of Matthew Where you get this description of how the crowds felt about Jesus actions or teaching and as we're seeing in each of these moments Matthew isn't giving us an account of all the emotions everybody felt But just a pretty simple cut and dried summary of hey There was a moment that happened here and people were impressed Usually he cites the authority of Jesus in contrast to the raging Pundit class of the day as being the thing that prompts that sense of awe in the crowds But that sense of awe is one of the undercurrents the crowds are really an unnamed Sort of faceless character that runs parallel along the rest of the story And the whole time you're watching everything happen with Jesus. You're like oh wow dang that is really really interesting and cool But then you also glance down at the line that is representative of the faceless crowds and you notice they seem compelled They're having a lot of moments here, but I can't really tell if they're signing up or where this thing is headed So we're gonna look at more of that stuff today Jeff's gonna play some music and we're gonna get after it. Here we go Apparently a surefire way to have a moment that would break through in a big crowd was to deal with a demon possession Because in Matthew 12 22 says then they brought him a demon possessed man him being Jesus Who was blind and mute and Jesus healed him so that he could both talk and see all the people were astonished and said could this be the son of David? Now as you were a call the irony here is this miracle is happening in front of everybody and they're like Could this be the son of David? Whereas just like two chapters earlier at the end of nine You got the two blind guys who theoretically can't see anything and shouldn't know anything and they are calling Jesus the son of David and asking for mercy from him before he's even done anything or before they've even physically ever laid eyes on his Miraculous work in any way, but the crowds as we've observed you got to be patient with them. They're they're squishy or they're going through a process They're like you and me and it's a big claim it takes a minute to figure out what's going on Well, then we fast forward to Matthew chapter 22 and you might think oh I'm going right back to the verse that we looked at to start off But I'm not because the crowds being amazed is something Matthew tells us about twice in back-to-back anecdotes You remember the part where the Pharisee younglings and the Herodians come to Jesus and they ask him the questions about Pan-taxes the Caesar and all that business and Jesus says give the Caesar what Caesar's into God with gods And then it says when they heard this they were amazed so they left him and went away This is a little bit different moment because it doesn't say the crowds were amazed though if they overheard it I would assume that they were but the enemies were amazed They were blown away by what they just heard and they couldn't come up with any retort It's didn't we don't really we're just I mean how often does that happen to you? They weren't a fight. There's always some last word that comes to mind, right? They just left and then we go to the anecdote We've been talking about for the last few days and it ends the same thing when the crowds heard this verse 33 of Matthew chapter 22 They were astonished at his teaching. So it's very symmetrical with his first public teaching Where the crowds were amazed because he had authority didn't sound like exactly these people the Pharisees Sadducees, Herodians, the teachers of the law in general He sounded other not like the shrieking pundit class of their day He sounded like someone who could come along and as we discussed a couple days ago Talk about how marriage and the resurrection and eternal life all work apart even from the Bible and do so Authoritatively is if like yeah, I've been there before I totally know how this thing actually is and this is exactly how this thing actually is And then couple that with scripture and be like and here's exactly what the Bible says And it's weird that you guys miss that because it's right in front of you And it's like maybe even your theme verse bottom line is Jesus does not Bible like his contemporaries He doesn't debate like his contemporaries. He doesn't comport himself like his contemporaries His ideas and loyalty is not for hire like his contemporaries He is not tribal like his contemporaries by the way to that last point not for hire and clearly the Pharisees Sadducees Herodians everybody from a position of authority has taken a run at him They first and foremost they're like join me and we'll rule the universe together Like they're trying to get him to their side They're trying to get him to be in a position where he can be weaponizable to advance their cause But if we can't have him let's destroy him that seems to be the approach and my assessment of that I think it's gonna be indicated here in the next couple of pages when he gets Poked with nails and stuck to a tree and run through with the spear and stuff. Here's what I'm driving at though Matthew is obviously making an intentional choice to give us these quick hitter little descriptors of How the people were responding to this thing? He doesn't think that there's a lot of currency to be gained by going emotional and describing how intensely they felt it rather He's like yeah, take it or leave it the people were responding and they were responding in ways They never have to anything else in their entire lives He demonstrates this both by pointing out the actions that the crowds took and how they followed him Everybody in the original audience could have done the map on the financial Expenditure the risk that was being assumed for all of these different people to travel all around and entourage up with Jesus and try to ring every last drop of teaching and truth out of him that they possibly could but he's also Demonstrating the effect that Jesus is having on the crowds by talking about in general. This was the vibe This was their response, but There's one more undercurrent of meaning here that I think we need to acknowledge before we move forward and that is at the crowd for the most part He's still where they were at the end of the sermon on the Mount and at the sermon on the Mount Dang that sounds different than what we're used to I don't know what to do with that exactly but that is different for sure Matthew chapter 22 after a gajillion miracles walking on the water feeding 5,000 feeding 4,000 bringing dead people back to life The deaf can hear the blind can see the lame can walk more amazing teaching all kinds of growth confrontations with the intellectual religious elites and Jesus can handle them all now he makes his way into Jerusalem and now The big city is even celebrating him and he's demonstrated authority over the temple system Then nobody from the religious elites from the headquarters of religious elitism can even touch him It's not just that he can do it out in the sticks. He can do it on the big stage and The crowds are still roughly in the same place where they were before I don't totally know why that's good But that's good I'm not sure I totally want to jump in with this but It's still pretty interesting and I'm watching and despite the crowds recognizing authority when they saw it recognizing excellence when they see it recognizing something that maybe is even from God When they see it there is still a lot of real estate between dang that is impressive and Praying the prayer of fealty that Jesus described all the way back in the sermon on the Mount that Prayer that is effectively Abending the knee to a greater truer Reeler king and to pray that prayer to take that oath is to assume a right posture before the king but it is a posture of servitude of death to self and that was freaky for the squishy middle back then and it's freaky for you and me Those of us who I hope are thinking about this honestly regardless of where we are with it It's freaky. It's intimidating and so it's easy for us to be like oh the stupid crowds They just they didn't come along like Jesus was doing plenty to make it really clear But they didn't get it but we look back on it and we get it. Well, do I? I mean I bought a microphone and I got a little room down here in the basement and everything but do I really? like What would it actually look like if you really at the deepest level of your heart meant every single word of that prayer Every single day with every fiber of your being and every bit of action you took was run through the decision-making matrix of that prayer All I'm saying is I think it would look different than what I do and how I live and how I think even though I really care about this stuff and I'm trying my point is not to say we're all bad Nobody's Christian enough when we should all try harder I you do whatever you need to do this is the internet and figure that out for yourself My point is to say even though I want to point out in the text that the crowd seems to be squishy early on and seems to stay pretty squishy toward the end I Want to say that from a position of empathy is somebody else who probably would have responded about the same way They did if I were in their shoes in that moment in history. It is a hard question Grace and peace to them for seeing something amazing but not totally knowing what to do with it and really wrestling and struggling with the action part of that and Grace and peace to you and to me as we walk the same path They walked back in the day as the squishy middle crowd We're gonna come back to this theme of the crowds and their amazement and their fickleness and also Jesus teaching on the Narrow way. I think all of that is gonna come together in a really neat literary package as we get down the home stretch here I think these conversations are important for us really getting Matthew nailed down in the interest of as I said Just a minute ago us all having the opportunity to sort it through on its own merits for what it actually is Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon
