 Have a episode, an advent episode. Have a ten minute Bible hour podcast. It's an advent episode, an advent episode. Of a ten minute Bible hour podcast. Hey friends, it's Matt, this is the Ten Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and for the second straight week we're going to do a little Advent bonus episode here on Saturday. And for the second straight week I have turned on my crackling fireplaces, it doesn't really crackle very much because it's a gas fireplace, but it still makes me feel warm. It sets the mood properly for Christmassy conversations about Bible Christmas stuff last time around. We were looking at the Old Testament because the entire Old Testament points to Jesus. Jesus is the punchline of the Old Testament. It makes it sound like he's a joke, but I think you know what I mean. All of it anticipates the need for who Jesus would be, what Jesus would do, all of the sacrificial system, all of the ceremonial law, all of the civil law points to a need for completion. All of the narrative has all of these open-ended loose-end arcs that are just floating out there waiting to be collected and rounded out. The whole thing feels like you just got to the mid-season finale of a really well-written show, or even a cliffhanger ending of a great season of a great show. It's like, well, everything's set up beautifully. It's just begging for this other thing. And so when we go and we look at passages like we looked at last week in Isaiah, or if we go and we look at Micah or other places where there's overt references to the Messiah, all over the Psalms, for example, we see stuff that indicates that people got it and that they understood that the redemptive plan of God was not going to be completed in a government. It was not going to be completed in some political machinations, or ultimately perfect, flawless, cultural, exemplary, good, moral behavior. There was something bigger that had to happen, something that was outside the boundaries of what anybody pictures when they sit around and do pundit work to think about where society said it and who needs to do what and what are the scandals and the problems and crises bigger than all of the things we would ever think of. That's what was needed in order to solve what's broken about, not just this government or that government or the things that make us feel bad, but like Earth, like humanity, like the stuff that makes us us. Preservation and expansion of all of the transcendent, beautiful things, little doses, those little hints of the awesome stuff that we get from time to time in life. The world was begging for that. The prophets were begging for that, but also justice and a resolution and an addressing of all of the things that are broken and hurt and damage and that feel like that's not how things are supposed to be. There needs to be some kind of answer for that. All the prophets, all of the Old Testament, it's all pointing toward some sort of resolution that is way beyond the boundaries of what you would figure, way beyond the strategies people cook up. This was going to be something more. But then after we look at passages like what we looked at last week that are anticipatory from the Old Testament, we get this gigantic chunk of time, like longer than the United States has been a thing of what seems like nothing. Silence, no prophets, no more like, hey, remember though, the homicide thing, it's coming. So understandably, people get a little impatient, maybe a lot impatient, generational impatience sets in and people kind of forget or lose heart or start to second guess how they had been reading the prophets and how they had been reading and interpreting all of history and God's work in it. Maybe they start to recast, reimagine a little bit what God's next step would be or what the fulfillment to those promises would be. They dial back their expectations a little bit because the long wait has culturally generationally broken people's hearts or spirits a little bit. And then gradually in the process of those changing expectations, the source of hope that people look to understandably, I think, starts to change a little bit. And I'm like, ah, what if we go with something a little more tested than just waiting around on a deity we haven't heard from in a while, something more reliable historically. Like say, a gigantic army or a revolution or killing the people who are causing the problems or just trying to do a better government this time around. And so all of those ideas get tried in between the Old Testament, the stuff we were looking at last week and the first week of our Advent anticipation time we're spending together and the New Testament, where we picked it up two years ago as we got started in the book of Matthew. I know I've said it like a credulian times over the course of our conversations, but it's all over every page and we have to remember it. The mindset of the people when Jesus comes on the scene early in the first century AD is one that's pretty busted up, broken hearted. There's division. Nobody knows what to do. A lot of people feel like right now it's like the craziest things have ever been. We're coming apart. It seems culturally and I don't know. Maybe like, yeah, sometimes it's pretty unpleasant and sometimes we can get after each other pretty ugly, but I'm not sure that where we're at right now in terms of volatility is worse than the early first century in Judea when Jesus appears publicly on the scene. So by that point, some people have started to anticipate a different messiah, a different solution. Some people are still holding out hope and looking closely at who got his and what he's done in the past and they see the pattern. They're like, I don't think he's done. And they're anticipating something that looks very much like what Jesus would be. And I think a whole bunch of other people kind of quit anticipating altogether. There was a practical atheism, at least an atheism toward God's ongoing work through the promised redeemer, through the promised redemptive channels that had been in place and that had been handed down to them by their ancestors. And so with that in mind, nobody really knows exactly what to look for in terms of what the clues are going to be or how this whole thing would spin up and get started. So it had to been pretty insane for people who kind of had one eye out for the messiah when they look back on it and realize that what we're about to read in Luke chapter one and verse 26 until I decide that we're going to be done is what it looked like for the whole messiah thing to finally spin up in a tangible, physical way. Because as we're going to see, the whole thing starts in a backwater town with probably what we would have to call a teenage girl in a conversation that didn't happen in front of everybody and looks completely innocuous and wouldn't have pinged on any important person's radar in any way. This is how it goes. Luke 1 26. In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, the town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph. He's a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, greetings, you who are highly favored. The Lord is with you. Mary was greatly troubled. It is words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. But the angel said to her, don't be afraid, Mary, you've found favor with God. You'll be with child and give birth to a son and you're to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the son of the most high. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David and he'll reign over the house of Jacob forever. This kingdom will never end. How will this be? Mary asked the angel, since I'm a virgin. The angel answered, the Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you. So the Holy one to be born will be called the son of God. Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age and she who is said to be barren is in her sixth month, for nothing is impossible with God. I'm the Lord's servant, Mary answered. May it be to me as you have said, then the angel left her. Now for you and me who as we record this here are in the 23rd chapter of Matthew, that son of David line sure does pop now, doesn't it? That theme has been all over Matthew's account of this thing. In fact, the pivotal debate or discussion point that we just looked at at the end of chapter 22 is the one that's referenced to Psalm 110 where Jesus empathetically goes back to the Pharisees whose heads are kind of spinning from losing all of these public debates with him and he's like, hey, the Christ, whose son is he? And they're like, oh, the son of David. And he points out that the Messiah that Christ is going to be more than just the son of David. Yeah, that's one facet. There's this promise that God made regarding this eternal throne upon which a descendant of David was going to sit. And then his time goes along in the Old Testament, including stuff we looked at last time around. It becomes really evident that this is going to be more than just a political kingship. This is going to be like the kingship. But kingship is supposed to be what kingdom is supposed to be. It's going to be the rightening of all of the values and all of the currencies and everything is going to get straightened out big and little. And it's going to happen under this eternal reign. And because it's eternal, that's why you can ascribe all power and all glory and all authority and all everything to this promised king because he's not going to die and you're not going to have to worry about who's going to sit in that throne next and how they might abuse such powers that would be heaped on their hypothetical predecessor. Now, this is the king to solve all weaknesses that come with monarchy. This is the king of kings. This is the prince of peace. This is the one who can get all the stuff right and who by God's power will get all this stuff right. I bet Mary had heard this stuff. She'd been around it. I think everybody in Judea and Galilee had heard these stories. They probably debated it a little bit, kicked around what it would look like when it finally happened. It's actually happening and it's happening to her. Understandably, she's pretty troubled because I mean, and angel shows up like we hear a little crackle of sticks out in the woods. I do this other podcast and we've talked about a little bit. It's called Ironwood Rhino and you hear these stories. It's like, I heard a thing one time and that's enough for us to be really troubled and remember it years later and want to talk about it on a podcast. She has a supernatural being that shows up erasing any doubt about the unseen nature of the world beyond the physical and she's got to process all of that in one instant in one moment. Oh, and then this celestial being is also like, hey, I let you know you're a virgin and everything, but also you're you're totally going to get pregnant. But it's okay because it's going to be from God. Look, I don't care who you are. I don't care how religious or how good you are. That's going to be really troubling and it's going to raise some questions and she asks her questions and the angels like this is how it's going to work and this is awesome and it's blessing. It's going to be great. The most high is saying that you are super blessed among all women. And then in what is relayed to us as a very brief conversation, she comes to peace not only with this new epistemological reality she's faced with a means celestial being is right in front of her breaking the laws of time and space. That's kind of a lot to process. But also the role she is going to play in this larger narrative. She comes to grips with it very quickly. And even though she might not get everything, her response is to bend the knee. Her right response before the king has demonstrated in all of Luke and all of Matthew really in all of the Bible. She bends the knee and is like, all right, I'm in. This is my role in the plan. Then this is my role in the plan and things get off and running. Again, what she models is what the Bible holds out as the right response to the king. The idea is that once a character or even you or me figure out even a little bit of what we're dealing with with God, if we do the math on it properly, the only sensible response is to say, well, I can't be that. I can't do that. I can't make values or a kingdom like what you're talking about. Okay. I bend the knee. You get to be king. I get to be a subject. What's my role? And what Mary does is held out as the absolute ideal of right response to God, even in the face of not having all the explanations and all the answers to every single thing ever. And the result is that she's the mother of Jesus of Nazareth, the most influential person in the history of ever. And we'll look a little bit more at her response to this reality next time around. Thanks for adventing with me. Don't know if that's a verb, but I just made it one quick note for you in the spirit of all of that. My wife and I are working on Christmas cards for all the patrons who we have up to date addresses for. So if you want one of those, I would really love to send you one to say thanks. And even those of you who have just jumped in new, I mean, you're on the list. That's awesome. Hopefully we'll get that done here in the next couple of days. You have it before Christmas. We got a little picture taken and everything. And so yeah, if you could update addresses on Patreon, that would be a huge help for me. If you don't want a Christmas card, you don't have to put your address on there at all. That's no big deal either. But whether you are somebody sports program or someone who doesn't, either way, golly, I like you. And thank you for doing this with me and Merry Christmas as we anticipate the celebration of the arrival of Christ God in the flesh. And also as each of us thinks anew this year about what it all means for us and where we fit into the whole thing. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
