 As this ever happened to you, you have some really important cool thing happen in some little niche thing that you follow or maybe you run into some really important famous person who you think is really cool and then you go to somebody you care about and you're like, you won't believe what just happened. This thing just happened. I played this game and I won at the last minute like this. I was in a hotel and I stepped into the elevator and I met this important person and then the other person's like, I don't, I, I'm glad you're happy. I don't understand any of the things you're saying. I don't know who that is. I don't know why any of that matters. I'm going to play fantasy football, but I'm super glad that a neat thing happened for you and you're like, well, okay, it matters because never mind. If you've ever experienced that before, then you understand the reality that not everything has currency everywhere. Not everything has purchasing power everywhere. Not everything means everything to everybody, but it is really jarring when you run into somebody after being in the bubble for a long time who's not being a jerk. They just got a bigger perspective and outside perspective and they're just not naturally inclined to value the currencies that your social circle trades in at the same level that you value those currencies. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 22, that is exactly the kind of stunning upside down weird confusing scenario that we're running into as the Herodians and the underlings from the Pharisee party come to Jesus and try and trap him with this question about paying taxes to Caesar. And yes, we are going to talk about the actual issue of taxes at some point, but as you've probably been catching on to over the last few conversations we've had, I don't think this passage is mostly about taxes. I think this passage is a payoff on the question of authority and on the question of provision. I think this is a passage that is a payoff that is a repetition of a theme we've seen not just throughout all of Matthew, but throughout the whole Bible of God having the ability to actually provide and the currency of God being actual lasting backed up reliable currency and all human authority and human currency being very secondary, very in the moment, very like, well, I guess if that's the world you live in and that's what you're into right now, sure, I suppose I could see it. And so when the Pharisees and the Herodians come to Jesus and try and lay a trap for him with this question of taxes, Jesus response is jarring to them, to the original audience and to us because we realize like, oh my goodness, he just hand waved that whole thing. This is not to him, the chief question. What he is in toning with his answer is you're entirely missing the point by even asking this question the way you're asking it. So they come, they want to trap him and they ask him the question, Matthew 22 17, tell us then, what's your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? But Jesus, knowing their evil intent said, you hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me? Show me the coin used for paying the tax and they brought him into an area and he asked them, all right, whose portrait is on this and whose inscription? Caesars, they said, then he said to him, give to Caesar's, what is Caesar's and to God, what is God's? And when they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. It is nearly impossible for you or me to imagine a currency that has more currency than currency. A currency is the currency of everything. Nothing is the thing. But as we talked about over the last couple of episodes, it's kind of also an illusion. And especially in this Roman context, this illusion of value is kind of a weird mixture of actual mineral rarity and human energy expended to capture this mineral rarity, that being silver and all of that is kind of mixed with some vague central planned government assigned to the notion of what a day's wage is worth. And all of that is kind of mingled with this weird religious branding, religious narrative that declares that somehow this currency is blessed by the gods, bequeathed by the gods, birthed by the gods in the temple of the goddess of money on the hill of power in the center of Rome, which is in the metaphorical center of the empire. And there were a bunch of people who would have witnessed this exchange who would have been like, no, I'm 100% in on that narrative currency from Rome is the true currency. That is the truest, realist thing. Money. You can count on it. There would have been other people who would have looked at that and been like, yeah, but why do we have money changers here? I mean, we do that because we don't really buy that religious narrative from Rome. So we trade in this older coinage, the drachma, the tetra, drachma, the Tyrion shekel that we talked about back when we were looking at the incident where Peter goes and catches the fish and he's got the coins in the mouth and you pay the temple tax. You don't pay the temple tax in Roman coinage. You pay that temple tax and something else. So in a sense, Jesus is also cleverly driving a wedge between these two groups, the Pharisees and the Herodians who probably would have seen this coinage issue a little bit differently. So I suppose it's worth acknowledging the political cleverness of what he does here to subtly demonstrate that you guys are being totally disingenuous, creating this unnatural alliance that you've made to come and get me. The people who want to test Jesus think this question about currency is brass tax, but to someone with the grand perspective of God in the flesh, someone with the power perspective of I can create value out of thin air. I don't have to mine for minerals. I don't have to create some false narrative. I can make stuff out of not stuff. It just isn't the real brass tax anymore than me going up to some random person on the street and being like, I defeated my opponent in fantasy football last week. You need to acknowledge what a grand achievement that is. And that should have currency in your life. I know one cares about your fantasy football team and I never ever care about your fantasy football team because my stupid fantasy football team and my stupid fantasy football league are reflective of my tiny, tiny, tiny little world in the currency doesn't expand beyond the boundaries. No, the reality is that all the way back to the Old Testament, you've got this concept of God will ultimately provide. Now, that sounds like a trite cliche that people who are poor might say to themselves to feel a little bit better about being down on their luck. And I don't think it is a trite cliche. I have lived in very difficult circumstances at many points in my life. I did not grow up in a family of means. Things were very tight oftentimes. And in my little family saying that in our little corner of the world, what we were doing is repeating a name of God that is first manifest, I think explicitly in Genesis 22. And the story of Abraham and Isaac and the sacrifice that doesn't end up happening, but instead happens with this ram that's caught in a bush and God provides it. And I think the King James version renders it Jehovah Jireh that God will provide. That becomes a name attached to that location and to the God who provided not just for physical needs but for spiritual needs to metaphor for both. That's something we could break down more deeply some other time. And then you fast forward up to the book of Matthew and Jesus is pounding this Jehovah Jireh. God is the true provider concept again and again. In Matthew six, you got the Lord's prayer. Part of the Lord's prayer is bending the knee to the God who provides. Give us this day our daily bread. The right posture before God is to acknowledge that he is the ultimate provider. Right after that, you get the stuff about don't worry. God knows what you need before you even ask. He is the provider in his kingdom. Actual provision occurs. You get that stuff at the end of Matthew chapter 11 that goes, come to me all you who are weary and burdened. You rest to take my yoke upon you and learn from me from gentle and humble and heart. And you'll find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light. He's describing a different game, a different set of currency, a different world in chapters 14 and 15. You get the feeding of two massive groups of people. Where does that provision come from to feed them? Like, I don't know, a lunch box worth of stuff, but unlike the state, unlike your business, unlike anything else. God can call existence out of non-existence. So provision is something he has the capacity to do. And Matthew chapter eight, Lord, if you're willing, you can do this. Well, I am willing, I will provide. He's also willing to make this provision. That's who the text holds God out as being. Rome's currency was somewhat honest at times. At other times, it was a complete sham and it entirely depended on what the moment called for because there's an imbalance of power between the Roman people and the Roman state. So if they need to round up 675 million denary and then a couple of emperors later melt down all of it, remint it. So it looks shiny and good again, but do so at 5% less purity and just pocket all of that profit and give everybody back the coins and tell them that it has the exact same value because it was birthed by the gods in a temple on a hill. People for the most part are going to take that and be like, great. Even though they're completely being scammed through dishonesty. God, who has an unlimited amount of resources according to the way he's held out in the text here, doesn't have any such limitations. He doesn't need to scam you out of value. He doesn't need to lie to you with a fake story. He doesn't need to recollect your coinage and melt it down. He doesn't need to debase currency so that he can barely keep things together and so that the cracks won't show because if people ever quit believing in the power of Rome, it's all over. God is God. He's immutable and unchangeable, regardless of opinion, regardless of where people are at. God genuinely provides because God genuinely owns. God genuinely provides because he genuinely has the unending resources to provide. God genuinely provides because God genuinely cares about his creation. There's a massive contrast here between the little bubble of all of the different world kingdoms that come and go very quickly, relatively speaking over the course of history and this unending kingdom with this unending king and the massive power and resources associated with him. But when we get to Matthew chapter 22 and we get to this passage, it is tempting to just rush right to the end and be like, well, what percentage of taxes should we pay in this country? How should we vote in the next election? As just the wrong question, there's a much bigger payoff happening here in the grand context of the Bible and politics that this passage first and foremost is about God is the one who is the provider. God is the one who makes value and as we're going to get to over the next couple of days, he put his animated image on people. He put his soul image on people that is so much more profound than Caesar putting his metal static image on a coin. Yet people are all fretting about who gets the coin that Caesar put his face on. And Jesus is going to in tone here that you should be fretting much more about who gets you who God put so much more of his image upon relatively speaking. Thanks for gaming this out with me. We'll actually get to the tax part tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
