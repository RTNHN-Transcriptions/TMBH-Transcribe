 Bible controversy, Bible controversy. We've got a Bible controversy. The big one, it's Matthew chapter 21. It's a crisis. It's a massive problem. And we're gonna have to try to solve it today or else everything in the world and everything about God is gonna completely fall apart. So hang on to your butts. The other day I sent my little boy out to the car, which was packed with a bunch of stuff from a trip we'd been on. I was like, hey, there's a thing that I need and it is either in the black backpack or it is in my camera backpack. So find that and bring it to me. And the little boy, who was always incredibly helpful, went out and was like, I don't know about that thing, but he said it was in one of these two backpacks. So he just brought me back the two backpacks. And sure enough, the thing I needed was in them. Now here's a question for you. What did I mean by them? Was the thing that I needed in both backpacks or was the thing that I needed in one backpack? Because you could both rightly say that the thing that I needed, which was a charger, let's just call it a charger, that the charger I needed was in the backpack, but it was also in the backpacks because the backpacks are a group and one of the backpacks contained the thing. So it works either way. And if you understand English, there would be no controversy. If my son later on was like, yeah, he needed me to get the charger and I didn't know where it was. So I brought the backpacks and it was in them. It wouldn't be complex. You'd just be like, oh, I was in one of the backpacks. I worked south, that was great. But when you add a couple thousand years to the equation and when you add some massive theological life implications takes to the equation and when you add some translation across language and culture, you can run into the occasional Bible crisis over little words and details and turns of phrases like the one I just put in front of you. And today we are going to take a bit of an aside from this otherwise beautiful happy fun passage to address this controversy that is hidden within it. Yesterday we talked about Zechariah 9.9 and apparently that overlaps with Isaiah 62 as you might remember from yesterday. That surprised me a little bit, but I see it there. But mostly I think of this passage as being connected with Zechariah 9.9, specifically the part here that is quoted in response to some events that unfold. So Jesus tells the disciples, go to the village ahead of you and once you'll find a donkey tied there with her cult by her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord needs them and he'll send them right away. This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, say to the daughter of Zion, see your king comes to you gentle and writing on a donkey on a cult, the full of a donkey. So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. They brought the donkey and the cult placed their cloaks on them and Jesus sat on them. It seems like it wouldn't be that controversial. It sounds like there's a donkey and a cult and then Jesus sent his disciples and sure enough, he was right. He had seen them in his mind's eye or whatever. And the person who owned them was like, okay, well, if the Lord needs them, go for it. And so they just took them, they brought them to Jesus and they threw a bunch of cloaks over them, maybe over both of the animals, maybe over one. But what is abundantly clear is that Jesus sat on a makeshift comfort saddle made of all of the disciples' cloaks and rode on one of those beasts into the city and then people greeted him enthusiastically. But there's some folks who compare this with the other synoptic gospels. The synoptic gospels are Matthew, Mark and Luke synoptic, sin, same, optic eye. John has a very different tone and style, even though the details still line up really neatly. So the other synoptics have this reading a little bit more specifically. There's no linguistic ambiguity as to how many animals there were. They just have Jesus riding on a donkey into the city. But here, it looks like Matthew is doing something. It looks like we're getting that two backpack linguistic scenario that I was describing with my kid, where the language is a bit more encompassing. There are definitely two animals in view and definitely two animals get brought to Jesus and definitely Jesus has two animals in view, untied them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them and he will send them right away. So Jesus has two animals in view. The disciples bring two animals. And the prophetic reference highlighted here in Matthew seems to have multiple animals in view. But just to get that nailed down, let's go back here and look at that again. Zechariah nine and nine. Okay, rejoice greatly. We're back in Zechariah now. Oh, daughter of Zion, shout daughter of Jerusalem. See your king comes to you, writes to the Sanamis salvation, gentle and writing on a donkey comma on a cult comma, the full of a donkey. And then he can send all the stuff about the peace language we looked at yesterday, take away the chariots, the war horses go away. So I don't know. How do you read the English translation of the Hebrew there in Zechariah? How many animals are we talking about? Gentle and writing on a donkey on a cult, the full of a donkey, is each of those things clarifying the original animal that is being referenced? Or is this person who is coming going to ride on two animals, a donkey and a cult, or three animals, a donkey and a cult and a full of a donkey, like all at once? The rest of the language around it looks pretty poetic and structurally without getting into every last detail in part because it would take a lot of time and in part because I'm not an expert on exactly how this stuff breaks down. Hebrew is not my strong suit. My understanding from people much, much smarter than me who do this for a living is that structurally this is not quite as cut and dried as the way some of this poetic prophetic structure sometimes reads. And so my understanding is that even amongst first century contemporary rabbis who studied the text at the time of Jesus and at the time Matthew was writing this stuff, there was an exact clarity on how to read this prophetic expectation. And there were different schools of thought as to exactly how this king that the daughter of Zion should rejoice about would show up. And so in keeping with that, it looks as though what Matthew is doing is he's making a nod to the larger conversation. It looks like he knows that this debate existed whereas Luke would not know that debate existed and Peter who informed Mark would not know that debate existed. But Matthew, who seems to be very, very steeped in Judaism, knew there was this incredibly picky, unish specific religious debate about exactly how to read Zechariah 9 and what this would look like when it happened. And so in light of that, it is not surprising to me that Matthew felt like he needed to demonstrate his awareness of this debate so that he wouldn't be immediately written off by the super smart, fancy academic types but that he demonstrates this awareness by including details as they unfolded that the others wouldn't feel any pressure or need to include. Well, the critique of this passage goes like this, that Matthew was unable to read Zechariah properly and because he was confused by some of the original language, he took an overly literal read on this and in his desperation to make Jesus the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophets, he shoehorned this in and was like, oh no, that's not gonna work. Jesus has to show up like writing maybe, could be one, could be two, could be three things. Let's just shoot the middle and put them on two things so we account for a doggy, the first one's a doggy and the third thing in the list is a doggy. The second thing was a cult. So one doggy covers the first mention of a doggy and the second mention of a doggy and one cult covers the one mention of a cult. Boom, problem solved, we're just gonna have Jesus straddle them both and ride in like somebody at a circus with two animals and he's like draped over them, I guess or maybe the cloaks were used to make a doggy bridge so he could lay on the doggy bridge and what better way really to communicate the humility of the king than to have him come bumping and clomping into town partially rolling off of these two animals in a way that would look ridiculous and clown-like to everyone and cause him to laugh at him hysterically because of how stupid this, well wait, but that's not what they did at all. The crowds got out their cloaks and spread them on the road and then they shouted spontaneously, Hosanna to the son of David, blessed is he who comes in the, I don't know, they didn't react like someone who was being a complete idiot and riding on animals in ways that don't make any sense and would look ridiculous and more like a joke than anything seriously. So I guess that's one pushback I have on the assertion that Matthew was trying to shoehorn a prophecy and to fitting here wasn't properly equipped to read Zechariah and thus got it wrong. Another pushback that I would have is all the other places where we see prophecy being referenced in Matthew and how absolutely precise and as I recall from my seminary days, culturally aware of what the debate looked like on all of these. Now, just like if you heard the story about my son going out to get the charger out of the backpack and so he brings in both backpacks just to be absolutely sure and then sure enough, the charger was in the backpacks or we could say sure enough, the charger was in the backpack. You understand that that kind of ambiguity will happen from time to time with language, but that common sense can cause you to easily interpret the situation. Look, most of us are not gonna be nuanced enough at Greek or Hebrew to carefully unpack this language, but common sense makes it work here. So the critique that verses six and seven should be read as the disciples went and did as Jesus instructed him, they brought the donkey and the cult placed their cloaks on them and Jesus sat on them and that that second them means sat on both animals at once and rode into town trick ride style. I think that's the more desperate interpretation. I think the infinitely more natural interpretation of this quote unquote controversial passage is to just apply the same logic we applied at the backpacks. I'm like, well, okay, what's the antecedent to end Jesus sat on them? Well, the most recent antecedent in the text is cloaks. They brought the donkey and the cult. Okay, there's a possible antecedent, placed their cloaks on them. There's a more recent antecedent and Jesus sat on them. Well, which is more likely that Jesus trick rode two animals at once to make some kind of point or that there were a lot of cloaks and he sat on all the cloaks? Look, if Jesus could trick ride the horses and donkeys and cults all at once and wow everybody with that, it doesn't really wreck the Bible for me or anything. But if you're doing your own homework on this and you're working through it, it's very possible that you will come across this, I think rather weak objection to the text and if people wanted to raise stronger objections to the text, I just think they're barking up the wrong tree here and there are other more ambiguous texts throughout the New Testament, including one we'll get to here in a little while, that maybe do pose a bit more of a difficulty in a challenge, but this one, I think is pretty straightforward. Thank you so much to everybody who's supporting the program. There are some things that we're doing that are not gonna be visible on the internet. The bottom line is there's a lot of follow up that comes from this podcast and from the YouTube channel that just needs attention and that's been very difficult for me to keep up with in the past and increasingly the fact that you exist, it not only makes this possible, but it also makes it possible for me to have some help in trying to respond to the things that are coming in from people as this audience grows, but in ways that would not be immediately evident to you, your support of TMBH is making it more and more possible for me to try and stay on top of all of that stuff. So yeah, beyond the normal, thank you. Thank you for supporting the podcast. It makes a big difference in ways that you see and in ways that you don't. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute BibleEye Hour Podcast. Let's do this again. Still Elliott.
