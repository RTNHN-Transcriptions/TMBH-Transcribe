 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Proverbs. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. Today we're talking about the book of Proverbs, and I think this one is straightforward with a couple of caveats. At the most basic level, this is a compendium. It's a collection of wise sayings that are not promises or guarantees about how everything's going to work out if you do this, then this will always happen. But the genre was understood by the original audience to be best practices, to be guidelines for wise and right living in relationship to God, in relationship to self, in relationship to others, and in relationship to this personified notion of wisdom herself. Solomon is the main character associated with this. So yesterday we looked at Psalms, which is a book that's written by a whole bunch of different people, but we talked about how there was that aggregator. There's a person who made the editorial choices and pulled all of these things together. Somebody was a collector, if you will, of all of the great songs and poems and prose from across the centuries of God's chosen people. Well, likewise here, it looks like Solomon had become a collector of great ideas, a collector of wisdom and truth. Solomon was a pretty international guy. He had relationships with people beyond his own borders. I think it's possible that even some of this wisdom is stuff that he was identifying as having the fingerprint of God, even if it was coming from some outside source. We don't get to know the sources of all of the Proverbs, but they're all held out as being good counsel for right living and for internalizing the values of God and living in a way that is rooted in a healthy respect, even fear of God. Indeed, explicitly one of the key principles here is the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. But if we imagine that the book of Proverbs is just one solid wall of little truisms from end to end, that would be incorrect. Proverbs has some dynamics to it. There's a narrative here, but there are different movements, different things going on, different organizational moments, if you will, throughout the book of Proverbs. And the first organizational moment is a collection of these wise statements that Solomon is imparting to his son. Now, you might be thinking, hmm, it wasn't that long ago that we were just talking about Solomon's reign and the Old Testament. And it seems like his sons didn't do particularly well and by not particularly well. I mean, committed horrible atrocities against their siblings and civil war to the country. It went pretty badly. If this was good advice, the Solomon gave his sons doesn't look like they took it to heart and you're absolutely right. They didn't. So if he gave this advice to them and we're being invited to listen in, so to speak, on that same advice and maybe take it to heart for ourselves, well, what gives? How can we trust all of this? But that brings us back to this larger point. I mean, even very specifically, we got a proverb a little bit further on in here that says, train up your children in the way they should go. And when they're old, they will not turn from it. Solomon's own sons who heard all of these proverbs apparently did turn from it. And I think this potential critique is actually a feature, not a bug identifying this right up front because we start with Solomon and this fatherly advice. And because all the readers of this in the original audience would have known how it went with Solomon and his family, it's not like Proverbs here is trying to pull one over on people and be like, well, hopefully they just forgot about all of that. And they're completely illiterate about the story of their own people. Now, this book continued to be popular and to circulate long after everybody knows how things played out for Solomon's family. Instead, I say again, the fact that we open with this is a feature, not a bug because it frames our mind the right way to remember we're not reading the Old Testament law here. We're not reading a prophet who's showing up to tell everybody like, this is what you're doing wrong. You got to turn from these things. We're reading best practices. We're reading simple, memorable distillations of the wisdom of God for rightly interacting with again, God, self, others, the notion of wisdom itself. And usually though there are grand exceptions to this, if you do these things, you got a good shot at stuff going right. And things are even probably more likely to work out in good ways for you in a practical sense. Look, in the case of Solomon and his kid, well, it didn't work out entirely practical. Sense. And these lessons weren't retained, but it doesn't mean it's not good advice. But sprinkle into this opening section of Proverbs is the first nine chapters. We keep running into this personification of wisdom, kind of like the Statue of Liberty is a personification of the idea of Liberty. But this lady wisdom character has some prose dedicated to her that is all about this idea that wisdom just is, that there is some kind of order to things, that there is a rightness and that lady wisdom, she's not changing. She's something who calls to you by merit of her mere existence for you to conform to the reality, the greater reality that is her. So as we get done with chapter nine of Proverbs, we're all squared up. We're clear from the Solomon father to son stuff that these are not laws, that these are not somehow prophetic guarantees that you can just take to the bank. If you do this, God owes you that. And that what we're talking about here is something that's somewhat philosophical in nature as well. We're talking about this orienting beacon of truth and wisdom to which people are called to again, orient themselves. The right reader of Proverbs then is going to receive everything that comes next in light of those assumptions. And indeed, what we get next is 19 straight chapters of just straight forward Proverbs. People who like to rib the Bible and offer some healthy critiques that they see here there will often go right to the Proverbs and they'll pick Proverbs from around the book and be like, look, these two seem to conflict. But again, the person is properly equipped to read Proverbs by orienting themselves using those first nine chapters is going to see those and be like, oh, yeah, but in a given circumstance, that first proverb example that you give that might seem to be in conflict with another, it actually makes sense. But in another context, you got to read the room. That second one is going to make sense. And you have to use judgment even in trying to figure out when to apply, which of these Proverbs to your situation. So there's just a ton of little one off best practice distillations of the wisdom of God throughout Proverbs. And you know what I'm going to do right now? I'm just going to read some of them without planning in any way, whatever we get, whatever we get, Proverbs 15 one. Oh, I know this one. A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. You're going to detect the repeated pattern here real quick. If you don't already know it, let's try Proverbs 19 12. Oh, it's got wrath again. A king's wrath is like the growling of a lion, but his favor like do on the grass. Interesting. Notice in that one, there's not really anything for you to do. It's more of a, hey, read the room and be aware of what's going on kind of Proverb. Know that this is how kings are. Let's try Proverbs 22 nine. Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed for he shares his bread with the poor. This one follows more of that beatitudes structure that we see in Matthew five in the sermon on the mount. Let's try another one. Proverbs 26 one like snow in summer or rain and harvest. So honor is not fitting for a fool. I like that one. It's got teeth. Proverbs 26 24, whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart. Proverbs 27 one do not boast about tomorrow for you don't know what a day may bring. Are you seeing how some of these are just situational awareness? Some of these are very practical. Hey, do this, but don't do that. Others seem to be exhorting someone to right living in a way that has a little bit more delicate touch. Others are offering observations about the state of humanity so that you can recognize patterns and make quick shrewd judgments about what you see going on around you. Look, red wrong even. This is really powerful, useful stuff, but red right that is framed and oriented by the first nine chapters. These proverbs become a treasure trove of wisdom regardless of who you are or when you're reading it or how old you are, what circumstances you're facing. And then in chapter 30, we get a little section that I had kind of forgotten about until I read through this again. There's proverbs or there's a statement from somebody named Agor. I don't know who this is, but right off the bat, he comes off like a really sympathetic character to the reader because he's somebody who's like, I would like to have more wisdom and I'd like to understand how to sort through things. And through his words in chapter 30, you get a sense of here's the right way to orient yourself through humility and attentiveness and fear of the Lord to reading the proverbs correctly. So it's kind of like a built in interpretation guide right there in chapter 30. And then the final chapter 31 comes from someone named King Lemuel. I don't know who he was king over, but this is where we get the famous remarks about another beautiful, elegant lady who is held out as a beacon of virtue and wisdom. And this is the woman of noble character. And on a personal note, I really appreciate reading through this chapter because I'm married to one of those. And that has been one of the greatest joys and blessings of my life. This is awesome. The only way it gets sideways and gets into being a little bit of a weird read is if you read it kind of like Job's friends and you're like, wait a dang minute, God, you said in this turn of a phrase that if I did X, you would give me why. And instead I did X and you gave me Z. What the heck? What gives? Well, if you want to sort that through, go read Job or Ecclesiastes that we're going to get to soon. It's not like the Bible doesn't speak to what happens when you run into an exception to these proverbs. It speaks to it in great depth. It wrestles it through with tremendous transparency and honesty. And if you remember the conversation from Job, the conclusion is ultimately you're going to have to trust in the wisdom and justice of God. But there's an acknowledgement that God sees that those outliers would be disorienting. That said, just because there are outliers to what we see in Proverbs should do nothing to diminish the best practice reality of these timeless distillations of the wisdom of God. When you visualize the book of Proverbs, picture that lady wisdom character from the first nine chapters, when you think about the theme of Proverbs, think about wisdom applied. And if you don't have time to read the whole book, go and check out Proverbs one seven and then pick any random 25 Proverbs from chapters 10 to 29 and just see what you get. Boom. And with that, we have leveled up on the book of Proverbs, you and I, and next time around, we're going to see if we can level up the book of Ecclesiastes. Thanks for doing this with me. I'm Matt.
