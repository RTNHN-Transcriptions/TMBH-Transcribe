 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Second Kings. ["The Second Kings"] Hey my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and we were looking at Second Kings this time around, which isn't even really the sequel to First Kings. It's just all kings. It's one thing. There is no sequel here. So when you read the end of First Kings, and then you turn the page over to the beginning of Second Kings, it just keeps rolling. You would never know if you would just put it all together with text because it is one book divided after the fact. Now like we talked about last time, this isn't just a history book, this is a history book with a very clear purpose, and that purpose, as it is being written from somewhere in the middle of the 500s BC, probably from Persia, is to address the remnant, the people who were taken away into captivity, the Israelite people, the Jewish people, and to hold a light up to all of the history of what went wrong, to remind whoever was reading this in the 500s BC of how we got here. Why are we Persian captives again? Why don't we just continue to live where our ancestors lived and worship where our ancestors worshiped? How did this go so badly off the rails when we get our answers in First and Second Kings? Which start very promisingly with David, he's old and he's getting close to dying, but he's saying things to his son Solomon and First Kings about, hey, you gotta be loyal to God and obey the commands like all the stuff that you would want. It looks like he would pass the evaluative test and Solomon's like, okay, all right. But then David at the end of that expression of bedside wishes is also like, hey, make sure to kill some people and engage in a lot of political intrigue toward these enemies. They can't be trusted. And that kind of sets the tone for where everything goes from there. This ends up through First and Second Kings not looking like a people set apart from God. They just look like everybody else. And maybe that's the biggest disappointment in all of it. They're fickle religiously like everybody else. They engage in bloodshed like everybody else. They have slaves like everybody else. They're not good at the peaceful transfer of power like everybody else. And just like everybody else in the end, they're groveling at the table of the big empires for whatever little political scraps they might be willing to throw them. So it's kind of sad, a little bit pathetic. Certainly you come away with the feeling this is a squandered potential kind of situation, even reading it all these years later. How much more so must the original audience reading this in Persia have felt that emotion. Ah, we blew it. Tell us again how exactly we got this wrong. And then I think we can intuit from there what it would look like to get it right next time, which would be just do the opposite of what all of the kings who failed the test did. So Second Kings picks up with the death of Ahab. And then we just start this list of king after king, after king, we get details specific to each one of them or almost all of them about exactly how they got things wrong. So often you add him credit, they're really very creative in terms of how they get it wrong. But Old Man, Elijah passes along his authority, his mantle, if you will, of profit to young man, Alisha. And the contrast between Alisha and the kings he communicates with is fantastic. The impotence and small thinking that's on display with all of these kings were supposed to be the most powerful, the sovereign of the land. It looks so pitiful, contrasted with the power that God has vested in Alisha and the stability of the passing on of authority from Elijah to Alisha, contrasted with the inability to hand off power cleanly from one ruler to the next in Israel, I think speaks volumes as well. And ultimately Israel spirals so far out of control making stupid international treaties and deals all in direct opposition to the prophets who God keeps sending them. It results in them running afoul of the worst people we've ever encountered in all of the history of the Bible up to this point. That's Assyria, they're monsters. They are a mean evil empire. And this is an important little historical side note here. When you think of the spectrum of evil Bible empires in the Old Testament, they're big, like the big massive ones, think of it this way. Assyria is all the way on the end of the spectrum toward awful. They're just monsters and I wanna get into it, but you can Google that stuff and find out for yourself exactly what the deal is. Babylon, put them in the middle, they're mixed bag. There's some enlightenment and nobility to Babylon, but there's also a real short fuse with Babylon and some ugly stuff there as well. And then put Persia on the far end of the good stuff. The Old Testament actually holds out Persia as being an instrument of God for good. Now Persia, as we go back and dig deeply into who they are and what they did, I mean, they got problems as well. It's not so neat and tidy ethically, but they are miles apart from Assyria in terms of their quality and their artistry and their morality and their dedication to law and how they treat defeated people, Persia's just the best. Now you're probably wondering like, well, where does Egypt go? Put Egypt somewhere else. Egypt is so ancient and weather's the storm for so long. We see so many different incarnations of what Egypt is over really the millennia that Egypt should be thought of more as, well, it depends on when you're asking in terms of what you're gonna get from them. But Assyria is awful and the hubris of the Northern Kingdom of Israel finally comes home to roost. God judges them by the power of Assyria and they get taken away into captivity. Sort of never to be heard from again. This is a massive problem for the person who is reading straight through the Old Testament and who's really latched on to the warning, I guess if you will, that God gave the serpent all the way back in the beginning of Genesis where it looks like the serpent just won and ruined everything. And now redemption's gonna be impossible, but God in lecturing that serpent is like, now there's gonna be one who comes and crushes your head. You're gonna strike at his heel, but he's gonna crush you. So if you're the kind of reader who's like, I like that part where the evil loses and there's some kind of redemption and this story that seems very chaotic and bad ends up somewhere good. I want that. And if you're the kind of person who latched onto the promises that God was making to Abraham in the middle of Genesis and the promise that God made to David about this eternal king and this eternal kingdom and this great king who's gonna reign forever, that's the good stuff. That's the through line of redemption. That's the business you're excited about. Well, pretty much all of the family of Abraham, just in like half a page, gets defeated and taken away into total historical obscurity, there is not much left through which this redemption can even come. The whole thing, the whole narrative, the whole hope for humanity and everything is hanging by a thread after chapter 17. And so then as you keep going through second kings, you're gonna be like, all right, well now all of our hopes are on that southern kingdom. That's all that's left. Come on, come through baby, but they don't. It becomes quickly apparent despite a couple of revivals led by mostly sensible kings like Hezekiah and Josiah. Who rediscovers the law. It's almost like too little, too late when he finds it and King Nebuchadnezzar from Babylon, Babylon. The great shows up in, I think we still say 586 BC. There's a little bit of debate about that precise year and he conquers Jerusalem. He leaves the temple destroyed. The dwelling place of God is destroyed. And we wrap up this book with Nebuchadnezzar hauling away what's left of Abraham's descendants, the people through whom the promises held, they get taken away to the east to Babylon. Where does the presence of God dwell now? What happens to the covenant that God made with Moses? Is it over? What about that great nation that was supposed to occur? What about this eternal king and eternal kingdom and all of the redemption that was supposed to happen there? It really genuinely does read at the end of second kings like all hope is lost, except for this one strange little bonus bit right at the end. Have you ever seen one of those things floating around the internet where they're like, who would be King of America today if we went off of George Washington's descendants? Yeah, I don't remember what the guy's name is, but they're like, this would be the guy who would be King of America. Oh, okay, well, whatever, sounds good. Well, apparently they kept track of that kind of stuff in captivity in Babylon as well. And there was this guy named Jehoiachine who was not King, but I guess he would have been King. And for whatever unusual reason, God, it looks like, prompts the King of Babylon to show him some kind of favor. And it's not like the King of Babylon, it's like, all right, you can go home and you can have a whole kingdom again and everything. No, no, no, no, nothing like that. Just let some eat at the table with the King of Babylon. And that's it. So why is that there? I don't think it's that tricky actually. It's a glimmer of hope that God is still intending to keep his promise to David, that the whole redemptive plan is still on and it's a bit of foreshadowing for what's gonna happen not under the rule of the Babylonians, but what's gonna happen under the rule of the next great empire, that being the Persians who are gonna conquer Babylon. And as we'll see as we work through the narrative of the Old Testament more, they are gonna be the ones politically who show great favor to God's chosen people. The little glimmer that we get with Jehoiachine is going to be realized much more in the coming historical books. If you're a fan of the redemptive plan, first and second kings look really, really bad, but we don't see anything that says that the plan is off. It looks like this is still a go. Now the deck is just totally stacked against God and we're left to wonder, how is he gonna pull this off? Well, there's one way to find out and that is forward. First Chronicles next time around.
