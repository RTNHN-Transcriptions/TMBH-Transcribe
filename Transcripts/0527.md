 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. I've been going to churches, a ton of them, like all the time. I'm fascinated by churches from a historical taxonomical point of view, like, how did this church turn out this way? How does it connect to the Christian family tree? I'm fascinated by the theology of churches. What does it look like for you to believe this and then have a worship service? How does that go? I'm interested in trying to empathetically understand why people who do it differently than me would do it differently than me. And I'm very intrigued by looking at how different churches think about people who are outsiders to their tradition. There are some churches that I've walked into cold, my friends, where I'm telling you, I think they must have had hours upon hours of meetings, maybe had people like even secret shop their church so that they could remember back to what it was like when they didn't go to church and when they'd never been there so they could think outside themselves and build so much of what they're doing with the outsider in mind. Not some churches, like that's all they do is try to make it make sense to the outsider. I'm not talking about like, I guess what we would call that kind of seeker style church that was popular 10, 20, 30 years ago. I'm talking about churches that are just doing their thing. Like this is what we believe is who we are, pretty excited about God, Bible, and participating, the community being redemptive, things like that. But we also understand that if somebody walks in this door, we want to quickly overcome the social trepidation and hurdles that they might be feeling and we want them to just be here and experience the thing for what it is and know that we're glad that they're there. And then so they're just all these little things like signage and people and the way things are laid out, the website, there's just tons of things that are meant to overcome those hurdles to make that very difficult thing, which is walking into a church for the first time, especially if you've never been to any church at all, is to make that thing easier. And I love going to those churches and seeing how outside of themselves they think. Guess what? There's a corollary coming in here. It is on the other side. I've been to a lot of churches where pretty much everything about what they do, man, the vibe just screams. If you're not already one of us, go to a different church and you can feel it from the minute you come in the parking lot, from the minute you walk right past to the person who's wearing a name tag that says a greeter and they don't do the thing that's on the name tag. You can go in and sit in the front row with Bibles and all the kids, their shirts tucked in. We're saying, hey, we're here to check out your church and be apart and not a thing. And I'm not going to lie, my friends. That chafes me. It pains me to even tell you that that has been my experience because I don't want Christianity to look stupid. I think there's life in this thing. I think Christianity is reflective of the kingdom. These beautiful values we've been talking about and the beautiful characteristics of its king. I'm very, very enthusiastic about Christianity and the kingdom and the Bible and all of that stuff. And I know there's a ton of you who listen to this, who are not in. You are outsiders to the thing. And I hope that someday you become Christians and that it proves to be wildly meaningful and awesome for you. And so I'm not saying this to be like, so don't go to church. They might not greet you. But you know what? They might not greet you because some churches are just awful at this. And I don't know what they think they're doing. I don't know what they think they exist for or what the plan is there. Try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it's an awful frustrating experience when I go and I run into churches that simply aren't thinking outside themselves at all. And it feels like they are slamming the door in the faces of people who need to hear the stuff and it is wildly different than those churches I go to where it feels like, now they've thought about the fact that they should try to connect with people who aren't already a part of the circle and expand their circle. And this list of woes that Jesus is reeling off here in Matthew chapter 23 in front of everybody near the temple on, I guess what Christians historically call passion week. It's Passover week. He's made his way to Jerusalem. It's showdown time. We're getting down to the final act, the final climax confrontation of the book of Matthew. And Jesus looks like he has every opportunity in this passage to just walk away and be like, well, we had some back and forths about Caesar and getting married and life after death and the greatest commandment and and whose son is the Messiah and that was nice. And now Jesus could just wander off into the countryside and be done. He hasn't totally burned any bridges. He hasn't said anything that necessarily needs to get him killed yet. But then he turns right around and it's like, nope, I'm going to press on this and we're going to say the things out loud that need to be set out loud. And he's going to lay out all of these series of woe to you statements, the first of which goes like this, Matthew 2313, woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites, you shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter nor will you let those enter who are trying to. This is the first of seven woes that Jesus is going to pronounce and the teachers of the law and the Pharisees for sure and probably a bunch of other people standing around would have had their brains go right to Jeremiah chapter 23 verse two, verse one, right from the beginning, which says, woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture declares the Lord. Therefore, this is what the Lord the God of Israel says to the shepherds who tend my people because you scattered my flock and have driven them away and have not bestowed care on them. I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done declares the Lord. If you're one of these people who listens to this podcast while you're not working out and you actually have a Bible with you, maybe like stick something in there, but not like food or anything. You don't want to gum up the pages. Jeremiah 23 is a very important part of the Bible. It's like, I got a pen here put the pen in. If you have a pen or maybe a guitar pick or a mouse, put that in there. It might feel like I'm over explaining right now, but this is very important and we're going to come back to it. Back to Matthew chapter 23 though. So this original audience of people standing there hearing this are going to be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you're likening us to the people who ruined everything and provoked the wrath of God in such a way that in 586 BC, Nebuchadnezzar, that deplorable outsider came in and plundered everything and wrecked the great and glorious temple of God. Jesus, you would dain to stand here in front of everybody in the shadow of this temple that we had to rebuild because of what Nebuchadnezzar and our flawed ancestors did. You're going to stand in the shadow of that temple and you are going to liken our noble behavior to that abysmal failure. How dare you? But yeah, it's like exactly what Jesus is doing and it's a particular twist of the knife because remember we've talked about the Pharisees. What's their game plan? What are they going for with everything? They want to promote a national rigid righteousness that is so absolute that there will be no lapses, there will be no mistakes and God will definitely bless his people this time if we just clamp down on them and get their bad behavior under control. Also if there are a few perks on the side for us and we get to sit at the fancy tables and get to be called cool honorific titles and if we make a few bucks and if we can just kind of work the law in such a way that it always favors the habits we have and always doesn't favor the habits that people aren't in power have, that would just be a little bit of kickback that might happen to happen and we don't even actually acknowledge that we actually do that even though we totally do. By alluding to a passage like that from Jeremiah 23, Jesus is implicitly saying in a way the original audience would have understood that not just woe to you because you're shutting doors in people's faces and you don't greet them enough when they come to your churches or things like that to use the modern example we started with. But woe to you because you're like the people who blew this in the first place and you think you're so much better and you learned stuff but you haven't learned anything. The rebuke that the Lord had for the religious leaders back then who got everything wrong that resulted in God punishing his chosen people through the power of Babylon. So you are making the same mistakes and if anything you're making them even worse because you've already seen what those mistakes do once and the existence of your entire job and social religious class is predicated on you guys being the do over that's going to get it right this time and protect us from making the same mistakes we made before and so that we can get into the kingdom of heaven but you're actually shutting the door to the kingdom of heaven and you guys aren't even in there yourselves. This is a mass. Do you remember that scene in Lion King where Simba and Nala are getting run off into the elephant graveyard lands and the hyenas are there and they're like, we're going to eat you and it was all because of scars, clever planning and then Mufasa comes along and smacks the hyenas around and Nala and Simba and Mufasa get away and Mufasa is like, I'm going to teach my son a lesson. And his little ears go down and then scar goes and talks to the hyenas. He's like, I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you. Now, just imagine that instead of scar being a horrible awful villain in this example, imagine that he's like good because Jesus here is pretty much giving that speech. Like, what do you want me to do? What do you want my father to do? We put you in this position. You sit in Moses's seat as is stated a little bit earlier in chapter 23. You have all of this history and pedigree. You have all of these tangible examples of the work of God. You have an entire people dedicated to you. You have the temple. It should be the easiest thing in the world for you to just eat the cubs. Nup, the analogy breaks down a little bit when I say it like that. It should be the easiest thing in the world for you to open the doors to the kingdom of heaven. I've gift wrapped the situation for you to make that evident and you can't get that right. And not only can you not get that right for yourselves, you can't get that right for the people I've entrusted you with. Again, very much opposite in tone from the scene in the Lion King, but I think you're tracking with what I'm saying. This first woe then is evocative of stuff that these guys, ancient forerunners got wrong while operating in the same position. Further, this first woe is a withering indictment of their inability to get their simple singular job and get it right and how not only do they not get it right passively by just doing nothing, they instead are actively doing the opposite of their job, both to their own souls and to the souls of others. And finally, this first woe exists at least for us as modern readers looking at the text as a direct contrast with how Jesus has held himself out. These guys heap these heavy burdens on you. These guys make this stuff difficult. These guys put up all of these boundaries to understanding into the kingdom of heaven. And then Matthew 11 28 through 30 kind of sums up Jesus stance and what it's like when he talks about the kingdom and accessibility to it. He says, come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I'll give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I'm gentle and humble in heart and you'll find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light. Look, whether you're talking about a church that has just forgotten the reason it exists or a church that's full of people who forgot what it was like when they weren't Christians or can no longer conceive of how hard it would be for somebody to walk into that building, especially in this moment in time in this political climate. Look, grace to them. Peace to them. Get it. It's easy to get this stuff wrong. I get this stuff wrong. Everybody can get this stuff wrong. And likewise to these Pharisees, they had a club, they had a social circle. Nobody's really making the decisions anymore. Become self proliferating. It becomes a cultural mess as much as an individual mass grace to them as well. If I lived during this time knowing my personality traits, I probably would have been on their team and I probably would have been contributing to the mass and going falling at these outrageous things that Jesus was saying to us as he called out our little club. But all of that said, and even though I want forgiveness for the not welcoming church and the not welcoming Pharisees the same way, I want forgiveness for me and for you, my friends. So we still got a deal in the matter of reality and truth. It looks like they really were missing the point. And if anybody was rightly positioned to call them out for missing the point, that is Jesus. Real quick, I noticed a handful of you jumped on and signed up to support the program on Patreon over the last week or so here. Man, that means a lot. Thank you. This is a weird thing we're doing. It seems like really obvious is to talk about the Bible on the internet. But for whatever reason, as it turns out, our conversation that we're having here is actually kind of weird and unique. And it's the kind of thing that continues to make sense and work really well because some of you are like, I don't have to pay for this, but I'm going to kick in on it anyway. Golly, that means a ton. It's encouraging. It's helpful. Thank you. I appreciate it to anybody whether they support the show or not. Just thanks for being here either way. But to those of you who are supporting the program, wow, thank you so very, very much for doing so. All right. More next time around, I'm Matt. It's the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
