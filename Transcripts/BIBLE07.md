 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about judging. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. We are working our way through the entire Bible right now, one book per day until we're done. And today we're looking at judges. This is a doozy. This is a book that reminds me of the saying, don't meet your heroes. You've heard that cautionary remark, the truism. It just means that if you get too close to people you admire from afar, you see their humanity, you see their flaws without the Photoshop and the auto tune and the speech writers. And it can be pretty unflattering when you see your heroes in a true and unbiased light. Well, with judges, when I was a kid, I read through this book very much with the mindset of the heroes or whoever's on screen, a good guy, bad guy, comic book kind of reading. And as I've gone back to this book as an adult who's lived a little bit in the real world and who's read a little bit more Bible, I'm now able to better see how flawed pretty much literally every single character in this book is. The people are not the heroes. The people are the objects of redemption. They have problems. The God character is the hero and he is the one who appears in all the different stories and he is the one who is choosing to redeem in spite of the behavior of run of the male people and oftentimes in spite of the very people who claim to love him and serve him. Judges represents the moment where we really spiral all the way down the toilet here in terms of what we see happening on screen. This is an awful story and I guess I could just keep saying, oh, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, or I can just tell you about it. The name of the book, Judges, is derived from the office, I suppose you could call it, that the main characters of this book hold. They aren't like the kind of people who are enforcing a complex set of laws. I don't think any of these people are even elected. They're just regional leaders who can get a following and who all have massive character flaws, but God uses them to deliver his people even though on paper they seem pretty undeserving of that deliverance. So Judges, I mean everybody forever who's commented on this book agrees that the structure is shaped like a spiral and probably a spiral pointing downward. You get a situation where the Israelite people just don't do what they pledged they were going to do so boldly and so repeatedly. But the end of Joshua, remember, Joshua was like, Hey, me and my house, we're going to serve the Lord, you ought to do the same. And they're all like, yeah, for sure, we're going to, and I didn't say this when we were going through Joshua, but Joshua responds to that. Like you are testifying against yourselves right now, tread lightly my friends, because I don't think you're actually going to do that. And they're like, no, we're totally going to do it. And he's like, are you though? Cause it seems like you don't and you're not going to do that. And they're like, we are totally going to do it. Let's carve a rock. And so then they carve a rock. I guess that means that now they're going to do it, but they totally ignore the rock. So in Judges, the narrative cycle is the people of God do bad stuff. They act like the Canaanites instead of acting different from the Canaanites. Then just like the deal that God made with Moses, I'm going to be your God. You're going to be my people and everybody's going to know it because if you obey me, I'm going to bless you. And if you disobey me, I'm going to punish you in keeping with that covenant. God lets different oppressors come along and put their boot on the neck of the Israelite people in different regions. And then eventually the Israelite people are really sad about it and they cry out to God. And they're like, we're super sorry. Please help us deliver us from this oppressor. And then God preserving his own glory, preserving his own redemptive plan, preserving and honoring the unconditional covenant he made with Abraham delivers them. And then things are better for a period of time. So we get done with this prologue that explains why things are going to go south. And then we get introduced to a series of different judges. Seven of the 12 judges get three verses of screen time or less. So you hear about Othnil, Shamgar, Tola, Jair, Ibsan, Elon, and Abdan only very briefly. But these other characters, Ehud, Deborah, Gideon, Jeptha, and Samson get a lot of screen time comparatively. Now as first three judges, we don't get a sense of the complete moral mess here because the coverage is so succinct, but judges is very juicy at times. You can almost smell it if you read it closely enough. For example, the story of Ehud, the author goes out of his way to say that the king, Ehud, stabbed, was stabbed so well and so hard that he emptied his bowels when all of that happened. The story of Deborah ends with some guy's wife coaxing a fugitive king who was a former oppressor of Israel into a tent and she acts like she's going to be nice to him. And as soon as she gets him to fall asleep with some delicious warm milk, she pounds a giant metal tent peg through his brain and then calls in the Israelites like there he is. Nailed to the ground. That's him right there. This is pretty grizzly already. And it feels a little bit morally icky and weird even in the early going, but then we meet Gideon. Gideon is a weak man who doesn't really believe God and wants to cover all of his bases before he'll take any risk or do anything. Still though, he obtains these great victories, but it goes right to his head. He becomes addicted to killing people and gets wildly murderous. And then in an episode that echoes, I mean, really closely echoes that of the golden calf in Exodus at Mount Sinai. He collects a bunch of gold from the spoils of those he's defeated and he hasn't made into like a gold priest get up. They call it an ephod and Israel ends up worshiping that and it's an absolute embarrassment. Then there's this crude gang leader who lives way out in the hill country. Israel's being oppressed. They can't come up with anybody else to help him out after this cycle runs again. His name is Jeptha. So they come to him and they're like, well, will you be a gang leader on our behalf instead? And so Jeptha goes and defeats the Ammonites, but then he makes some weird vow and the weird vow is that he promises God that he's going to sacrifice whatever comes out of the house to meet him first if he's given victory over the Ammonites. Of course, it's going to be his daughter and surprise. It's his daughter. And so what we see there is that even this person who's supposed to be judge and leader over Israel has no idea how God is. That's the kind of oath you would make to a Canaanite God. And then it looks like he keeps that vow. Some people will try to come up with some very, very slippery way of being like, no, it was actually this other thing. But I think the folks who are reading it that way are frankly too concerned with trying to recast these judges as heroes when in fact, even the people who God uses to deliver the Israelites are really obviously, if we just take an objective, look at it very, very flawed. And none more so than Samson, whose story has echoes that move forward and backwards in the Bible. There's like a jillion points of story rhyming throughout the book of judges, but probably the greatest concentration of elements and motifs and themes that just sound like they're plucked from all these other parts of the Bible happens in the Samson story where we get a birth that echoes the miraculous births at the beginning of Luke, Elizabeth and Mary. And we get an ascension that looks almost like Jesus' ascension at the end of Luke beginning of acts. But morally, it's absolute complete and total chaos. And then we get this little appendix, this bonus stuff at the end of the book between chapters 17 and 21, where there are two absolutely horrible incidents, including the one that opened my eyes to adult readings of the Bible, that being the story of Israel's civil war when through a series of events, a concubine ends up getting cut up into a whole bunch of pieces, then sent to all the different parts of Israel, I'm serious. And then all the different tribes come together and declare war against another tribe, but they overdo it and they make rash vows. And so to kind of undo, maybe they're over punishing of that tribe after God lets them suffer losses themselves for two days, almost as if to say like you have culpability here as well, before I let you bring justice to the tribe that did this horrible thing. And when all of that is said and done, they've made so many mistakes and how they prosecute that punishment. And they've so unjustly executed their justice and judgment against this one tribe, that they end up solving their problem by letting them abscond with other people's women, essentially making forced wives and slaves out of them is very disturbing from beginning to end. But it's not an even level of disturbing. That toilet spiral analogy, I think, is legit. In the end, the people of Israel only a relatively small amount of time removed from the exodus and the conquest look just like the people they were supposed to replace. They have the values of the Canaanites. They think like Canaanites. They conceive of their God like a Canaanite God. And the result is the bloodshed and the madness and the chaos that the Canaanites had experienced. If God could be mocked, this would almost make a mockery of God and call into question his judgment. Why would you replace the Canaanites for their wickedness, with just this other version of identical wickedness? The last verse of the book of Judges is chapter 21 verse 25. In those days, there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes. Everything has gone off the rails. That system of moral thought, especially saturated in Canaanite, thought it's not going to work. And so it begs for some kind of authority to step in and provide leadership. The people of Israel have rejected the theocracy. They don't want God as king. They want to chase after foreign gods and foreign values. And so now to keep them from destroying themselves and dismembering the redemptive plan that is the whole point here. Remember, it looks like a king is going to have to come on the scene. But as we're going to discover, kings come with all kinds of problems. And as we come to encounter these flawed kings, it will make us beg for the next thing that we need, which is a perfect benevolent king who never dies and never goes away and never gets replaced. It seems like that's kind of too much to ask for, but increasingly it's becoming clear. We need something like that to solve the problem of the human heart that we're encountering through these first seven books of the Bible. When you visualize the profoundly unfun book of Judges, picture Samson toppling that temple on top of everybody, it was just a glorious metaphor for the whole thing, judgment and mess all around there. When you think about the theme, reflect on Israel rejecting God. And really, this just being a microcosm of the way humanity rejects God. Finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to check out Judges two, 16 through 19, because it kind of spells out who the judges are. Make sure to also check out Judges 13 through 16. That's chapters 13 through 16, because you get the whole Samson story, which again, I think gives you a sense of the whole book and how each of these cycles with the judges works. And then finally, make sure to catch the very end judges 21 to 25 that little bit that I just read you. I guess we're going to call that a level up, but it's a dark level up. You know what isn't dark though? What we get next, Ruth is really, really good. And the tone shift that we get going into Ruth next time around is so welcome after what we just went through with judges. So I'm excited about that. All right, I'm Matt.
