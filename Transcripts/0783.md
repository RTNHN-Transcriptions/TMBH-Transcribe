 Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and you start Star Wars episode four and you just got some blonde haired 70s looking kid out on some desert planet and they're space wizards and they got laser swords and there's an empire and they got like a moon thing. They can blow up planets. What the heck is going on? You know what in 1977 or whatever that came out, we all just leaned into it. We're like, great. Sure, cool. We just accept that we're here and this is how the things are. Now George Lucas went back and decided to do the prequels. What he had to do was take three movies and just get us right to the setup point. Now ultimately Rogue One is really the movie that takes us right to the beginning of episode four, the very first thing you ever see in Star Wars, but the table is set when you come out of the prequels and then Rogue One for the original trilogy. If you're not in Star Wars, you know what I mean? That's okay. Here's the actual point that I'm driving at. Nice. Matthew kind of needs to leave us in a place where we got the fork in the road where we have the setup that we've known for the last 2000 years and that that setup, that tension is okay. Nobody was ever able to find Jesus body. A whole lot of people believe Jesus came back to life. A whole religion, the most significant one, the most influential one the world has ever seen was born out of it. It continues to grow all the time and to be going unbelievably strong. Sure, it ebbs and flows in different cultures, but boy, oh boy, is it flowing right now in the developing world, in the East, in China, even if in the West, the church doesn't seem to be having its best day right this moment. This thing is still on this eternally upward trajectory. Some people look at that and they're like, well, it's because Jesus came back to life and that's the narrative and that's what happened. That's how I look at it, but there has to be some other narrative. You got to have some alternative to what to do with it. The alternative is somebody messed with the body to try to trick people into thinking this thing was real. We see right here in Matthew 28, the passage we've been looking at the last couple of days, the origin of this setup, this 2,000 years of historical tension over what to do with Jesus is really left in place. If you've made your way through Matthew 28, verses 11 through 15, you now pretty much have the historical setup for what people have done with Jesus are wrestled with regarding Jesus for the last couple thousand years and that intrigues me. So we've been taking a little bit of time to work that through and we're going to pick up where we left off yesterday in the conversation. I'm going to have Jeff play a little music and we'll just keep going with the same flow I thought we've been working on on all of this. We've been talking a lot lately about bookends and how chapter 28 seems to have a whole lot of them really middle of 27 on as a whole lot of bookends. Matthew gives us stuff on the front side of passion week, the crucifixion, etc. Then he gives us a bunch of stuff on the backside that rounds it out. Clearly it's meant to highlight a point. It's meant to complete character arcs. Some of those bookends obviously will go all the way back to the beginning of Matthew as well, but that theme of witnesses is coming up again here and that one is played heavily of late, right? Really from chapter 16, chapter 17 on the theme of witnesses has been a very big deal and it was present even before that multiple times. We've got two people, even at one point people who can't see coming to Jesus and being like, you are the real deal and you are the son of David and we see who you are. I mean, heck, even demons get that one right. But in 17, now you got witnesses who've seen Jesus in his transfigured form. This is how he actually appears and what he is and what he looks like. And now those witnesses are ready to go out into the world and now we get into Jerusalem and people are witnesses to all this stuff Jesus is doing and saying it's happening in front of everybody and the witnesses are the little children who out of the mouth of babes speak truth about Jesus as the son of David and they recognize him for the Messiah that he is. But the Pharisees bear false witness. They can't see it. And then in chapter 23, Jesus calls them out for being fans of false witnesses. Then that accusation is completed is made obvious in chapter 26 at the Kangaroo court trial when the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. But they don't find any though they had many false witnesses come forward. And finally to come forward and they declare this fella said, I'm able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days. Then the high priest stands up and says to Jesus, what do you do that? Now the paraphrase is mine and Jesus affirms. Yes, it is as you say, when the high priest charges him to admit whether or not he's the son of God, Jesus bears true witness, even though it's costly in opposition to the false witness that we see right next to that with the religious leaders and the false witnesses. And then theatrically, of course, the religious leaders dare their clothes and all we simply cannot abide this. And then we get another witness theme with Peter. Like he'll be faithful as a witness, right? Nope. He lies. He denies things. He bears false witness right after that. Really the only true witness who we see in all of this in a steady sense is the women. And then Joseph Verimathea and Nicodemus, of course, pop right here at the end as true and faithful witnesses alongside Gentile witnesses, the centurion and those who were helping to carry out the execution. They bear true witness. And then of course, the women once again at the tomb bear true witness. Now we get the book end on the whole witness thing, or I should say almost the final book end with the guards also bearing true witness until they get paid to bear false witness. But I just continue to be absolutely delighted by the way, this whole scheme to suppress truth and advance misinformation on the part of the religious leaders in Matthew 27 when they went and appealed to pilot for a sealed tomb with guards around it. They just totally boomerangs on them. They get meat clumps all over their face because they were trying to control a narrative. They could not control their mess on with something that the text holds out as just being much, much bigger than their political power or their schemes. In the end, what we see is that everybody goes down doing more or less what they were doing all along. The women were faithful all along. Pilot was scattered and distracted and operating out of fear all along. The religious leaders were manipulative and willing to use money and political manipulation to buy influence to defeat this thing because they didn't like Jesus as a threat to their role as mediator all along. The religious leaders oppressed true prophets all along. The crowd was squishy and fickle all along. The disciples believed but were weak and afraid and easily broken all along. That one is going to get a little different resolution. And that's what we start to see as we get into the final question of witness, the final element in this ongoing motif of witness as we get toward the end of chapter 28, which we're not quite to yet. We're still dealing with a little bit more guard stuff I think that I want to talk about. Do we need to? Maybe we will. Maybe we will. I'm not going to make any promises coming out of this one as to where we go tomorrow. But the final point in Matthew chapter 28 is going to be Jesus literally using the word witness. Guys, you've seen it. You blew it. We're here now. Go bear faithful witness to what you've seen. He tells them to go and make disciples of all nations and baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. He's going to promise to be with them all the way to the end of the age. Yeah, I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit. But before we wrap up here today, the final verse in this little passage says, so the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. This is certainly not the most elaborate scheme and really it demonstrates the impotence of the Pharisees position in the end. All they're left with is to take a couple of unreliable, gentile witnesses who they would reject his witnesses themselves, buy them off and have them go and circulate this story as vigorously as possible to try to desperately make a play to hold on to their power. Does it make sense? Does it check out? I don't think it does. And apparently history doesn't think it does because, well, Christianity worked out and here we are 2,000 years later still talking about it. And you can say, oh, that's because the Catholic Church got all that power and they brought everybody to heal and they made people do what they wanted and stuff. You hear people say stuff like that, but the Catholic Church, no church had that kind of power for centuries upon centuries upon centuries after this stuff went down. In order for this story of the resurrection of Jesus to have made it past the proverbial breakers, like how Tom Hanks had to get past those initial waves to get out to sea when he was trying to get off the island and cast away. In order for this to make it past the historical breakers, it had to be credible to the original audience. There had to be a story here that didn't make sense, that being the guards report and what they're circulating on the behest of the Pharisees and Sadducees. There had to be a version of the story that did make sense that caught people's attention and that was something they tracked with more and repeated more and leaned into more, even though the powerful people were telling them to believe this other version of the story. I keep wanting to tackle everything right now. We're going to get to that in a future conversation not too far down the road. Final thing. This episode, as has been the case with several episodes of late, is sponsored by Samaritan Ministries. This is a great idea. There's a reason I've been talking about it a lot. It's because this is something we do and that we did long before they have sponsored this program here. The Samaritan Ministries is a community of Christians who help pay each other's medical bills without the use of insurance. It's a very affordable solution to paying for healthcare costs. It starts at 99 bucks for an individual, 263 for a family of three. The way it works is super simple. You have something happen or you go receive medical care, then you take that bill and you submit it to Samaritan Ministries, and then they have other members of the community send you checks to pay your medical bills. It's that simple. You get money from other actual humans. The corporate touch on this is very, very minimal and light. That's a big part of why costs stay so low with all of it. It's also part of why there's so much freedom and flexibility in terms of what you do, getting the healthcare from the doctors that make sense for you and your family because I think you know best on that stuff. So if you want to learn more, you can go to SamaritanMinistries.org slash TMBH. It's been an awesome fit for my family. Think it might be for years as well. Thanks in advance for considering checking that out. All right. We're going to look more at how effective this story was that Matthew says was circulated in the next couple of conversations. Pick it up from there. All right. And that is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
