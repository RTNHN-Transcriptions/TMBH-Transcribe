 Hey Dylan, are you listening to that Weird You Out Dylan? I don't mean you Dylan, not that Dylan, the other Dylan. DJ Weaver 29, that Dylan? Yeah, you said something really smart in the subreddit buddy. It was a great question and I'm going to read that question right now and then we're going to talk about it as we're processing this whole Matthew chapter 4 things. Here we go. You asked Dylan, hey Matt and others, I was wondering what your thoughts were about the writing of Matthew chapter 4. With previous chapters, things were of public record or had other witnesses. But with this chapter, it's just Jesus and Satan. Do you feel that this was a story Jesus told its disciples? Was it passed down through the spirit? Basically, how did this very personal and scheduled event make its way in the scripture? Secluded event, excuse me. I understand from a literary perspective why it's here but I'm struggling to grasp the mechanics. I like this question. Also with the vagueness of Satan, the serpent Lucifer being really unclear in the Old Testament, did Matthew have a real understanding of what was going on here? If things are inspired by the spirit, did any of the authors fully grasp what they were writing? I realize it's going to be speculative but I'm still interested in your thoughts as well as any helpful church tradition. Thanks a bunch Dylan or DJ Weaver 29 as he calls himself on the Reddit's Dylan. Nice question man. We're going to take a whole episode and talk about that right now. And by we, since you addressed it to Hey, Matt and others, I mean me and my buddy, Aaron Utect, Aaron, I got you there. I am here. Sweet. Not everybody might know my friend Aaron Utect but you know how all of you probably have somebody who you call when you have windshield time and like your area of specialization and what you think about and you call them up and you bounce ideas off of each other. If you don't have that friend, you should get one but you can't have Aaron. He's already taken. He's the guy I call to process all of this stuff behind the scenes with Bible and theology and all of this. Okay. So Aaron, what do you say to Dylan? How did this stuff get recorded from Matthew chapter four where Jesus is out in the wilderness? Mono, we mono with the devil. That is a great question. I have not ever thought about that before. I think it's been a category though of like at the end of the ureonomy or a record, the death of Moses and clearly somebody has somebody has come along and put those together but Moses is still credited with it. It seems like it's kind of in that category. Like there were there's obviously private moments that somehow got brought to light. What I would assume in this case is that Jesus is explained this to his disciples who probably took notes on a lot of stuff along the way and and then wrote him down in various various forms and various gospel camps. Can I ask you questions to push back on this to make the conversation more fun? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And to be fair, like everybody needs to understand Aaron was not prepped for any of this. I told him no minutes ago, hey, I'm going to turn on microphone. I want you to answer your questions. So, so I'm being rough on you here, but I know you're good for it. Do you think it would be arrogant of Jesus to sit his disciples down and be like, yeah, I'm the humble son of man and the suffering servant and my boat, my burden and yoke, you know, they're not so heavy or anything. And also here's some awesome stuff I did to crush the devil one time or do you think we're like, oh, tell us, tell us the story again, Jesus about the time you kicked the devil's butt out in the desert and that verbal sword fight. Is that arrogant to him to tell this story? That's an interesting question. So I think the answer has to be no, but how do you arrive at that? I think there's an interesting, okay, let me fill me back up. If you take the, if you take the Bible narrative that G presents Jesus as the son of God. And so Jesus, what's true of God then is also true of Jesus. Now, one of the things that's interesting is you go through like the Old Testament and the records of God, he is infinite. He's infinitely loving, infinitely just, infinitely powerful, also infinitely merciful. I mean, he's, he's infinite in all these different directions. And I think one of those interesting juxtapositions that isn't always talked about is that God is for his glory, but also humble. And so like if you look at Psalm 113, let's just, who's like the Lord our God, or sits and turned on high, but stoops down to list slowly that, that word is the same word used if Jesus in, in the Greek Old Testament that Paul uses in 14 step or two, where he humbled himself or stooped down. So is it arrogant of him to talk about that in that moment or from that moment? I think he's giving them a record of this cosmic event. And even though sometimes Jesus points to his glory, he also is probably the most deferential human ever. Is that understanding it? Well, certainly in relation to awesomeness level, yeah, like it's not a big deal to be deferential if you're terrible at everything. I mean, it's certainly a bigger deal to be differential if you're the best at everything ever. I'm assuming Jesus would have been the best at like golf and juggling and yoga, probably also as well, because of him being, you know, God in the flesh and everything. So yeah, I support your statement. Okay. All right. So and side note, I think you quoted that verse exactly right, dude. Psalm 113 five and six, who is like the Lord our God? The one who's thrown on high, who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth. And yes, I had to look that up. So nice job props to you. Thank you. Okay. So we're in agreement that barring some kind of supernatural revelation that happened after the fact, this must have been something that one of two entities told others is either the devil or it was Jesus. And since the devil comes off looking horrible, we don't have any other record of him showing up to inform the narrative of scripture with its authors. We're going to assume it must the leak must have been Jesus, right? Fair assumption. I think so. Yes. And the motivation for that isn't so much his telling his story as it is telling the story of the universe. This is how this is going down. Yeah. And the story of his father, right? I mean, yeah, you say he's differential and in a lot of ways, you know, the way I framed him like, Oh, look how awesome I am and what I did. But really, if you look at the story, Jesus doesn't look that awesome at all because he's weak. He's frail. He has to be attended to by things that his father provides. And all of his references are to the word of God. He doesn't say even to the word of me. He's deferring to God, the father. Yeah. He's referred to God, the spirit and even going out into the desert in the first place. So really even telling the story is an act of presenting to others what proper deference to God looks like, which is weird because if you or I do it, it's got all kinds of weird mixed motives. And here it doesn't seem to be the case. But yeah, yeah, that's all said. I think the weakness of the this was revealed independently by the Holy Spirit prophetically to there's there's some reference to the temptation in all four gospels. Let me see. Definitely Matthew, Mark, definitely in Luke. Does John have a reference? I am in my office. If you let me swear, but I can share. I don't think so. Like the only part of the Bible I've read are the first four chapters of Matthew. So I have no idea what happens after that. No, it does. I don't think there is because it jumps. It jumps right from the prologue, which is kind of detached esoteric language. And then it jumps right into the record of meaning, John the Baptist and John the Baptist testimony. So it seems like. Yeah. And then he calls disciples and then we're right into miracles and yeah, yeah, you're right. So for the sake of time, I think we're both comfortable saying that it would be not in keeping with the way the information in the gospels is assembled to imagine that the Holy Spirit separately and miraculously appears to Matthew, Mark and Luke individually to give them this one nugget of detail. It looks like they're drawing on a common source. And in this case, I would speculate, Dylan, that the common source is Jesus, the Christ of Nazareth, who was explaining what happened out there. And I don't think he was explaining it arrogantly. I think I think he's explaining something that really needs to be known for people to understand that he does pass all the tests that he is the son of God, that he is the promised redeemer, the promised king who would rule forever on this throne of David. And obviously if the whole Bible is happening and the whole redemptive plan is happening, he wants people to know that. So he would want to communicate it. So here's my question to you, Aaron, how do we know he's telling the truth? Like he's Jesus. So we like him and we automatically side with him. But if you're reading through this document for the first time and you don't know what to make of it, why would you assume that a pretty outlandish sounding story like that would be true and not that Jesus was just making stuff up? You can look to internal tests. You can look to the people who wrote it and say, are they trustworthy? But ultimately, I think it has to be, I'm going to accept this. And that's a little bit how God what puts it? Where you trust me? You know, faith is like a child in Luke 18, I think it is. Which you know is hard for me. Yeah, it's hard for all of us on a completely not screwing around, not joking level. Like, look, I want people to know who they're hearing from here. I have faith. I am a Christian. I believe in God. I believe that he's behind the Bible and the Bible is accurate and saying what it means to say. I don't, I'm not claiming I understand it all, but faith like a child, that's not really in my wheelhouse, man. It seems like there's a place in this whole story, in this whole kingdom of God thing for Thomas's and people who kind of poke and prod at it a little bit more. Yeah. I'm wired like that. And I know there are people who are listening who are wired a little more like that too. Oh, there are people you're talking to that are wired like that. Yeah. It's a big part of my story actually when I was in college sort of feeling like God owed me an answer on all my questions. And I kind of relinquished that right. For me personally. And I think it means that everything has to be blindly accepted. It means you have to kind of know he's God and he may have prorogatives that I don't fully know on the front end. I think that you could really over apply that verse about faith like a child, but it's core. I think it's about knowing that I have a place. So back to your question. In Matthew, how do we know that this isn't just made up somehow that the apostles made it up after the fact and the speech, the story together. Well, ultimately, I mean, there's good reasons to believe that that didn't happen. And reasonable people will come to different conclusions, but ultimately you're going to say, you know, everything points to this document and the people who put it together seem like they're all internally consistent and they're all going in the same direction and they don't have they would lose too much by trying to make it up. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of mean. I mean, I think there's an element of faith that that comes to play in it, really. Yeah, that's compelling to me as well. And I would just add to your list, I guess. I mean, you got these accounts about Jesus. You have reason. You have philosophy. You have the scriptures. You have the Old Testament. There's there's a whole lot of stuff that goes into deciding whether or not you believe Jesus told the truth about what happened out there. If I saw this story in isolation and somebody named like Gary was out there and is like, Hey, guess who I just ran into after 40 days of going on a vision quest and then I would move on from Gary. And with no other context, I'm sorry, Gary just doesn't sound very credible there. But with Jesus, I feel like this is one of those places where the more clear of all the other stuff about him and his character and what he did and his motivations, all of that informs whether we can trust him to come back and tell us what actually happened out there in the desert or not. Yeah. And so I'm good with it. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a collective argument. You know, you said, Okay, he does this. Okay, he's, he's obviously not, you know, not trying to lead rebellion. He's not claiming wild things to try to make money or get women. You know, I mean, all of the collective story, it's a collective way to it. Yeah. And for me, as I work through the New Testament, if I were to run into an account or an issue that would cause me to say, I don't know if I can go there, it wouldn't be this one. It wouldn't be did Jesus report this accurately or not? And at this point, you know, we don't have time for me to disclose what the harder parts are. So for me, it'd be somewhere else. And as we get to those things in the text, it'll be fun to break them down and talk about the challenges that come with it and also the awesome stuff that comes with it. Dude, you just jumped on the phone with me with no preparation and completely crushed it. It's as though you're good at this stuff. Thank you. It's fun to talk and think about. I have no idea if it's profound on the other end or not, but it's fun to do. Thank you, Aaron, for jumping on Dylan. Nice job. That was a fantastic question and hopefully scratches a mental itch that some other people had as well. If anybody else wants to jump in on the discussion like that, you can go to Reddit.com.
