 Okay, we need to talk right now. In my preparation for this conversation, I was doing a tiny little bit of Googling, and that painting by Edward Munch came up that's called The Scream. You can picture it. It's all nightmarish and horrifying. And you get the guy with his hands and sides face like, ah, things are terrible or whatever. Somebody just pointed out that it looks like a cock or spaniel. And I was like, no, it doesn't. It looks like the totally looks like a cock or spaniel, like just a really mediocre painting of a cock or spaniel. And I was like, ah, it's a great painting. I don't want to see the cock or spaniel. I want to see the person screaming again so that I can feel some kind of connection across the generations in terms of existential angst with that Vard Munch. And then I look again, I'm like, no, no, it's just an adorable cock or spaniel on maybe a bridge or something, enjoying a beautiful sunset. It's like a boardwalk in Yellowstone. It's actually a really lovely painting that doesn't make me feel any angst at all. And the thing that's hilarious here is it ruined the painting for me. And a lot of people say stuff like that, they're like, man, the Star Wars equals ruined Star Wars for me. What didn't ruin your childhood? It didn't ruin Star Wars. It just wasn't that good. But this is different. The painting is ruined because it is not physically possible for me to unsee what I've just seen. There's been a physiological rewiring of my brain and forever. The scream is now that cock or spaniel on that bridge in Yellowstone at sunset and it's just how things are now. Likewise, when we get to Matthew chapter 12 and Jesus is talking about this sign of Jonah stuff with the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who are demanding to see a miraculous sign, he says, all right, you asked for this miraculous sign, but none's going to be given except for the sign of the prophet Jonah. And then all of us are like, what? It's clue. And we got to try and figure out what the clue is. And that's what we're going to work on today. But as soon as we find out what the answer to the clue is and as soon as we see how Jesus is going to be, the fulfillment of this sign of the imagery that is cast forward through history from the well known to the original audience and beloved story of Jonah, as soon as we see how the Jonah details connect with the Jesus details, there will be no unseeing it. And look in a second here, as we unpack what the obvious connections are between Jonah and Jesus and where this is all headed, whether you're religious or not, whether you've been around the Bible in detail or not, you're going to be like, well, that's all actually incredibly obvious. Anybody could see that. Yeah, but not in Matthew chapter 12. All of this is still brand new. The spoilers haven't happened yet. This is like opening night. Word hasn't gotten around. People would have been in heightened suspense wanting to know how the one sign that the Pharisees are going to be given to prove that the whole Jesus thing is what Jesus says the Jesus thing is about is the sign of Jonah. So let's pretend that we are them and join that original audience from across the centuries in being blown away at the connections that are being drawn and how those connections are going to play out. Last time around, we summarize Jonah. If you weren't here for that one, you might want to catch the last episode. It'll make this make more sense. And once again, Matthew 12, two Sabbath controversies, the Pharisees don't like the way those turn out. They decide they're going to kill Jesus. Jesus strategically withdraws. People follow Jesus out there anyway and they're like, could you heal this demon-possessed blind mute guy? Jesus is like, yep, sure could. And then everybody's like, whoa, you might be the Messiah, the son of David, but the Pharisees like, no, you're casting out demons by demons. And Jesus is like, that's stupid. And then he explains why. He's like, you guys are really wrong about things and the bad things that are inside you or what are bubbling to the surface there. And then the Pharisees look around and they're like, oh, everybody heard that. We look really bad. Well, I mean, it could be. You could just do a miraculous sign for us to prove that you are right about all these things. And everybody there surely is like, well, didn't he just do a miraculous sign? I mean, that would precipitate the whole event was he didn't miraculous sign and he didn't like the way the sign went and she started acting like this. I don't know. We'll see what Jesus says. And Jesus responds thusly. He answered Matthew 12, 39, a wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except for the sign of the prophet Jonah. When we looked at this the other day, I kind of glossed over that word adulterous, but it would have conjured in the mind of the original audience and in the mind of a lot of people. Now, the reference to the minor prophet, Josea. Josea is one of the few prophets that is built around a little bit of a story. There's a narrative here. There's a word picture and the sign of the prophet, Josea, if you will, is that Jesus is like, go marry this lady. She has a real smoking hot, sexy name, Gomer. And then once you two are all married up and everything, she's going to be unfaithful a lot. Your job is going to be to go and get her back. And this is a metaphor for God's stubbornness in being redemptive toward Israel and toward the larger world in general. So even in calling them an adulterous generation, he is one digging them about their own disappointing history and how God is the one who has to constantly do the work because they are unfaithful, like, hey, it's Bible. No offense. You got kids having plugged their ears and scream if you want. The book of Josea is likening the unfaithfulness of the Jewish people to the unfaithfulness of a prostitute. So on the one hand, it's a pretty withering reminder of where we've been in the past. But on the other hand, there's also hope here because there's redemption in that story of Josea. And the main point of the story isn't look how awful Gomer was. The main point of the story is look at how under the prompting of God, Josea is literally redeeming the situation. He has to go buy back his own wife out of sex slavery. That's a tough check to write, but he writes it anyway. And look, some checks are tougher to write than others. Like, I don't like paying for parking. I don't like paying for air to put in my tires. I don't like paying for bottled water, but nobody wants to write a check to buy their wife back at a voluntary sex slavery. And this whole Josea and Gomer motif is really a pretty beautiful picture of the character of God and his insistence on redeeming messy things will sow is Jonah. So noting that moving to verse 40, the sign of Jonah. For his Jonah, this is Jesus talking, was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish. So the son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. All right, let's start making the connections. This shouldn't be too tough because we've cheated ahead and we know the story. Three days and three nights in the belly of the earth, three days and three nights in the belly of the fish. All right. It's certain death, right? Or it is death. Then maybe Jonah did die in the fish and was resurrected. Maybe it's just a word picture. I don't know. But even though that image is pretty straightforward for us because we know how this works out. Jesus dies. He's dead for a period of time. And then he's resurrected. There was no indication of that yet in the book of Matthew. So you and I get to that and we're like, aha, a clue. There it is. It's solved. That's what the sign of Jonah is. But the original audience would have been like, okay, I guess I don't totally see the connection, but you're acting like that should be sort of aha-ish. I don't know because nothing has been said yet in the book of Matthew about the son of man dying on the cross. That stuff starts to pick up in the second half of the document, but we're just not there yet. So this is going to fly by people a little bit. Surely a lot of folks sat and wrestled with it and debated it. I'm sure some people maybe even read the hints and the clues in Easter eggs and Easter egg. That in itself was an Easter egg. See what I did there? They were able to connect the dots, but most people probably would have missed that. Now there are a couple of mild controversies here that are at least worth acknowledging. Friday is when Jesus theoretically is crucified. Sunday is theoretically when Jesus is raised from the dead. Understandably some people look at that and they're like, I don't think that literally translates to three days and three nights, but it looks like it's pretty well established that this was an expression. We would lump together something from vaguely after lunch on Friday to sometime in the early morning of Monday as a weekend, unless maybe there was a holiday and then it extends it. Likewise, the three day three nights thing is an expression and in the Jewish rendering, all kinds of sources seem to agree that if you tick any part of a day or any part of a night that accounts for a day, a night and you can add it up that way. The point is if he was doing this in 21st century Omaha, Nebraska, he would have picked a different expression because we think about time a little bit differently, but it communicated what it was meant to communicate to this audience. So the sign of Jonah connects on the three days of apparent death and resurrection thing. The belly of the earth, the belly of the fish. Okay. He's spelling that stuff out pretty clearly, but then there's also the question of why. Why did the whole Jonah thing happen? Well, ultimately it was to position Jonah properly to have this massive act of grace and avoidance of judgment occur for the people of Nineveh. They had this horrible fate coming and there's this whole thing unfolding. They don't even know it's unfolding out and probably the Mediterranean Sea or maybe the Black Sea somewhere. And then all of a sudden like that thing happened. They didn't even know what happened and the judgment is spared on them. They don't know the mechanics or the details of how it happened, but something amazing occurred there and a giant act of grace is on the other end. They are spared destruction. They are not Jews. The story of Jonah is one that puts the Gentiles and the chosen people or a chosen person in the same room and likewise. And this is very evident from everything we've looked at so far in Matthew, the whole Jesus thing, his life, his death, his resurrection, all of that is very much meant to put the non chosen people, the Gentiles and the chosen people, the Jews in the same room is dealing with the same problem that all the people of the world, regardless of their ethnic background, have that being the problem of our own sin and the sin that is all around us, the brokenness, the entropy, the second law of thermodynamics, everything that is worn out and broken down about the world. But in addition to the Jew Gentile, this is for everybody kind of thing. It's also important to note that Jesus doesn't use the term. You will be given the miracle of Jonah. He goes with the sign language that the Pharisees and the teachers of the law asked him for. And running with that, he says, all right, here's the sign that you're going to get. Well, the difference between a miracle and a sign is that a miracle is just a breaking of the laws of time and space, but it only becomes a sign when you understand what it means. Now, in that regard, I think pretty much every miracle or cluster of miracles that the gospel authors choose to include in the text is a sign. It serves as a sign because it's advancing our understanding of the character of Jesus and the redemptive work of Jesus, the plan of God, et cetera. And here because Jesus is using the word sign, we got to have our antenna out for what does or what will this thing that we can't unsee, this sign of Jonah in Jesus' life? What will that teach us about the character of God? Well, what is the Jonah thing teaches us about the character of God? He's annoyingly long-suffering and patient to people who are judgmental and grouchy and want to burn things down. The Pharisees have the attitude of Jonah. They're mad about God's grace and redemption and they seem to want to withhold that from people. But Jesus deviates from the prophet Jonah on this point. He didn't get thrown into the sea. He wasn't forced to be swallowed by the fish. He was in on the plan the whole time, whereas Jonah was out on the plan. Effectively the whole time. And then Jonah even griped when God ultimately did the gracious thing that he was going to do, whereas Jesus is excited about. He is willing to lay down his life to accomplish the gracious thing that his father wants to do. So it is a sign not just in that it's like, oh, look, that looks like that other thing. And look, we're making connections here and we're connecting the dots. And that's interesting. And look at all the clues. They all point to this outcome. It's not just that. It's telling. We're supposed to look at the story of Jonah and come away saying that is important. That means something. And this tells us something, not just about what God is going to do, but why, who he is and what he's up to. And at this point in the text, Jesus has not yet finished unpacking the whole sign of Jonah thing. So we're not done either. So tomorrow we will continue down this road thinking more about the Nineveh thing and some other really interesting counterfactuals. If you don't remember what that word means, it's fine. We'll pick it up tomorrow and make sense of all of it. And in doing so, once we see how the sign of Jonah manifests in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, hopefully we will not be able to unsee it as I cannot unsee that cocker spaniel. It's messing with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
