 You're listening to the 10 Minute Bivalour Podcast where we do fast, fun, free daily deep dives into books of the Bible. And right now, we're going through Esther. Do you remember at the beginning of the Princess Bride when the grandpa character, played by Peter Falk, Colombo? He comes bursting into the room and laying in bed there's his grandson, played by young Fred Savage and the grandpa character goes over and he gives the kid a present that's all wrapped up and the kid sets aside his pixelated Atari 80s video game and he rips open the package and you can tell he's super disappointed to discover that the present he got was a book. And he says a book and then the grandpa's like, that's right. When I was your age, television was called books and then he goes on to explain that this is a special book that his father used to read to him and that he read to the kid's father and today I'm going to read it to you. And the kid still unimpressed like is it got any sports in it and the grandpa's like, are you kidding me? Fencing, fighting, some other stuff, giants, I think is in there. True love, that's definitely in there. And the kid's like, yeah, I'll try to stay awake and grandpa says, yeah, okay, well, thank you for your vote of confidence. Very inspiring. And the scene is funny and charming and well acted, well written and it gives us a sense of the dynamic between these two pals for the way that's going to play out for the rest of the movie and that's great. But the real take home, the really important thing from that scene is that we learned something about the grandpa and what he is there to accomplish. Sure, we just physically saw that book get unwrapped. But grandpa is there to unwrap this present for the first time that can only be metaphorically unwrapped once with his grandkid. Now you'll notice that grandpa sees this as a very generational thing. This story means something to us as a family and it's going to mean something to us far into the future. The kid doesn't understand that he's being handed a baton here, but he is being handed this baton. Well, look, at this point in my life, I am nobody's grandpa, but I do get to hang out with you as a peer and I kind of view this as an opportunity for you and I to unwrap a story that has been told for generations and to savor it together and to slowly and meticulously and carefully pick over all of the subtleties in it and appreciate them and reflect on them together. The story that I'm talking about, of course, is the Book of Esther. That's what this series is going to be on. Esther is the final historical book installment of the Old Testament. It's situated amongst all of the historical books. But despite that, I think there's something a little different going on with this book. You don't even really have to look that closely at it to get a sense that the feel of this is different. The plot beats, the unfolding of the story, the way the characters are presented. It's different than the other historical books. It's not the same thing as, like, say, first and second chronicles where you are getting an ancient world, best foot forward, historical chronicle to give you the facts in order with some light interpretation attached to it. Now, Esther feels like something that is rooted deeply in history, but that is present in the style of great storytelling. Now, we're going to have the opportunity in future conversations to talk about the implications of that compared with the rest of the Bible. What do you do with this little sub-genre of scripture that is Esther? I think those are going to be very fun conversations because it is so unique in terms of how it reads and where it sits and the effect that it has. So the grandpa in Princess Bride got to give his sales pitch about fencing and fighting and giants and true love and miracles. Miracles was on the list, too. And here's my list of things that I think make this awesome. One, I do love the historical era that we are about to jump into as we read the Book of Esther. It's not like anything else we see in the Bible. We're headed to ancient Persia where Persian culture dominated everything. It affected Hebrew culture. It affected storytelling and writing and how you do history and how you do politics. And there was a unique kind of court drama that happened in the Persian capitals of Persepolis and Sousa and Babylon and Ekbatana that you don't see happening in the northern Kingdom of Israel or in the southern Kingdom of Judah as we've looked at in other parts of the Bible. It's not the same as the court intrigue that we get in Rome when we get to the New Testament or that we get in the court of Herod. This is a truly unique singular moment and it's a global cosmopolitan moment with the whole world for the first time in our journey through the Bible. If you're reading through a chronologically, this is the first time that everybody's there wants from all the corners of planet earth. All of these cultures mingling together and affecting things. I love that historically we get the most politically powerful character we have yet to meet in the Bible on screen a ton and that is the king character in the Book of Esther. I also love how much extra biblical history we've got about this era from very colorful historians. Our sources on this stuff are biased and they tell juicy stories that portray their well-liked characters in the most elaborately beautiful of lights and the characters that the historians despise. Oh my, do they emphasize and maybe even embellish the most unflattering to put it lightly moments of these characters lives. So we get to wade through great ancient literature together. So thing number one that for me is the big sales pitch on why you should do this entire series with me and why we should unwrap the generational gift that is the story of Esther together is that the setting is absolutely incredible. Reason number two, the story is off the charts for the ages. Awesome. All of the adventure and intrigue and love and lost and murder and betrayal and massively high stakes and reversals of fortune and twists and surprises but also satisfying symmetry. It's all there. The story is painstakingly intentionally beautifully crafted in such a way that you're given a gajillion opportunities to read between the lines of the motives of the characters and to speculate about what they're doing here, what they're doing there. The characters are rich and robust, which I suppose is the third reason that I'm super excited about this book and hope that you will do this whole series of conversations with me. The characters are awesome. They're realistic. They're interesting. There's also some hyperbole being involved. I don't think any of that is dishonest on the part of the author. The author assumes that the reader knows exactly what genre of literature this is. And so for example, that author is going to lean hard into the fatal flaw of the king character that being that he's easily persuadable despite his massive power and wildly reactionary given his emotional state. All of these characters are big. And one in particular reason number four that I think you should totally go through this entire conversation and unwrap this present with me is the female lead is stunning. She's fantastic. She's brave, but also terrified of things. She's got flaws and problems. She doesn't just automatically fix everything. She has to overcome things that are in her way. Some of those things are external to her. Some of those things are internal to her, which is the hallmark of a great relatable character. Another selling point I want to throw out about this book is the important role it plays in the larger picture of the Bible. We just got done going through a whole series season two of this podcast was through the whole Bible one book per day until we're done. We just finished that what two days ago and the book of Esther plays a really key role in terms of how all of that unfolds. So I'm excited for that reason as well. Another selling point on this book is that it raises difficult, interesting, provocative, theological questions about how the Bible works, about how God does things, about how God's providence works. How does he do things without looking like he's doing things? Who's really in charge here in this story? And I think one of the fascinating features of the book of Esther is that God isn't mentioned in it. It's the only book in the Bible that works that way. And I'm grateful for the format we've got here where we have time to set it up and think it all through the right way because there is a lot of setup that needs to go into Esther. The events described in that book come on the heels of the most tumultuous century in the history of the Old Testament. It's the sixth century. You get the fall of the Assyrian Empire. You get the end of the country of Judah. You have the Babylonian exile. You have the rise of the Babylonians. You have the fall of the Babylonians. You have the beginning of the Persian Empire. And then once we get a little bit solidified in that Persian Empire, it's then in this brave, new, very different world from most of what we see in the Old Testament that we meet, King Xerxes and that we meet brave Queen Esther. So since we got time to do it the right way, we're going to dive deep to make sure that we are as well positioned as possible to understand Esther's world and to understand what this book is all about. This book is going to be interesting and engaging and exciting and thought-provoking regardless of who you are or what you believe or where you're at in terms of faith or not faith. And one of the things I love about the conversations we get to have here is that we don't all think the same things. We're not all in the same place in terms of the big questions about life, death, God, eternity, faith, all of that kind of stuff. And this is a book that I think flings the gates wide open in invitation to anybody, no matter who you are, to come in, get together with a weird unlikely crew of other people who normally don't have a chance to hang out together on the internet and think about something that for 2,500 years has been regarded as a timeless treasure across cultures and across generations and across languages. It just looked like a book that Fred Savage was unwrapping there in the Princess Bride, but the grandpa understood. This story has implications and it means something generationally. He was excited to pass it along. And likewise, I'm excited to hang out with you and to receive together this timeless story handed down through the ages that is now arrived here at our doorstep in our time on the stage of history. Thank you for doing this with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
