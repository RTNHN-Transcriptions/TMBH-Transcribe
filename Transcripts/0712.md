 Hey, you know, he's one of the biggest turds in history. It's F.E. Altees of Trochis. That guy sold out King Leonidas in the 300 Spartans in 480 BC at the Battle of Thermopylae. That totally happened. He sided against his own Greek people with the invading Persians under Xerxes, and the Spartans set up shop there with some other detachments, Greek hop lights, and they get their shields and their big long spears. And the Persians, I don't know how many millions you got. If you got this tiny little narrow place, you got to walk through and you got a bunch of Spartans there. This is real hard to pass through. And look at me wrong, they Sparta was a weird place. I wouldn't want to be a Spartan. I wouldn't want to live there. I don't agree with probably much of anything they thought about government, but they had their way of doing it. And they were the defenders in this situation, and they could have lasted. This jerk at the altis is like, no, for the right price, I would show you a goat path to get around and to come up behind him and kill him. And the Persians were like, sure. And then F.E. Alti shows him the way. And then the 300 Spartans get defeated. And then after that, Xerxes marches down to Athens, and F.E. Altis is still like, but I get my money right. And Xerxes is like, yeah, just give me a minute. I got to wipe out the Athenians. But he doesn't. The Athenians end up winning and F.E. Altis gets nothing. Alti gets killed by some other dude for an unrelated offense down the road later on. And that's the end of that guy. Nothing. He's a burned asset. He gets just left behind. Kind of the same deal with Judas Iscariot. He shows the religious leaders, Goon Squad, where Jesus is, takes them on the metaphorical goat path to get behind the metaphorical phalanx so that they can arrest Jesus under cover of darkness and get away with their dirty deeds. And then Judas gets his dumb little reward. And he's like, wait, I got problems as a result of this. I don't know about what we did. And you're the spiritual leaders of my community. And you're supposed to be able to give me leadership and shepherding here. And so he comes to them, heartbroken and a mess. And they're like, dude, not our problem. I don't know what you want, but like you get nothing from us. And it's just tragic. He sold out someone who was shepherding his soul in favor of someone who wouldn't lift a finger to shepherd his soul. And the passage where we learn about this goes like this. And Judas, this is Matthew 27, three. When Judas who'd betrayed him saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the 30 silver coins to the chief priests and elders. I've sinned, he said, for I've betrayed innocent blood. What's that to us? They replied, that's your responsibility. So Judas threw the money into the temple and left, then he went away and hanged himself. Now the chief priests pick up the coins and say, oh, it's against the law to put this money into the treasury since it's blood money. So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the field of blood to this day. And then there's some stuff that is about fulfilling Old Testament prophecy that we will look at here in just a little bit. So first of all, as we discussed yesterday, it's just awful. What happened here is insult to injury. Maybe some will look at that and be like, you sold out Jesus, you get what you deserve pal, but the whole Jesus dying on the cross thing is kind of about mercy in Jesus. In general, like, I don't know, kind of root for deliverance wherever you can. In this case, apparently the situation was beyond repair. Judas was so overcome with remorse. He'd cut himself off from someone who was a shepherd of his soul and despair takes over and he hangs himself. But we got a little bit of a problem with this passage that distracts us from the sorrowful nature and the poignancy of that. The problem that we have with it is that it looks like Luke gives us a little different version of events in Acts chapter one in the middle of the passage where the disciples are all huddled together and they pick a replacement for Judas who ends up being Matthias, by the way. So kind of double Matthew in the disciple crowd. I mean, I don't know what your name is, but I'm just saying, I mean, is what it is. Verse 18, Acts one, with the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field. Mary fell headlong, his body burst open and all of the intestines spilled out. Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this. So they called the field in their language, Akaldama, which is field of blood. There are a few things there that don't neatly synthesize with Matthew's account. Matthew's account, the religious leaders by the field in Acts, Judas buys the field. In Matthew, he just hung himself in Acts. He fell headlong and his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. Look, I was a middle school boy once and I don't even really want to pretend that that's ever fully worn off. So yeah, I've thought about that. Maybe even drawn at a time or two super, super sorry for anybody who was looking over my shoulder in class. I had those red markers out and took a stab at imagining this scene in my seventh grade brain, but it's pretty gory. It gets your attention. Then it is sort of tough to square. But wait, wait, before we get into that, there's one more thing that doesn't correspond neatly. So it says this is why it was called the field of blood. It's because it was a burial place for foreigners according to Matthew, but everybody in Jerusalem heard about what Judas did in Acts and according to Luke, that's why it's called the field of blood. So it's another one of those what gives scenarios. And I suppose anytime we run into those, the most natural explanation that many will latch onto is just, well, somebody's wrong. I mean, yeah, it could be another read on this could be where I always take us next, which is it could just be two very different perspectives that what we're getting here is one point of emphasis. And then another Matthew in writing about this is trying to really place the emphasis of the story on Peter's failure contrasted with Judas's failure contrasted yet further with the culpability of the religious leadership in Judas's extended failure. Judas got a bunch of stuff wrong, but like in fairness, he was possessed by Lucifer, Lord of darkness and also had the entire completely condemnable religious leadership who Jesus lambasts back here in Matthew 23 as being a brood of vipers. He also has all of them working against him. So there is that, whereas Peter just shanked it on his own. I think all of these points of contrast are intentional. I also think Matthew is looking for every opportunity to point out the hypocrisy of the religious leaders in the same way that his master Jesus pointed out the hypocrisy of the religious leaders. So here, like this Judas comes to them and it's like shepherd me. I screwed up and they're like, yeah, not our problem. Tough luck. I don't care at all about their actual duty, but then look at how absolutely careful they are not to make any procedural mistakes with what to do with blood money. Like they even know it's blood money. They know what they did. They call it blood money. They know it's dirty and what they did is wrong. They know it so much that they're like, so we couldn't really use it on temple things, guys. I mean, I don't know. We did use that money technically to hire someone to lie and betray and have someone murdered unjustly. It just wouldn't be right to invest that back into temple accoutrements. We should just get a field or something instead that would feel more moral. Why do you care at this point? Are you kidding me? So Matthew is really putting an emphasis on the absurdity of the brokenness of the religious system that Jesus is a foil to. Whereas Luke isn't as concerned with that. Luke is concerned with vindicating Christ. He was innocent. He was the son of God. He did rise from the dead. He did ascend to the right hand of the father. Luke notes his audience, a more non-Jewish audience is going to be like, well, the same impulse that your grandma feels when she sees somebody pulled over and you're like, yeah, well, I don't know for sure that they did anything wrong. But grandma's like, ah, sirens wouldn't be on. I don't pull people over for nothing. There was something that went wrong there. Well, that same sensibility seems to have been present in the Roman world. Like, hey, the Romans don't mess with you unless you're causing problems. So Jesus, there's probably some, some wrong with that guy. Luke wants a full and complete pardon in the minds of his audience. He wants of indication. That's what he's writing for. That's what he's editing for. This Judas thing would seem to be more a matter of historical housekeeping for him. So Judas, like he's just gone. I guess I need to wrap up that story a little bit. He died in a really grizzly way. It looks like Luke is conscious of the fact that everybody had heard this rumor and like Luke felt compelled to make sure that his research answered this outstanding felt question on the part of the audience to whom he was writing. And he also seems to have found some point of connection for the common audience to whom he's writing. Like I got this field. Notice that it says their language, not in your language. So he were writing the Jews, Akodama, and that is the field of blood. Is it possible that both of these things are true across the board then? And we can just dismiss the conflicts as, as being a result of different perspectives and different points of emphasis. Well, yeah, I think they could both be true. If I'm to be honest, this is one of the real Bible doozies. And yes, I can make this tension go away in a way that is mostly satisfying for me. It could be just like totally through the front door with you. This is also one of those places where I'm like, the credibility of the rest of the Bible just causes me to give it the benefit of the doubt on this passage and like one or two other things that rise to this level. This point of controversy has nothing to do with how like salvation works or God works and many of that. It's a historical footnote. So even if one does come to the conclusion that we got a whopsy here on the part of the Bible, at least it doesn't just take apart everything. It's not like, no, Jesus didn't die on the cross. And another book is like, no, he definitely did. So if that represents one end of the spectrum of what to do with this, a mostly harmless, though, stick in your craw troubling contradiction, the other end of the spectrum would be represented thusly. Matthew puts the emphasis on the wickedness of the chief priests. It was Judas's money that they spent. So it could be said that Judas bought it because he earned the money. He performed the human action that created the money. And that's what bought this thing. It's a little bit of tongue in cheek language, but you and I have said things like that before. Like, for example, when you disagree with what you were forced to pay for in taxes, you might look at a stupid thing and be like, well, your tax dollars at work or, huh, I guess I paid for that. Well, in the most literal sense, you didn't write the check and it wasn't in your name. But yeah, you paid for it. Maybe that is the reconciling point that we can look at here. Additionally, there could be more than one way or more than one story behind how people arrived at field of blood. Why something is called the field of blood, which appears to just be a nickname, could have more than one explanation. There was a place called Dead Man's Curve that I remember growing up in Iowa. And I heard two explanations for that. One being that there were some people buried near there and that you could go and look at their gravestones. Another being that it was a hard curve and you might fly off of it and die. Well, I suppose both of those things could be true when you're dealing in a local legend and local nicknames for places and things like that. The third point of conflict is the hanging. You could say, well, one makes it sound like he threw himself off of a rock or something. The other makes it sound like he hung himself, but one could hang themselves by throwing himself off of a rock. That's morbid. Now we're getting into like hanging yourself techniques. Wow, I can think of all kinds of dark like wisest I could have gone for on that one. Glad that wasn't the theme of this episode. But gruesome, though, it may be it is entirely possible because the most people have never tried hanging themselves before to imagine that you'd be really, really bad at it. If you did try for lack of practice and that it might go really wrong or that maybe nobody came and took down his body and that what was initially a hanging turned into something much more grotesque a little bit later. I don't know. I think they're reconcilable. I understand the some of you are going to listen to this and be like, they're not. And that's really, really a problem for me. I also understand that others of you are going to listen to this and be like, they're not reconcilable and I can live with that. But I think the bigger point for what we're doing in Matthew is not this side show. The bigger point is the point of emphasis that Matthew is making about the cruelty of the religious leaders, their collective failure to serve as a shepherd to someone who is requesting, desperately shepherding and how absolutely indifferent they are to the fact that they just fully admittedly commissioned a murder. But boy, we have to make sure that we allocate those funds properly and that we do our proper clerical paperwork because that would be an absolute travesty if we got it wrong. Hypocrisy on the part of the religious leaders and their complicitness in the destruction of Judas, the role they played in that. That is what we're supposed to really catch. But also, I don't know, we try to chase down all of these rabbit trails. So I'm glad we bounced over to acts and had time for that as well. We're going to come back to the Judas thing and look at another one of Matthew's fulfillment of prophecy passages that gets tagged onto the end of this next time around. Alright, I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. We'll do the skin soon.
