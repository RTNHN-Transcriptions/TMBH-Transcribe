 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Leviticus. Hey my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and we have arrived at the metaphorical shipwreck graveyard where all of the well-intentioned Bible in a year reading plans go to die. It's the third book of the Bible. It's Leviticus. And even now there are probably some of you who are like, I remember as traumatic the last time I tried to do nothing made any sense, it's a nightmare. But I, my friends, I'm here to tell you, it is not a nightmare. You just need the 10,000 foot view. This is actually a beautifully organized book that makes mountains of sense. It has a teeny, tiny, simple little narrative through line. And I think we're going to have no trouble sorting this one out before we get going. I just got to say that the stuff that we're about to talk about here in terms of Leviticus, this isn't something I figured out. People have known this since forever, like centuries and millennia. They have seen this structure to it. So you got to any book or any introduction and any study Bible. They're going to point this out as well. But don't feel bad if you didn't get it the last time you tried to slog through Leviticus because these categories that make it make sense, this structure that makes it so beautiful and symmetrical, it is not immediately evident, especially because you're coming off a too rich, thick, creamy narrative books, 90 chapters worth of high drama and fascinating characters and calamitous consequences and generous, gracious God over the course of Genesis and Exodus. But then you get to change up when you get to Leviticus and it starts to read differently. Okay, when you picture Exodus and Leviticus, you got to imagine a Venn diagram where there's a teeny, tiny little sliver of overlap between the end of Exodus and the beginning of Leviticus. We didn't talk about this last time, but right at the end of Exodus, they get the tabernacle, the temporary traveling temple built where the holiness, the presence of God lives in the ark of the covenant. And when they get the thing done, it's all dedicated and set up. God shows up. It says, then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Well, rad. We made a thing. We did what God said. And sure enough, he showed up. That's got to be pretty affirming, right? But then get this, Moses, according to Exodus 40 and verse 35, could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled upon it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. What? Well, how are you supposed to have a relationship with God if you can't go anywhere near God? And if you're Moses, it's going to be hugely disappointing because you got to hang out with God a lot. You can hang out with them at the burning bush. You hang out with God on the mountain, but now is confusing because it felt like this whole covenant thing and the whole story was moving toward God being more in relationship with his people. But now the priest, the mediator, the chief representative, he can't even go in the tent. So what gives? Turn the page. Well, it's a study Bible since a couple of pages over to the beginning of Leviticus. And we see we're in the exact same place. Moses can't go into the tent. Leviticus one one. The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said, speak to the Israelites and say to them, when any of you brings an offering to the Lord, bring as you're offering an animal from either the herd or the flock and right there, the first instruction from God causes knee jerk painful reaction, maybe a little bit of shame from the last time you tried to read through the Bible and Leviticus got you hung up to like, Oh, here we go with all the sacrifices and stuff. I still promise this is all going to make sense. But back to the plot. We got a problem. Nobody can go into this tent now. There's distance between God and the people. And so the billion dollar question of the book of Leviticus is, well, how can we be closer to God? How can we live in communion and community with God? And maybe the natural way to conceive of what's going on here, relationally is that God is like he's hurt and he's angry and he's a little bit grumpy about things. And he wanted to be wanted and liked more and they just don't like him enough. But that's an anthropomorphism. That's not what God is doing here. What we discover as the book of Leviticus unfolds in is we get a little more detail about how God is is a God is holy. He's powerful. He's not like us. He's different. Think of something that's enormously powerful. It's also beautiful and that you respect and kind of want to be around, but maybe it wouldn't be the best idea without maximum preparation. For example, a Siberian tiger, those things are majestic and beautiful and amazing. You can't just walk up to a Siberian tiger, like jump a fence in the zoo and just go stroll around in there and assume that's going to work out. I mean, you see some people who do all kinds of work to prepare themselves to be able to be around something that powerful, but there's a lot that goes into that. And even then the power is so overwhelming that you better be real, real careful. Well, the metaphor falls short here because it's a Siberian tiger comes nowhere near to encapsulating the magnificent holiness and power of God, the unbearable, even glory of God. And that is what is putting the obstacle between Moses and being able to go into the tent. And so Leviticus is just about how are we going to solve this problem. And this is the part where I told you it divides up really neatly into three matching sections on the front end and on the back end of the book with a middle pivot point. This is a very common structure in Hebrew literature called chiasm. So again, just to work track on with each other, picture seven sections in this book, the first and the seventh sections deal with the same material, those being the rituals that will play out in the life and annual rhythm of the people in communion with God segments two and six of the book of Leviticus deal with the mediators, a special class that God was appointing to specialize in preparing themselves to be in the presence of the tiger, to be in the presence of this enormous power. And there's a lot that goes into that. So it gets a lot of discussion. Sections three and five deal with purity. And when we get to that section, we're going to talk a lot about what purity means in this regard, because it might not be exactly what you're picturing. And then there's a middle section that seems to summarize the whole principle of the entire book and it kind of offers a catch all solution for anything we might have forgotten. Okay, the ritual stuff sections one and section seven. Here we get all the business that you've probably heard of about a sacrificial system. Like we talked about at the end of Exodus, we got this lingering question, like how do you fix it when you screw things up with your relationship with God? Uh huh. Well, Leviticus deals with this. The first section is on the sacrificial system and what each individual should do depending on what they got wrong or what time a year that we're talking about. Section seven on ritual stuff deals with the calendar year and all of these different festivals that happen that all have a story from what God has already done attached to them. And with both of these, there's a certain way that everything is supposed to be carried out and quite a significant degree of specificity. And that's where a lot of readers get bogged down in Leviticus. So sections one and seven that deals with the ritual stuff, sacrifices and festivals. Sections two and six once again deal with the mediators, the priests, the people who go between. And the first part has a little bit more narrative to it. That includes the story of some flippant priests who didn't really take seriously their responsibility. They went too close to the tiger and they did not prepare themselves properly and they died. Then that little narrative thread kind of goes into suspended animation and gets picked up again in sections six, where we learn more about how these priests are supposed to be and what they need to do to get themselves ready to go into the presence of the metaphorical tiger so that they can properly serve as a go between between the people and God, which is obviously a very important role. Then in sections three and five, we get a whole new concept introduced here, but it's a very important one for understanding the rest of the Old Testament and for understanding the significance of Jesus and the stuff that he does and the moves that he makes. And this is about the categories clean and unclean. Don't confuse this necessarily with naughty and nice. There's all kinds of stuff according to Leviticus that a person might do in the natural course of living and dying and going to the bathroom and being a human who has fluids and things that happen periodically that for whatever reason in the mind of God makes you unprepared or unclean, unready to go into his presence. Again, it's not a guilt thing. There are processes or time limits where in this uncleanness expires. It's a preparation thing. It's a right state of mind, right state of presentation thing that this clean and unclean stuff deals with. Now, some of the business that relates to clean and unclean here in section three and section five happens to overlap with moral stuff. How you treat other people, what you do with your relationships, including the most intimate aspects of relationships. But it also includes things that aren't really naughty or nice. Once again, like just what food you eat. And this is where we start to get the idea of what now modern Jews refer to as kosher. It's clean and unclean. Now, maybe you're thinking that is a lot of stuff to keep track of. You get six rhyming segments that deal with these great big concepts all the way from the national holiday festival level all the way down to digi something you weren't supposed to eat. Or did you come into contact with a fluid associated with the giving of life, in which case, in my case, I'm not clean to how many days is that it's a lot to take in. And the middle section block four just serves as this catch all for everything. You got this grandest of all festivals. It's a day of atonement. There's a sacrifice that happens there that covers everything that you might have screwed up or got wrong. You meant to get it right. And it didn't work out. And this catch all is very important in setting up the idea of Jesus as the fulfillment of the sacrificial system more on that as we go along. But then there's a second sacrifice where you don't actually end up killing the animal. You send it out into the desert after going through a religious ritual by which you put all of the guilt of the nation onto that animal and then send it off. That's the scapegoat. And that guilt just runs off with that goat into the wilderness, both pointing toward God's enormous forgiveness as far as the east is from the west. It's just gone. But also pointing to again, the concept of guilt being shifted from those who actually own it and bear the weight of it to someone else who could take the place of the guilty in absorbing that punishment. And obviously that again points to Jesus. The very last thing that we get in the book of Leviticus is Moses just reiterating what the terms of the covenant are. God's going to be our God. We're going to be his people. It's a conditional covenant though. So like take this stuff in Leviticus. Seriously, if we obey him, all the nations are going to know that he's the one true God because he's going to bless us. And if we disobey him, all the nations will still know that he's the one true God because he's going to punish us. That leaves us with just one question about Leviticus. We got a plot thread that's still hanging out there. Moses couldn't go into the presence of God. We have a question. How do you get near the tiger? How do you get near this power? Well, what we just covered was God's answer. Here's what it looks like to live in community with God in this context of the Old Testament. It's complex. It's a lot. But if we go and look closely and we start peeling back the layers, we see that it all provides for right living in this community, in this moment in history, that it points to the character of God and that it sets things up for the big payoff in the redemptive plan, which again is going to be Jesus. But I keep teasing this. We get the narrative thread. Did it work? Can Moses now go into the presence of God? And what we discover after all of this is that now Moses is able to go into the tent. So in summary, when you visualize Leviticus, picture obviously the law. When you think about the theme of Leviticus, reflect on how God makes it possible to approach his holiness. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you hit Leviticus 1711. That kind of gives you the fast gist of a lot of what's going on in the book and make sure to catch the last verse of the book itself. Yeah, look at us. That's another level up. This time on the book of Leviticus, I'm excited about how this is going next time around. We're going to be in numbers. Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
