 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And as you can tell, because of how you have yours, I don't feel very good. Actually, I feel really good. My voice is just a wreck right now. So I'm going to edit out all the parts where I make weird mouth and sinus noises. I'm going to keep all the parts where I just say words that might be constructive for moving forward our conversation, which has been about the book of Matthew. And we're just getting into Matthew 24. Matthew 24 has a lot to do with the temple. And so we've been talking about what the temple would have meant to the original audience, what it would have meant as a building, a sheer magnificent edifice, and what it would have meant in terms of religious and national and spiritual and thematic legacy for them. Because this is a multifaceted story that unfolds over the years is not one of just pure victory and glory. It's got a lot of different elements to it. And that's what we're talking about today. So there was a show that came out six, seven years ago, maybe it was made in Canada had Eugene Levy in it. His son was in it too. Catherine O'Hara was in it. And maybe part of the reason that it resonated with me is because it feels a little bit like an extension of that Christopher Guest comedy troupe stuff. Christopher Guest was the six-fingered man and the Princess Bride. And this is part of the spinal tap and waiting for Guffman and best in show and oh my goodness, I'm forgetting the funniest one, whatever, you get what I'm talking about or you don't, which would also be fine. And it's a funny little sitcom about this family who had a crap ton of money and really lost touch with how blessed they were to live the lives that they were living in the big city. And then things all fall apart and they go completely broke. And the only holding they have left is like a motel or maybe they own the whole town of this little dump town in the middle of nowhere. And so they move into a couple of motel rooms and they have to start from close to nothing and every little victory that they achieve comes with a bunch of laughs and hijinks and that's kind of how the show works, especially the first couple seasons, which I enjoyed the most. But one of the really interesting themes and character dynamics of the show is that as it goes along, the characters appreciation of their little achievements are all bittersweet because yeah, this is a good thing that we got done. Like we got a job application filled out or we got enough money to pay for some more food, but they can't help but think of it with this bitter memory of how much better it was and how much easier it was before. Likewise, as we look at the story of the temple in the Old Testament, we get really two chapters of this thing. Chapter one is the building and destruction of the first temple. This story ranges from the mid 10th century BC under the United monarchy under the leadership of Solomon and that story wraps up around 586, 587, depending on who you talk to with Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonians destruction of that grand and glorious temple. Now in that period, as we looked at yesterday, there is this dedication that we're going to talk more about today that is beautiful and lavish and massive and expensive and God shows up. Inarguably visible, everybody sees the spirit of God show up and do miraculous things and it sounds like it's this amazing faith-confirming direction confirming moment. And in my little analogy that I'm using here, that would be the chapter that corresponds with living the high life in the big city and having tons of resources and everything is working and it's easy. But in the second chapter, things completely fall apart. The Israelite people go effectively, completely broke. They get defeated in two phases and hauled away into captivity and at the very back end of living memory, some 50, 60-ish years, I haven't done the math up top of my head, but something like that, they are allowed to come back and rebuild the temple from the ruins of Jerusalem. And as they start to rebuild this temple, they're not living the high life anymore. Yeah, it's a victory, but it's a little modest victory and it's a victory that happens within living memory of how incredible the last thing was. And so again, much like this sitcom I'm talking about, this victory that is the second temple just can't help but be contrasted with the glory of the first temple. And yesterday we covered quite a bit about the glory of the dedication of that first temple in first King chapter eight under Solomon. But what we didn't really have time to look at was just how lavish this was. You are talking 14, maybe 15 days depending on how you count it, of celebration and feasting. There's all kinds of sacrifices being made to God and some of those sacrifices are like that's all for you God, the whole thing, but the way some of the other sacrifices work, like you give God the part of it, like the fat part and then you eat the rest of the stuff. So people were living large. It doesn't sound like it was licentious or bad. It seems like their heads and their hearts were in the right place. And this was a pretty cool thing, but check this out. They sacrificed according to first King chapter eight verse 63, 22,000 cattle. I've never even owned one cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. Never had any of those either. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple to the Lord. The first king's eight is only half of the account that we get in the Old Testament of the dedication of that first temple because it's also covered in second Chronicles five, which I marked so I could get over there, faster than usual. And the first chunk of chapter five reads almost exactly like first King's eight. So there's no point in me really hitting that again. So then toward the end of chapter five of second Chronicles, it says the trumpeters and singers joined in unison as with one voice to give praise and thanks to the Lord, accompanied by trumpet symbols and other instruments. They raised their voices and praise to the Lord and saying he is good is love endures forever. And that's Psalm 136. So presumably they just planned to sing Psalm 136. Maybe they handed out sheets so everybody could see that in ransom photocopies. Everybody got the words right. And it was really cool. And then while they're all singing that the coolest event ever during a church singing time happens. And that is that God tangibly physically shows up. And the temple of the Lord was filled with a cloud and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord filled the temple of God. And then after that, we get Solomon's big long speech that has a bunch of the material from first Kings that we already glance at a reference and it's awesome and you should read it. His speech fills all of chapter six fast forward to the beginning of chapter seven. And it says when Solomon finished praying fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. And then it says again, the priest couldn't enter perform their services that way anymore because the presence of the Lord was there in that way. And as crazy as this sounds, everybody was probably expecting this because way back in Leviticus chapter nine when the tabernacle, which was a temporary portable temple was set up, this is what happened. The Moses and his family when they did the sacrifices and stuff and fire came down and the presence of the Lord showed up in that place. And so now you're making something permanent. You'd expect that you're just transferring the role the tabernacle plays to this permanent place. I mean, if God's going to live there, you'd expect a continuation of that and you get it. So two times people have anticipated that God is going to dwell among them in this place in this way. And there's some sort of supernatural confirmation. Okay. All the way back to the thing we were talking about at the beginning with having these memories of these grand things contrasted with memories of less grand things. This amazing temple that was dedicated with all of this money and unity and singing and miraculous stuff gets torn down 400ish years later by the neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, most famous of them all. He lays siege to Jerusalem and the end of second chronicles, which in my Bible is only like, can you hear it? That many pages later, it ain't far in terms of percentage of Bible between this grand dedication and everything looking great to total collapse. And that's what we get in second chronicles 36 as Nebuchadnezzar shows up, lays siege to Jerusalem under the weak rulership of the young kings at Akiah. You know what? I was going to try to cover all of this today, but it's such a good story. And we really need to have it right in order to move forward properly with the rest of Matthew. So nope, I'm not going to read that to you right now. I'm going to read that to you tomorrow as we continue to flesh out this remarkable analogy that I've crafted for you about a Canadian sitcom whose name I'm not going to say on this program because someone's going to mistake it for swear and be offended. But it's all going to make sense as we go along. So we're just about done talking about chapter one of the story of the temple in the Old Testament, which is glorious and amazing. And then ends really sad. And then as we get done with that, we'll get into the less resplendent chapter two as the Israelites take a second shot at a temple later on. Zawg. Going to be totally worth it. Thank you for enduring my voice and thank you for hanging out with me. Also thank you for leaving reviews. That has been a really, really helpful thing. Any kind of app where you leave a review affects the way that particular podcast app rates this program. So hey, here's a big ask. If you really like what's happening here, it would be super helpful if you would review it and even maybe more than one place. Apparently, when you leave reviews on any and every given app, that app is more likely to put this podcast in front of people, which I think is great. So thank you to everybody who's taking the time to review the program anywhere. You're awesome. I've read a bunch of those. It really, really means a lot. Seriously, that encouragement goes a long ways. Okay. More temple stuff tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
