 a here's a life tip for you if you want to get a good sense who somebody is where they're at how they think about the world just walk up to them randomly if you've never met in any social context like on the street at the grocery store at the opera just interrupt whatever's going on the cake excuse me permit in nineteen ninety four who performed the chart topping hit ice where and i tell you one of two things some people without raising any questions or concerns about the social context in which you broached the question are just gonna look you right in the eye and be like there was all for one and everybody knows that but you can just turn to the very next person be like same question to you brother what's the answer and with just as much conviction and confidence they're gonna look at you and be like ice where that was by john michael mcgumery i remember that summer and then if you really want to mess with them be like okay same question who did i can love you like that and they're gonna give you the same answers and the freaky part is everybody's right because back then the world was so split into little segments that you could have the exact same song on different genre charts at the exact same time and apparently there's no cross pollination and no concern with that whatsoever but my point is that ice where song do you remember it like i swear but sun in the moon in the stars or something like that i'm getting exactly right the whole idea is it's like this person professing their love and be there with you forever it's a nice the eighties ninety style song and the profession is that i am swearing by all of these incredibly valuable things and i remember listening to that was a kid and thinking that's beautiful that's the kind of thing that i would like to communicate to somebody that i'm in love with to really get the point across that i'm gonna be there for them forever and i thought about it a little bit further and i was like that's incredibly hollow any of that mean i don't own the sun i don't own the moon i don't own the stars those are completely vacuous words and those vows mean absolutely nothing and further i broke up with every girlfriend i ever had in my entire life all of them except for chamilla she and i were doing great we're super in love and happy and that that's going awesome but i broke up with all the other ones and i said all kinds of things like i really care about you baby and probably even channeled some of these complete stupid top forty lyrics at them in an attempt to get them to like me more because i was an idiot not like now obviously smart and good at things and sophisticated socially i mean back then when i was super dumb but in addition to the fact that i do think of that as an all for one song the telling detail here for me is that at any point in my life i listened to those types of lyrics and was like oh yeah that's how you know somebody means it because they're like i swear but then along the way is i'm sure is in the case for most or all of you you realize that people say i swear a lot about a lot of things and that doesn't really matter very much there's always an out clause there's always some kind of wiggle room there's always the option to just the outright lie or gas lighting and saying i don't think i ever swore by the sun and the moon and the stars and likewise in Matthew chapter 23 we find that this phenomenon of bloated swear language that doesn't really mean much of anything this is not a new phenomenon it was an issue that had been an issue for apparently some decent amount of time by the time gesla shows up because there were social expectations there were rules there were laws i mean heck even the old testament speaks to this thing and gesla brings up sloppy oath keeping and sloppy invocations of the phrase i swear and weasily little i swear addendums that are just right there in the footnotes and the fine print that people were apparently attaching to their grand ovations of oath taking and vow taking and gesla's is pointing to all of these things every time they come up is evidence the problems with people's hearts and problems with the way we think about truth and interact with each other and that topic is back in view in woe number three of seven woes that we're looking at Matthew chapter 23 that gesla's fires off at the religious leadership in front of everybody this one's going to be fun it's going to take a while to break down so we'll see how far we get today Matthew 23 16 woe do you blind guides now that's interesting right off the bat because this is the only one of the seven woes where gesla's does not address the woe to the Pharisees and the teachers of the law i think he says the other way around teachers of the law and the Pharisees i think maybe we glossed over this a little bit on the front end of talking about the seven woes but i mean you're smart you've seen movies you've read books you can tell that what we're getting here is something that reads like an oracle like somebody who stands up and speaks dangerous truth in bold dangerous situations is kind of like buttercups nightmare that she kept having where that lady would stand up and everybody else like oh this is so beautiful and they're golf clapping and everything and Christopher Saranden's up there on the balcony like princess butter cup and then robin right she comes out and she's all lovely and everything but she's conflicted but the theme of the story is true love and so there's the old lady who comes out and she's got the warts and the screwed up face and she yells boo boo boo and all of the booing it's story structure wise archetype wise that's the truth telling oracle that's the bold dangerous statement of actual truth in front of everybody that maybe everybody actually knows but nobody really has the courage to say and she comes out and says it so that's the kind of thing that we're getting here and in any type of genre where this character shows up be it Shakespeare be it classical greek tragedies be it in modern filmmaking be it in the bible there's always this really neat tidy structure to how you say it and if there's ever any kind of deviation from that well that would be worth interpreting more deeply because apparently that deviation from the formula is intentional and is making a point so boo to you whoa to you that sounds just like all the other stuff the blind guides departure from the structure here then means that somehow this failure to keep oaths that we're going to see in the upcoming verses makes them blind guides this is how you people who are hearing these statements of woes should be able to figure out that these are not truth tellers and that they deserve this ironic title of blind guide i mean who do you really want guiding you around through dangerous things i mean maybe if it's like daredevil or something who has heightened senses after being exposed to toxic chemicals it's one thing but there's no such indication here the Pharisees did not apparently have heightened senses smell and hearing and they were not able to do the things daredevil can do so they really are just blind guides because they don't do the integrity thing they say lots of words they make lots of boasts but these boasts and these words don't mean anything you say picking it up in verse 16 again if anyone swears by the temple it means nothing but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple then he's bound by his oath there's so many things especially in the narrative parts of the new testament where it's very tempting to just buzz by it because it seems culturally foreign to us but i don't think it's that hard in this situation to piece back together what was going on here even if we don't have original source material on exactly how the structures of all of the oaths worked and we actually do have some original source material on it still it's pretty easy to see that this is an accusation of weaseling the religious leadership was apparently telling people that a certain kind of oath wasn't entirely binding but another kind of oath means you totally mean it if you're like didn't we talk about this before the answer is yes we did talk about that back in Matthew chapter five and we'll go and look at that in our next conversation but just even from the immediate context it would appear that what's going on here is a charge of gerrymandering the rules of oaths to accommodate things that Pharisees had said so that they come off looking good and so that everybody else comes off looking bad remember all of that business from the beginning of chapter 23 about how the Pharisees tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them remember that additional business that came right after that about how much the Pharisees like the place of honor and they like the titles well one of the places where that was apparently manifesting was in how Pharisees taught on and themselves practiced certain types of oath proclaiming and oath keeping and my guess would be that at some point the Pharisees made some sort of religious political proclamation about hey like this is how the things are and then that tweet did not age well and people came back and they were like ah you said that this is how the things had to be and you swore an oath that this is what we'd all have to do in that particular situation you swore an oath by the temple remember but then it didn't really benefit you to keep that oath anymore and then you were like well you don't actually it's not you don't swear by the temple it's by like the gold in the temple which we did not technically say and therefore what we were doing like it was a test it was we were making a point about the oaths and how bad and corrupt our enemies are and also think about those people over there like they don't keep oaths very well either do they you should focus on that I mean it just looks like all of the political bull crappery that we get today where you use stupid language that'll only work on the dumbest people in society or your own base who so badly wants to believe that you're right no matter what anyway it smacks of the kind of stuff where you use weasel words and weasel language to make sure that you are never even kind of a little bit wrong about anything in front of anyone because your enemies will pounce and they will pounce because well if they did it you would pounce on them seizing any opportunity to get ahead and cement your own power and authority and what goes through the ringer in that kind of environment as you are experiencing in your culture right now is any notion of actual truth any sense of how things actually are any sense of can you believe the things that that person says is that an accurate account of the thing and so while we're just at the front end of getting into this thought that Jesus is introducing to me it is already reading like an indictment of the entire dialogue the entire thing that the religious leadership had built probably in a quiet partnership with their political enemies and in doing so they create this overton window that always preserves their power where only certain things can be discussed debated talked about and where truth will always be framed in a certain slippery way and that benefits people in power so they're going to set up rules that are real real slick and difficult to interpret and difficult to keep track of and those things can always be amended and changed and maneuvered around by the masses betters to make the things the way they need things to be it looks pretty clearly like the accusation here is that those are the kind of untruthy shenanigans that these leaders these blind guides were pulling and I think what we're going to find is we go along is that hey once you start doing that and playing those kind of games you really forfeit your ability to be a guide to anyone yet these folks were very very proud at their ability to be a guide and well we're just at the tip of the iceberg of Jesus condemnation of this behavior on their part and we will break that down more completely in the coming conversations a mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon
