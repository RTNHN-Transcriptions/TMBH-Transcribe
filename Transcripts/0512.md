 What's up, my friends? It's Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Have you seen this motif in movies and stories everywhere? It's the one where you got two people who are old friends and they were on the same side of a thing, but there was some resentment or darkness brewing underneath in one of the two and the same temptation was common to both of them, but one sort of fails the test and gives into the darkness and the other pushes past that test and stays on the side of what is right. Then as the story unfolds, eventually these two parties, these old friends or maybe even brothers or sisters are back together. Maybe the good guy infiltrates the stronghold of the bad guy to try to talk sense or make one final plea with the person who is given into the darkness. The idea of such a scene is that the good guy is trying to exhaust every last option, every available plea or a bit of reasoning that they possibly can because they still care about this person. I can think of examples of this all the way back to thousands of years ago. This is sort of how I read the relationship between Julius Caesar and Pompeii. Pompeii finally lost and had his head taken on the shores of Alexandria and Julius Caesar, who had been at war with him, found out about this. He was not a happy man. He wanted the chance to go in further try to talk sense to see if he could patch the thing up. The desperation plea motif, I guess, is what happens on planet Mustafar. I think that's the name of the volcano planet, right? In episode three of Star Wars, we get the really clumsy dialogue between Hayden Christensen and Obi-Wan Kenobi, you and McGregor, where he's trying to plead with the guy who's given into the darkness one last time. Come on, think about this. There's the end of Dr. Strange for crying out loud. We got one person who's going to take the dark path and the one who's taking the light path tries to plead with them to do the right thing. You have got a picture or another one. Oh, Charles and Magneto in the X-Men universe. They're always firing back and forth with Charles trying to redeem Eric so that he'll come back around to something that is saner and better. And I just read a children's story that has this same motif where there's this relationship that is developed between a bad guy and a good girl and the good girl on the eve of everything going nuclear makes one last plea. Like it's not too late. You could still turn this thing around and choose a different course of action. And for a moment, it almost looks as though there's a softening and the one party is going to say, you're right. Get me out of this. Help me. But instead you get that Isfield Durer at the edge of the volcano looking back at Elrond and being like, yeah, I'm not going to destroy the ring. And the darkness finally wins and takes over. I feel like that's what we're getting in Matthew chapter 22. Jesus is not here for blood. He is not the conquering Messiah that's here to clean house. He's not here for a reckoning. He's here to serve, to give his life as a ransom for many. He's here to point people back to this truest, realist thing. I mean, remember what was the very first message that Jesus gave? It was a repetition of John the Baptist's message, repent, turn in another direction for the kingdom of heaven is near. And so when we get into Matthew 21, 22 and on forward, it can feel like, and this is the big showdown and maybe I'm guilty of overly presenting it that way. But I think from Jesus perspective, even though it might look like a showdown to us as outside observers, he's sort of Julius Caesaring it a little bit here. He's making this plea with his people. And really he's going even to the leaders of his people, those who have tremendous sway over the masses. And he's trying to point out to them that they are missing the point. Now he does so with pretty direct language oftentimes, but I think Jesus gives a rip about these people. And I think that there's something encouraging that happens at the end of 22 where it looks like for a moment, there is a softening. Maybe we're going to throw that ring into the volcano. Maybe we are going to make our eyebrows go up in the middle and say, I'm sorry, I'm just insecure and I got threatened about everything. I got my head screwed on wrong and everything went sideways. And then it just compounded. And now I feel like I've made so many mistakes that I've backed myself into a corner in front of everyone. I can't picture a way out of this, but I want out of this so badly. Please show me the way out of this thing. Help me. I think it's okay to be a little bit swept up in the controversy and the head to head conflict that we're seeing here between the religious leaders and Jesus. But I also don't think we're being entirely fair to the text if we disregard this undercurrent of Jesus genuinely trying to make this thing make sense. So we got these tests. They're all abrasive. All of these would be grounds for Jesus to permanently block everybody who initiated these obnoxious, not in good faith arguments that they come to him with, trying to shame him in front of everybody, shooting for gotcha moments. But after really soundly defeating them in the first two of those, then Glenn, the name we're using for the fancy Pharisee, the big heavy who comes up, he asks a reasonable question. Jesus gives him a brilliant theological Bible answer. And by all accounts, the dude is like, yeah, okay, that was pretty good. That made sense. And Jesus even affirms him. There's the eyebrows up in the middle moment. There's the softening. There's the tears. There's the come on Ben solo. Listen to reason. Come back around. You're not too far gone. And I think at the end of chapter two, what we've got here is the final little glimmer of light glimmer of hope. Maybe this could be resolved moment that comes and goes very quickly. It goes like this verse 41 and forward. Well, the Pharisees were gathered together. Jesus asked them, what do you think about the Christ? Who son is he? The son of David, they replied. He said to them, how is it then that David speaking by the spirit calls him Lord for he says, the Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. If then David calls him Lord, how can he be his son? No one could say a word in reply. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions. Next time around, we're going to break down what that first blush to you and me probably feels like an impenetrable argument that Jesus is making there. And there is a little bit inside baseball and Bible stuff there and we will break that down more carefully. But you see what he's doing. Jesus got asked three questions. Hey, should we be paying taxes? Oh, where is this lady going to be married to married? All these guys and they all died. What's the greatest commandment? He comes back and he asks them three questions and these questions are of good faith. These are not gotcha questions. He's not being aggressive. He is reasoning with them. He is pleading with them. Question number one, what do you think about the Christ? Question number two, whose son is he? There's no gotcha there. There's nothing biting about that at all. And then question number three, if then David calls him Lord, how can he be his son? Those are all reasonable questions about the identity of the Messiah. What is this whole friction about? What's the fight? What's the tension? Why are we headed toward violence here? Why is everybody so mad? The identity of the Messiah. Everybody can read the writing on the wall and see that everything Jesus is doing looks really Messiah-ish. People are saying that he's the Messiah. The kids are yelling Messiah-ish stuff about him being the son of David. And everybody's really excited about that except for these religious leaders who Jesus is here pleading with and making this argument before. He's speaking their language. He's using their methodology, their framework for thinking about stuff. He is bending over backwards to accommodate them to try to plead with them to hear this. Come on guys, you've been doing this for a long time. You've thought about this for a long time. The answer to the question is in the words that you teach and recite all the time. Who is the Christ supposed to be? Whose son is he? How does that connect with David? Come on, you guys read the Bible? You memorized the whole thing. Think about this part. You quote it all the time. Connect the dots. And I don't think he was messing around. I don't think this was something that he did that he felt like, oh, well, you know, I have to make it look like I really honestly tried. Sometimes that's why we go and have that last conversation is because we want to make it look like we really honestly tried. Maybe deep down, we're hoping that they don't even come around. I hope not. I hope that when you and I are in the position of go and try to talk somebody out of something destructive that we're doing that out of goodwill and because we really mean it. I don't know. I don't know if I've always got that right or not, but still that's the ideal. And I think Jesus means this. He's not just checking a box a little bit later on in Acts. We see Paul follow Jesus example and go and do this in a very sincere way. All of Paul's buddies are like, dude, you are not popular in Jerusalem. The same people who killed Jesus. They're still there. They're still in charge. They don't like you and they want to kill you too. So don't go back there. Just hang out in all of these churches that you've planted where everybody loves you. You can be an Ephesus or Corinth or Rome. Most of the time in Rome, you're going to be cool. I guess eventually that didn't work out for Paul. But instead, Paul is like, no, I'm going back to Jerusalem because I am going to go have this conversation at the edge of Mount Doom. I'm going to go try and talk sense to my old classmates, my own friends. Think about it strategically. Guys, Paul is saying if we could get this right, if we could get that crowd to see it, it's right there. Their eyes are just shut. Maybe they'll listen if we plead with them. Maybe they'll listen to me because we went to school together. And so a prophet guy comes up to Paul. And he's like, dude, I'm telling you, he takes his belt and he wraps it around Paul's, I think, wrists. And he's like, hey, this is what they're going to do to you if you go. He predicts this. And you'll recall Paul famously is like, yeah, well, I'm going to do it anyway. It's a very ester. If I perish, I perish kind of approach. And he goes back to Jerusalem and he gets a little ways into his speech, but it does not go well. And the same people who hear Jesus is pleading with don't respond well to Paul's attempt to plead with them either. And I think there's a sadness to this last verse in chapter 22. No one could say a word in reply. And from that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions. You and I are going to look at that. And again, probably just because of the way I've framed it up, we're going to be like, yeah, triumph. Ha ha. You win. They lose. And I really do like that element. And I think we're supposed to see that element here, but also there's a tragedy to that. A better verse 46 that didn't happen, but would have been cool if it did happen would be like, and then the Pharisees eyebrows went up in the middle even further because it was their sensitive, soft hearted eyebrows. And they remembered who they were. Then the spell wore off and they could see clearly once again and the scales fell off of their eyes and they repented and they apologized to Jesus for the evil they had held in their heart toward them. And they realized, truly you are the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of God. And we will make this abundantly clear to all of our people and the entire trajectory of history will be changed because praise God, the Messiah is here and the kingdom is in our midst. Let's just do this thing right now. Thank you for persisting with us. Now we get it. Now we see it. How can we move forward together? And they said all of these things with knees bent before their king, but that's not what you get. Instead, you get, well, they didn't kill him right then. But yep, they realized they were wrong. They couldn't say a word in reply, but their eyebrows still went down in the middle and they continued on the path they were going to go on anyway. You flip the page. I think literally, yep, for me, it is one page. Oh, Jerusalem Jerusalem. You who kill the prophets and stone those who sent you how often I've longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers or chicks under her wings, but you weren't willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate for I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. This wasn't an act. He loves these people. This is a genuine plea that he is making that he is initiating going to them after the way they've treated him. He still walks into their circle and follows up with these questions born out of goodwill that are meant for their benefit. And even though they realize that he's right and he's making sense, they're still like in a budge. They're too far gone. And the last little ray of sun goes behind the hills and the eyebrows go down in the middle and the die is cast. We'll look at the Old Testament stuff. Jesus is referencing next time around and break down his argument. A mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
