 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. You ever see one of those movie scenes where somebody needs a crucial bit of information from somebody else before they die? It's usually like an informant or somebody who's under duress. And they're like, we got to find him. We got to find out what the deal is. And he runs up to the guy and they're like, tell me about the thing. Tell me about Project Thing-a-thing. And then the sniper assassin hit man who's there to eliminate the source, puts a bullet in him, right as they're about to say the thing. And then the protagonist is like, Harry, you still got to tell me about the thing. And then the dying person is like, you have to talk to the plot go longer. It's like if you could have just led with the name instead of telling me what to do, that would have worked out great. So this kind of scenes work because we understand there's a certain urgency when somebody's about to die because of how final death generally is. And that's the kind of sequence that we're dealing with here in Matthew chapter 19 and moving forward is the disciples have finally come around to accepting that Jesus actually means it. He keeps saying like, I'm going to die. And they're like, no, probably not. Or we'll use swords and stop it and we'll protect you, Jesus. But he's like, no, you're not going to. I'm totally going to die. That's going to happen. So gradually, the behavior of the disciples is shifting as we get through chapters 18 and 19 and we get all kinds of context clues that they're getting it that they understand. And some of those context clues involve maturity on the part of the disciples. Others of those context clues indicate a completely understandable fear from people who still don't totally get everything about who they're dealing with and are feeling really uncertain about what their future is going to look like if their leader is not around. And I think because of that, their minds are going to, how are we going to be set up when you're gone? Who's going to be in charge? What are we going to get? Like, you just told that kid who came up to you and tried to become a new disciple to go get rid of all of his stuff. Well, you know what? Jesus stuff provides a little bit of insurance against the difficulties of this world. And it'd be kind of nice to have that around if you're going to go ahead and die. So I guess Peter raised his hand and this is the sound of my hand being raised. I got it. I got a question. Jesus. Yes, Peter. So like, what are we supposed to do implicitly when you're gone, if we don't have any stuff and we don't have you, like what's going to be left for us? I guess why Peter's being a little bit pushy here is because he feels a sense of urgency. Like the protagonist who's hovering over the body of the person who's dying and they're like, okay, your death is obviously imminent. I just really need these details before you go. And so Peter's pressing the issue. And being like, you vultures circling my soon to be carcass, seeing who can get what out of this thing grows, guys. Jesus is instead empathetic and patient. And he chooses to go about answering Peter's reasonably urgent question, not quite the way Peter would have imagined. And that very complex, very important response to Peter's question is what you and I, my friends, are going to be looking at all week here. Jesus tears into this theme that he's touched on a whole bunch in the past. We've looked at that the last few episodes and it's going to come up a ton over the next chapter and change. And that is this theme of reversal, this theme of humility, this theme of if you want to be first, you got to be last, this theme of the upside downness of the values of his kingdom. And Jesus does so with a very patient tone. I would understand if Jesus wanted to get a little bit chippy here and be like, how many times do I have to tell you guys about how the things are, I've already explained it like 10 times and you saw miracles quipping idiots, but he gets it. It's hard. The only reality these guys know is the physical reality they've only ever lived in the cave. Jesus has been outside the cave. He knows what's in the cave is an illusion. It's not real reality. Jesus knows there's a bigger reality, but he also knows that once your eyes have adjusted to the cave, it's kind of hard to picture the things outside the cave paraphrases Plato's. So he gives this patient response that spans the end of chapter 19 in the beginning of chapter 20, where at the end of 19, he says, but many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first cut to chapter 20. Weird that there's a chapter break there. I don't know. I wasn't in charge of that. That's the manmade thing that happened after the fact that this one I think is placed in a dumb place. We've already been over that. Whatever. The very next thing he says is a familiar phrase, something that should tip off all of the attentive readers and the disciples at this point that, ah, we're doing a parable. We're doing a story that has familiar setting and some familiar characters and mostly familiar plot beats, but that is going to have some kind of twist that points toward the values of the kingdom and how the kingdom of heaven is. So the phrase that everybody would catch would be for the kingdom of heaven is like, and he's used his phrase a whole bunch, chapter 13, almost every parable there in the kingdom parables discourse starts with this phrase. It's like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. So right off the bat, the kingdom of heaven in this is like the landowner. So we've got to put a pin in that because a lot of these parables is really easy to read them and get to the end and be like, ah, like this is what popped to me. And this is what it made me feel. Ben Folds is one of my favorite musicians. And when I listened to Ben Folds writing, I always feel like, mm. Yep. The two fingers pointing at my eyes, two fingers pointing at your eyes, Ben Folds. We understand each other. We're like the same dude. Just one of us has a ton more talent and it's not me. And Ben Folds, you just wrote a song that connects deeply with my soul. And I know exactly what you meant. And then you listen to Ben Folds talk about it. And he's like, yeah, some people took it this way. I'm like, yeah, idiots. Some people took it this way morons. Some people took it this way. I'm like, wait, that's how I took it. Is there another? Some people took it. And some people took it this other way. Wait a minute. Are you going to say that none of those are right? And any of those could be it because even though my writing definitely means something, I still want people to be able to see themselves and do with it what they need to. The big time paraphrase is mine there, but that was just. And so what I discovered is that as an interpreter of Ben Folds lyrics and storytelling, I had fixated on one or two themes that as he went on to talk about what he was thinking when he wrote the song, I realized, oh, I picked up and latched on to the wrong theme as the cipher for that song when the author of the song was weaving this theme. And it's evident now that I would better understand what he was saying if I had fixated on the same thing, he was fixated on, but I just missed it. So I say that just as an interpretive pause here because I find that when I really butcher the Bible and look back on stuff, I was like, ah, I was trying to get it right, but I'm not sure it actually means that. And of course that hasn't happened at all during the course of this podcast because it's all carefully researched and 100% accurate. But when I do get stuff wrong, it seems that I inflict my own assumptions onto the text or I fixate on one little phrase, it just triggers something for him. I'm like, oh, yeah, that's totally how the things are. And so the nice thing about these kingdom parables where they are a little more ambiguous, some of them don't even get explained. And it could be easy to miss what's going on. What's nice about these is that almost all of them start with the cipher for the kingdom of heaven is like, oh, what's it like? It's like a landowner who went out in the early morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. Okay, so it's like the landowner and what the landowner did. All right, that's in the back of my brain. Let's go on with the story. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. All right. So I'm not saying a hundred bucks because I want people to be oppressed or underpaid to work in underappreciated jobs. I just like base 10 and it's easy to put my brain. So we're just going to say a hundred bucks. All right, two versus them. What have we learned so far? The landowner has a project going on and he is recruiting people to participate in the project. And there's some urgency to the project. He wants to get the project done. And to do that, he's choosing to include other people rather than go out and do all of the stuff himself. Is he fit to go do it himself or not? I don't know. The parable doesn't speak to that. He's just choosing to bring people on and denarius is the definitionally a day's wage at this point in history. So we know that the landowner is just and reasonable and to a degree he's trusting because he's bringing day laborers into his property and his space and giving them access to his project. Even though they're pretty untested and they were just standing around in the marketplace. And I would think for Matthew's original audience, maybe for the disciples who were standing there. And even maybe for any of you who this is your first time through the book of Matthew. At this point, we've seen enough of Jesus to know how this thing is shaping up. There's going to be a twist and this story is going to flow out of the question that precipitated the story. So somehow this person who was first is going to end up being last. But that's interesting because at least so far there's nothing wrong with this person. This person was standing around in the marketplace putting themselves out there making it clear they were available to work today and the landowner season and the strikes a deal with them and everybody's doing exactly what they ought to be doing. It doesn't make sense that somebody who got up early and was ready to work and struck a deal would need to be punished by being last when everything settles out. So there is a question that lingers for us as to what trajectory this story is precisely going to take. And tomorrow we are going to explore that. I have an unusual thank you that I want to offer today. And that is to the people over the last few months who have tapped out on supporting the program on Patreon. I got a bunch of creators I support on the internet through their various Patreon pages. And I was thumbing through that the other day and I came across one of those. I was like, oh yeah, I just kind of did that to help that guy get off the ground and I haven't really checked in on him in a long time. It seems great and everything. But I kind of like to redirect my support to something else for a while, something that I've discovered more recently. And then I felt all weird about it. I was like, well, should I send him a text or an email or what do I do? I don't want him to feel bad, but I have my little Patreon budget and I think I might like to redirect it for a little while. And then it occurred to me, I bet it's felt weird for some of you who were like, oh, I might want to do something different here. Did this for a while and that was cool and I appreciate it, but now I'd like to make a change, but I don't want Matt to feel bad. Wow, let me just say this. Hey, all of you who have had to tap out or just got onto something else and didn't want to support the channel anymore, it's the internet and that is totally cool. And the fact that you jumped in, even for whatever amount of time you did, holy cow, that is so encouraging. And at any point that you need to make a change, and I'm sorry, I haven't said this sooner, you go for it without any hard feelings. So thank you to everybody who supports right now, everybody who supported at any point, everybody who is never going to support the program at any point. You totally don't have to. It is not weird. I am so glad that you're all here. It is a joy and a privilege to get to do this together. And I do not take that for granted, especially after a week of feeling too sick to do it well myself. Thanks for being here with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
