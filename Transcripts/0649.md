 Hello, my friends, this is Matt. It's the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and Judas is scary. It is fascinating, isn't he? Because he went and did something murderous and horrible. It's kind of weird, isn't it? How intriguing that kind of dark behavior is? Well, I have had a lot of fun over the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what he's going for, looking at all these different angles in the text, thinking about economic factors, psychological factors, character factors. Now we're thinking about a couple other angles, as we talk about it more today and land the plane on the conversation. So my friend Jeff, who makes music for this podcast and edits so dutifully, a wonderfully talented man, is now going to select some music and play it, and then we're going to get back into the flow of the conversation. Matthew is content to let Judas be the betrayer and to fully own his decisions and everything that went into that, at least at the most overt level. We're going to talk more about how Judas is a fulfillment of some Old Testament storylines that are left flapping in the wind, and we'll get to that later on. Luke, who is very interested in demonstrating that there was a grand cosmic conspiracy against Jesus in the spiritual realm, as well as in the hearts of wicked men and government and that Jesus was right and from God and that he is vindicated. Luke really wants to spell it out for us and make it very, very clear that no, it wasn't even just human evil that propagated this lie about Jesus guilt before the government and the dishonorable death that he suffered. It was a satanic lie directed and orchestrated by Satan as well, whereas John takes a much more long term heavenly spiritual view of everything and it fits thematically very neatly into the way he tells his story and the editorial choices he makes to demonstrate that there is this much bigger than flesh and blood battle going on that is playing out in the events surrounding the cross. So everybody's motivations make sense for why they include the detail or omit the detail. For Matthew, who has been developing a theme of betrayal, dereliction of duty on those placed in this position of influence and what it looks like to be a faithful servant versus a failed servant, then all that other stuff that Jesus was just talking about in the Olivet Discourse for him, it makes a lot of sense that then we would get another example of what that looks like even in close proximity to Jesus. And that is of course, Judas Iscariot. But what a phrase, right? Let's step back from all of the academic stuff and understanding that many of you who are a part of this conversation are coming at this from a perspective of theism. You think there is a spiritual world and you think that there is a God and that there's also forces of spiritual evil that are at work and do things, characterize it as Satan. There are others of you here who are like, I don't know, I think the story is really interesting. I think it's fascinating the way people perceived this, but you don't believe that there's any kind of spiritual reality or maybe you don't believe that this kind of spiritual reality that's being characterized in the Bible is the right take on how all of it works. Regardless of where you're coming from, it is quite the skin crawling moment when you get to that point that I just read from in Luke and it says Satan entered him. Are you kidding me? We're not talking about a whole bunch of little devils that harass pigs anymore. We're not talking about some little low ranking spirit that comes and makes it so it's harder for somebody to talk or any of the things that we've seen cast out. We're not talking about some little thing that even the disciples when they were sent out might have occasionally been able to cast out a demon here or there like that stuff's all super intimidating. That's a pretty freaky concept. If there's such a thing as demons, I dang, that's scary. I get it. I understand why all sorts of art and fiction have been fascinated with these evil agents who operate in opposition to God. But we're not talking about that here. We're talking about Satan, Lucifer, Lord of darkness, master of evil who would not let this particular task be delegated to anyone else. You want something done right. You got to do it yourself. And so reading the accounts over in Luke and John help you better appreciate the stakes. Now Matthew is framed the stakes differently and the stakes are maximum and Matthew's account as well. He's just talking to a different audience and he's getting them to this point in a different way. But what a scary route to understanding the stakes that John and Luke take us through to get there. Maximum evil power on display to carry out this maximum evil event. And as tons of people have noted, it all backfires. And this Satan character feels that he is going to go and bring about the ruin of the redemptive plan of God. He sees this rightly as being the culminating event, the pivot moment. This is your chance to go and win. And well, it ends up that it isn't just Judas who ends up committing suicide at the end of all of this. This mistake in calculation, if indeed we can attribute it to a mistake, I think attributing the mistakes and missteps strategically of Satan and how he played all of this to the sovereignty and power of God. It makes more sense than shocking it up to the bumbling of Satan alone. But however you want to look at it, this is supposed to be his master stroke to defeat the kingdom and the king. And it ends up not just being something that results in the suicide of his host, Judas. But really effectively, this is the self-inflicted wound that seals the deal for the failure of Satan's plan to thwart the redemptive plan of God. He meant to kill Judas and kill God, but he ended up killing himself. And now I feel like I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit here and spoiling things that we're still going to get to and unpack more slowly and give due time to. But I tell you what, Matthew 26 rolls along and we get Judas on screen being Judas-like. Dang, we just got to pay attention to that. He's a captivating character behaving in a way that just seems so erratic and snap and nuts. And maybe we can cook up some kind of human rationale for it. But the light that Luke and John's accounts shed on this attributing Judas's action to the spiritual forces of darkness on the grandest scale. That just makes the whole thing scarier, brings the narrative more into focus, and also makes Christ's predicted victory over death, all the more impressive and all the more glorious. Thank you for going down the Judas, the scariest rabbit hole with me on this one, which took us into currency reform, currency weight, modern silver value, ancient real estate, receipts, and a whole lot of psychoanalysis across the centuries by yours truly, who's not really trained to do any kind of quality psychoanalysis. I had fun. I hope you have as well. We'll keep moving forward on the narrative of Matthew 26 next time around. A mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
