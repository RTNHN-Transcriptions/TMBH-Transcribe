<<<<<<< HEAD
 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 1 John. The book of 1 John was written by John, and there's a couple people who have that name in early Christian history, but the early church fathers, including people who knew him and knew people who knew him, say that this is John the beloved disciple, John the son of Zebedee, John who wrote the gospel of John, John who also wrote 2nd and 3rd, John, John who wrote Revelation, and John who was the one disciple who didn't die of violent martyr's death, but who instead, according to tradition, goes to the area around Ephesus and sets up shop there and lives out his life doing Christian ministry and writing stuff. So we think it's that John, we got good reasons for thinking it's that John, what we can definitely, definitely even more so say for sure is that 1st, 2nd, and 3rd John are all written by the same guy. It's in the exact same voice, and it's dealing with the exact same problem. What is that problem? Well, I'm so very glad you asked. It looks like the deal is this. A bunch of false teachers, I know it's always the false teachers, they're always showing up and they're always causing problems. Well, that's the deal here again. A bunch of false teachers showed up, and these are teachers whose particular issue started with the divinity of Christ. So they rolled into presumably Ephesus, if this is written by John, it would make sense. That would be the church you would have the most relationship with. So they roll into, let's say, Ephesus, and they start spouting off about Jesus is not the Christ. He is not the promised king. The descendant of David who was to come and reign on the throne forever. He's not the son of God, and they're reverting to some weird hybrid, I guess, of Greek dualistic philosophy, like light and darkness. They're just two sides of the same coin. You can't really have one without the other. This is a classic Greek moral philosophy and understanding of the forces that brought balance to the world. And so they're trying to take that old Greek philosophy and hybridize it with some old Jewish assumptions. And the result is no Christianity at all. The result is a mutant Frankenstein, weird, gross, ugly, twisted up religion that doesn't make any sense or have any foundation at all. So John decides that he is going to write into this problem, not to the false teachers, but to the people who were thrown into confusion by it. Now, this is where you're going to notice a little flavor of difference between what we've seen from Peter and Paul and what we get from John. Paul, from time to time, admittedly, would definitely get mad and he would go really hard at people. Remember backing Galatians when he was talking about the Judaizers who came in and we're like, you all should get circumcised. And Paul's like, oh, yeah, smart guys, we'll have cutting off a little bit of that flesh would help a little bit. Why not go the whole way and cut off the whole thing for even more goodness with God? Paul was chippy and feisty at times. And indeed, in the last book we looked at, we see Peter echoing the aggressive denunciation of the Pharisees that Jesus fired off in Matthew chapter 23. Peter could get pretty hot as well in his writing, but John, well, maybe he just had the benefit of living to a very old age. Maybe he was just wired a little differently. He takes a very different tone, a very gentle, grand fatherly tone with the whole thing. It almost reads to me like he is trying to come off as mildly tottering and a little bit old and like he needs to go over the same point in cycle two or three times with these young folks to remind them of how the things are. There's a gentle, warm, stabilizing tone that I detect in John in this, do we call it a letter? And people generally say it's a letter, but it doesn't read quite like the rest of the letters read. Still, I think it was meant to be distributed and handed around amongst these churches. Maybe letter is the best term for it. Right at the beginning, we see language that is very reminiscent of the gospel of John, which is very reminiscent of the very beginning of the Bible in the book of Genesis. This connects the whole Bible together from beginning to end in a very, I think, overt way. Some might say it's subtle, but all of this is in the beginning God. In other words, this whole redemptive plan from all of the story of the Old Testament through the work of Christ recorded in the gospel of John and on the cross and all the way through the age of the early church. And even as these false teachers come to cause problems, all of that is happening under the purview of God. He is not panicked. He is carrying out his redemptive plan. And then John goes on to say, you know, this light and dark thing, this philosophy that lingers around the edges of your culture and your church and that these false teachers are trying to integrate with the things of Christ. Yeah, it doesn't work. Light and dark, they're not two sides of the same coin. They're not their opposite. They're intention. They're in conflict. And the right understanding of light and dark is that light is desirable and good and dark is not. You want to walk in the light. You want to be Christians, not who have a foot in each world, but who are squarely planted in the light of Christ. John gives us a bit of a thesis starting in verse five. He says, this is the message we've heard from him and declare to you God is light in him. There's no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and don't live by the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he's in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus, his son purifies us from all sin. It looks like the people John's writing to were thrown into such confusion that they weren't even sure if they were Christians or not, because what the false teachers are saying is so different than what they believed and what they'd heard from John and Peter and Paul and even second hand from Jesus. So they're wondering like, who's who's right? Who's the actual Christian here? And what John is saying is, well, I'm going to give you a test. I'm going to give you a way to know if you are walking in the light, if you are indeed a Christian. And what he ends up laying out over the course of this book is a threefold test for whether or not you are indeed a Christian. If these three things exist in your life, probably you are. If these next three things, I'm going to say don't there might be a problem here. It's obedience and love or put another way, right belief, right action and right relationships should be present in the life of the Christian. And rather than giving us a vigorously linear Paul style argument, what we get instead is more of a cyclical argument where John advances this idea of the threefold test, truth, obedience and love. Those are the marks of being a Christian. He spells out the idea that God is light and God is love. And this is truth. It's kind of following a Trinitarian model in that regard. And so he patiently and grandfatherly circles around these three ideas, taking his dear children as he calls them his audience by the hand and walking them through reflection on each of these questions for themselves. And also reflection on each of these questions for the false teachers. Do they say things that are true? Do they live in obedience to the teachings of Christ? Do they love other people? And the conclusion that is evident by the time John is done is that no, these false teachers don't pass the threefold test for being in Christ for walking in the light. But you, dear children, make sure that you do. There's a very important note of clarification that needs to happen here. John is not laying out a threefold path to earning salvation in Christ. If you say things that are true and think things that are true, if you do things that are right and if you love people, then God will receive you into his kingdom. No, no, no, no, what John is providing is a threefold test of whether you are already in Christ that is very much in keeping with the stuff that James, the brother of Jesus wrote back in his letter and that Paul wrote back in his letter to the Galatians about the fruit of the spirit. There are things that should manifest if you are in Christ and John is simplifying that down to three things that somebody who's in turmoil could look at to say, well, am I actually a Christian or not? And further is that other person over there who's saying stuff that sounds weird? Are they actually a Christian or not? When you visualize the book of first John picture light and dark in contrast. When you think about the theme, reflect on how walking in the light produces truth, obedience and love. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing and hopefully you do, this is a very powerful book. But if you don't, check out chapter one versus five through ten. This wasn't the only thing that John wrote regarding this particular predicament. We're going to look at the second thing he wrote regarding this situation next time around in second John. I'm Matt.
