 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. You've been to a wedding, right? Maybe one or two or a lot, or maybe you had one of those that you were actually in because you got married in it. It's a very odd cultural experience because it's one of the few places in life where all kinds of points of cultural and religious, traditional folklore connections to our distant past are still in place. We might not even know what they all mean, but there's little things that you do at a wedding that you don't do at a wedding, things that are faux pas, things that are funny, things that are very important to honor in terms of tradition. If an alien came from outer space to explore our culture and they learned everything about it except weddings, then one day you're like, all right, Roger, now we're going to tell you about weddings. They would be very confused because it's going to be like, I thought I had this on lockdown. I thought I understood how you people were, but this is a lot of weird stuff that you do here. It would take a lot of explaining to make it all make sense as to what it means and how it theoretically sets the couple up for success. If you do this, it honors that parent. This is why the groom side does this. This is why the bride side does that. I think hard enough about it. There's a reason for all of it. I suppose you can lay that out for somebody or in this case, a hypothetical alien. Well, we're kind of the hypothetical alien when we look back at the traditions of weddings in previous cultures, from previous eras and other parts of the world. So anytime a wedding comes up in the Bible, we are tourists in a strange foreign land and there are going to be a bunch of little references to things that are not going to make any sense to us without a little bit of research and careful thought. For example, at the beginning of Matthew chapter 25, which is the chapter that we're in now, look what we did. We got 24 on that. We're on to it. This is high five. This is exciting. See, we're making progress. At the beginning of Matthew chapter 25, which is still, I mean, it's still the same speech. We're still in the same conversation as all of Matthew 24. We got a chapter break there. We'll talk later on about whether or not that chapter break makes any sense being where it is. But at the beginning of chapter 25, we get a story where all of the meaning from this parable, this illustration that Jesus uses, it's all dependent on being able to picture what's going on with the wedding ceremony and what this tradition is and what the proper thing to do in this moment. The dance steps of a wedding would be and what the buffoon thing to do in this moment of a wedding would be. And so I'm going to read this to you, but in the same way that, hey, wedding traditions are a little bit tricky even to understand now, just like cut yourself some slack here. Take it easy on ourselves and each other. Okay. If everything's going on here doesn't immediately make sense. We're going to figure it out and figure out what this passage is all about a little bit. Matthew 25 one, Jesus is talking, the kingdom of heaven will be like 10 bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. None of them were foolish and five were wise. The five who were foolish didn't take enough olive oil for their lamps, but the other five were wise enough to take along extra oil. When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight, they were roused by the shout, look, the bridegroom is coming. Come out and meet him. All the bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps. Then the five foolish ones asked the others, please give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out, but the others replied, we don't have enough for all of us. Go to a shop and buy some for yourselves, but while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom came. Then those who were ready went with them into the marriage feast and the door was locked. Later, when the other five bridesmaids returned, they stood outside calling Lord, Lord, open the door for us, but he called back, believe me, I don't know you. So you too must keep watch for you don't know the day or the hour of my return. If you've been with me doing this podcast thing for a long time for the book, Matthew, you know the dance steps. You know what I'm going to say next. What I'm going to say next is, wow, there's a lot to unpack there. I understand there's a lot to unpack there and we're going to work through all of it. But let's just start with the story and the cultural elements today so we can catch up with the original audience and stand on the same footing and have the same assumptions and read all of this culturally the same way. All right. So the kingdom of heaven, it's going to be like 10 bridesmaids. I think we're talking about bridesmaids the way you would think of bridesmaids now. Only other modern translations render that word for bridesmaids as virgins. This if I remember right, I could have looked this up and I could have written it down, but this is a Parthianos, right? That's the word for virgin here. Parthianos always confuses me because it sounds like Parthonax is the dragon that you have the moral dilemma over killing or not in Skyrim. Don't kill him. He's a nice guy. But in this context, that Parthianos, I hope I'm using that right, is not a reference to the experience or lack thereof with physical intimacy. It's just talking about there being youthful women of marrying age who are not married. Now, obviously nowadays bridesmaid doesn't mean you're married or not married or never married or divorced or anything like that. It fits your friend culturally. We've just got to a place where that lady stands up on stage with you. Historically, bridesmaids pretty typically were young women or women of marrying age who were not yet married and given Matthew and Jesus' choice of the original Greek verbiage here, that is who the original audience would have imagined would be a bridesmaid in that example. So now we know who we're picturing, a younger lady of marrying age. At this point in the wedding, they would have done a bunch of stuff to help out, to get the outfit ready and to be there and to enjoy and to savor the day and all of those kind of things. But then we get into confusing stuff when we get into like lamps. What are lamps? What are we doing here? Well, according to Omega Genius, who taught classes in college, I went to, who was also one of the directors of my advisee group and who I guess is kind of an authority on these sorts of things. These weddings in the first century were very mobile. They didn't just happen quickly. They didn't happen in one place. This is a multi-day event. And in the phase that we're looking at here, the bride and the bridegroom had assembled at the bride's home. The bridegroom would go to her house. The bridesmaids would be there and the ceremony would occur on the official vows and all of that business. And as soon as that is done, then the bridesmaids, now we're getting on into the evening, even the darkness, they're going to wait outside and let everything get settled up and that could mean a variety of different things inside as the official wedding ceremony is finishing. And at this point, in the whole unfolding of the wedding, the bridesmaids job were to lead a procession across town through the darkness with these little lit oil lamps that they would all have. These lamps are the light from the lamps served as something for a boundary marker to say, if you got the right outfit on and you got one of these lamps here, you were a part of the official wedding party and the official processional. These things always went way into the night. So it was going to be real dark by the time they went across town to the groom's house, where the next stage of the party and celebration would happen. And oftentimes this would go on for several days. Well, then this scenario brings into focus a few practical considerations that will differentiate between the wise and competent bridesmaids and the less than competent bridesmaids because you got to factor a few things in here like, okay, in this particular wedding, how far is it from the brides house to the groom's house that will now become the new married house? How long a walk is it? If it's a very short walk, you're probably not going to need very much oil. But if it's a really long walk, I guess you're going to need a lot of that. And further, these bridesmaids whose job it is to wait outside is getting dark and into the night as long as it takes. I suppose they've got a run a little calculation here like, what's the pacing of this wedding? Are we moving along pretty quick? Are we going to be out here just chatting it up with our little lamps burning all night? Like way, way into like the midnight oil kind of territory. What are we looking at here? Another consideration they would have to make is just how dark is it really? How hard do you have to burn those lamps? How hard do you have to burn those lamps? If you got a full moon and it's a little bit earlier in the evening and the whole city is still kind of lit up, maybe you don't have to burn them as hard. I don't know. I've never been a bridesmaid who did this particular thing, but it's not that hard from the outside looking in to be like, well, you might have to bring some backup oil. I mean, you go out in an ATV ride out in the wilds of the Wind River Mountains in Wyoming. You know pretty much how uphill it's going to be, how crazy things might get, what the water or the wildlife or the weather might do to affect you. And you just got to decide like, this is like a one tank trip or this is kind of thing where we probably ought to throw a gas can on the back because this is the kind of thing where you need to have some reserved fuel. Well, likewise here. You got to do the math on this. And as the story goes along, we find out that some of these bridesmaids are like, this is a wedding. This might take a minute if you bend to these things. It's very sentimental. It's very emotional. Sometimes it just runs late, late, late into the night. I'm going to bring an extra flask of oil. I'm going to be ready to go. So like I'm prepared for anything. I can do this all night if I have to, but then some of the other ones were like, I don't know. It'll probably all go to plan whatever else. I'll just mooch some off of somebody else like I always did on camp trips with other people's toothpaste, except this time it doesn't work out because it's a very long time before the wedding party is announced. And the poor planning bridesmaids are starting to shake their little oil. Like they're like, dang, I don't got very much left in there. Like I can, I can trim and prepare this wick. I can burn a little bit lower, but I don't know. I'm going to run out of oil. Hey, ladies, kind of borrow some of yours and they're like, no, because then we might not have any. And then everybody will run out of oil and then we won't be able to see where we're going and we'll like bring disgrace and shame on the whole thing. It's like bad omen. No paraphrases mine, but because in an environment where things would have been festive and crazy and there would have been all kinds of people in town and in this jovial and spendy mood that would go along with such a thing, shop owners in the area would have been open as long as people were out and doing stuff and make money when you have the opportunity to make money. So the idea then is that the five foolish bridesmaids would be sent off to find some shop that's open after normal hours because of the festivities that are going on to get some oil and they need to hurry back to make sure they could join the processional. And it would be a great big giant embarrassment if they missed the processional, the kind of thing that would hurt the bride's feelings. Like, come on. During this part of the wedding, you have one job. Come on. And the final cultural detail here would be that when you get to the new house where the new married couple is going to be and where you're going to have a celebration. It's like one in the morning. You're going to want to lock things up. And it's not like your house where it's just a front door with the door locked. Like, this is like a dumbus. This is like a Eastern European style, multi-generational household kind of thing with servants and security. And so you need to think less like, oh, can you just open the screen door? I think the little latch is locked. And more like once the airplane door is closed, you are not getting on or off of the plane. Sorry. Like, that's the dividing line. And so if anybody got there after the whole processional had already made their way, I suppose it wouldn't be completely absurd for the master of the house to be like, no, once it's shut, it's shut if they wanted to be here, they would have been here. What can I say? Weddings are weird now. Weddings are weird back then. If you want to understand a story that somebody's telling you about their wedding from whenever they were getting married or whatever age they were, you would need to understand their wedding customs in order to understand whatever funny story they were going to tell you or in this case, you would need to understand these wedding customs in order to understand the important spiritual meaning that Jesus is trying to communicate and we will get into that next time around. And Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
