 What's up, my friends? It's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. I don't know how many episodes it's been, maybe like 300 episodes ago. We talked about tennis. And I was talking about sometimes in tennis, you have to find yourself in a defensive position. Like somebody comes at you, they get a good ball to hit and maybe they hit a really nasty serve. Then you have to play a little bit of deflective defensive tennis to get things back under control. Now you get a ball that you can do something with and now you step into the play and now you're the one on offense. And I think I was talking about that as describing tatatat between Jesus and the religious leaders, several, several chapters back. Well, what I want you to do in your brain is first not accuse me of intellectual laziness. And two, just go back and remember that exact analogy and then just bring it back up to right now. And I say likewise, that rhythm of first having to deflect back the best shot your opponent has and then flipping to aggressive offense is exactly the rhythm that we're getting in Matthew chapter 21. After we spent the last couple of days looking at the religious leaders coming out at Jesus on day two of his time in Jerusalem and trying to catch him in a trap where he's going to give any answer and be accused of being blasphemous. But Jesus flips it around. They ask him, Hey, where do you get this authority to do this stuff? And Jesus is like, well, I'll answer you. You answered me this question. Where did John get the authority to do it? John's baptism. Where'd that come from? Is it from heaven or was it from men and they circle up and they can't answer the question and they say, well, we don't know. And Jesus says, okay, well, neither will I tell you by what authority I'm doing these things. That would be a really fun place to cut off the conversation because it's oh, so satisfying. It's like, ah, Jesus handled your best. But now Jesus goes on offense. Verse 28, he continues, what do you think? There's a man who had two sons and he went to the first one and said, son, go and work today in the vineyard. I will not. He answered, but later he changed his mind and he went. Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. He answered, I will, sir, but he didn't go. Which of the two did what his father wanted? The first they answered Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you for John came to you to show you the way of righteousness and you didn't believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you didn't repent and believe him. This is a pretty straightforward rhetorical move, a pretty straightforward parable, right? You got this land owner. He's got two sons. We see structures similar to this in other teachings of Jesus. I mean, the most obvious one that pops to mind is the prodigal son, which probably has some of the same themes from over in Luke 15. But here you got two sons and very simply the father says something that in this culture would be an entirely reasonable expectation. Hey, like this is your thing. Everything I own is yours and it'll be fully yours eventually. So from time to time, I've got some expectations like you invest in the thing that is yours as my sons and my heirs. So go work in the vineyard. And then the one is like, no, I'm not going to do it. But then he thinks about it. And maybe he goes off and engages in some rough living for part of the morning and burns through some money and does some stupid stuff. And then he's like, yeah, that's right. Sorry guys, I got a bounce. I got to work in the vineyard today. I feel bad. I should have said yes in the first place. And he goes and he works in the vineyard. Sure, he missed the first part of the first shift, but he's there now and he's getting after it. And then the other kid who just wants the immediate payoff of saying the right answer is like, oh yeah, yeah, for sure. I'll get right on that. I definitely get it. Yeah, you bet. You can count on me. And so the father is like, well, that base is covered. Awesome. That was easy. And he goes away and then the kid completely fails to deliver. Which one in some, just as a side note here, by the way, would you rather have? Which one is more damaging to have the one blow you off and then cover stuff that you didn't think was covered? Is that going to wreck the thing that you're building more than the person who says, I have these things covered and then they just don't do it. I think the second is the more damaging of the two options because you thought you had a thing covered. And the first one, anything good that happens is just butter because you thought you were getting nothing. You thought those bases were entirely uncovered. And at the very worst, you're just ending up with the redundancy. And now it's super, super covered because you got somebody else to go and cover those bases as well. Well, more specifically, Jesus asks the question, which of the two do you think did with the father wanted? And come on at this point, how can you go with any answer other than the one that of those two options, like the kid who went and actually did the work? Be a slee, the ideal would be, say, you'll go do the work, let your yes, be yes, and your no, be no, and then you go and you do the work. That'd be great. But that wasn't an option that was presented here. And so I can just hear the exasperation and begrudgingness on the lips of the religious leaders. Yeah, yeah, we get it. Yep. There you go. It's the first one we see whenever we went over parts of the Bible like this when I was a kid in Sunday school, the religious leaders were always presented as complete nitwits who had no idea where this story was going. And then Jesus was like surprise fools gotcha. You walked right into that trap with your doe eyed unwitting trusting response. The first, well, Jesus, golly, that's a great story. Well, I guess of the two, we'd have to say the first. This is really fun. I don't think that's what happened at all. I think they're grippy and they're frustrated and they know that they just walked into a snare that a second ago they thought they had set for him. And Jesus is like, yeah, Roger that. You know, those horrible people that you guys specifically, let me see you, Carl, Randy, Trevor, you were there. Doug, I remember you were there specifically. You were particularly mad. You guys remember up on the Sea of Galilee when I invited that tax collector to follow me. He's actually here. You guys remember Matthew? Say hi, Matthew. Just say hi. It's fine. Cool. I just wanted all those hookers and then we all hung out there together and all of the prostitutes and the tax dudes, they were all super sad and repentant about what they'd been doing. And they're like, man, we didn't do what God wanted for a real long time, but now we're going to quit exploiting people and engaging in practices that are damaging and life is going to look different. And yeah, we might not be able to say it with perfect words in our outfits might not be that impressive. And this might be a little bit socially clumsy. But we are in. We are moved by what you said. We are moved by what John the Baptist did and the groundwork that he laid. And now we hear at this party and you remember that, Doug? You remember how you were that night? You remember you got super mad and grumbly and upset. And then I had to read your thoughts and come over and confront you. And remember how you got even matter as you were trying to save face over the whole thing. And then you griped about me. And do you remember how later you accused me of being like in league with the devil because people who were screwed up got better? Come on, Doug. What's the point of the religion? What's the point of the whole exercise? If you're not perfect from the word go, you're just out. It doesn't redemption fit anywhere. And they're all of this is implicit in the fact that Jesus goes right to the tax collectors and the prostitutes thing. But now he's not just saying, Oh, they're in two. He's saying they're in ahead of you guys. They're going to enter the kingdom of God ahead of you because John came to show you the way of righteousness and you didn't believe him. But these people, the tax collectors and the prostitutes who you could barely stomach being in the same room with and just couldn't wait to find a reason to complain about. They did believe John. And even after you saw this, even after you saw that response from them, I still couldn't soften your heart. You didn't repent. You didn't believe them. Obviously there's some paraphrasing in there and all of that's mine. You can go and read the text and sort out what's what for yourself as you go along. But all of this points me right back to a passage that we keep looking at that prior to this run through Matthew, I just would have no idea it was such an important cipher passage, such an important watershed passage for the whole book. I think I might have said that when we were going through like this is really important. But I might have been making things up a little bit because I definitely did not get it to the degree that I'm getting it now. It's Matthew chapter 11. It's this thing where all of the events that led up to this moment that were John the Baptist driven, all of that is going to get a cap on it here in chapter 11 when John the Baptist sends some representatives. I think he's already arrested at this point and John's representatives go to Jesus and they're like, are you the one or should we be expecting somebody else? And remember so important Jesus replies to them citing Isaiah chapter 35. His answer is really simple. Go back to John and just tell them what you see guys. I think the blind received sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured. The deaf here, the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor. Like what he's saying is remember all the stuff that are the conditions of the Messiah and the identifying marks of the work of the Messiah. Well, all those things are happening and they never happened before. So you guys need me to spell out for you. You feel like you got this one. It's not hard to draw the obvious parallel there between that passage in Matthew 11 and what we're looking at in chapter 21 because it's John the Baptist. It's his testimony. It's people making sense of John and Jesus and all of that. But on a more subtle level, look what Jesus is doing. He's like, these other people could see it. These less desirable, less impressive people, they saw it. They got it. They heard what John was saying. They could see that the blind could see and the lame could walk and the dead were raised to life. They got it. Well, that counterfactual, that hypothetical from later in Matthew chapter 11 when Jesus is saying, woe to all of you people who are callous and not seeing this for what it is. Now that rings a lot more true. Doesn't it? Remember this part from Matthew 11? Wode you, Corzine, Wode you, Beths Theta. If the miracles that were performed and you had been performed entire inside on, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it'll be more bearable for Tyron side on on the day of judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you'll go back down to the depths of the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom. It would have remained to this day. But I tell you, it'll be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. And then we flip back over here to chapter 21. And the counterfactual is now much closer to the factual. It's no longer if this, then that it's here's how it is. It's no longer if these people saw what you'd seen, they would have done this. It's now now here's exactly how the things are. These people, the tax collectors, the prostitutes, the least desirable people I can even think of an aim for. They listened to John. They saw who I was. They did the mental math. They got it. They repented. But you guys couldn't be troubled to do any of that. It's no longer a counterfactual. Those undesirables are miles ahead of you quote unquote, desirables. Look, the people who said they were going to work and do what the master said, but didn't, that's you guys, the religious leaders. You talk a good game. You didn't actually do anything or get it. And the people who screwed it up initially, but then eventually came around and got it right. Those would be undesirables who are now ahead of you in terms of their connection with the kingdom and their entrance into the kingdom. I mean, these times when we get to just whoop up on the religious leaders, they're kind of cathartic and kind of fun. I want to continue to say if I was there, I probably would have been on their team because I don't get a lot of things. And so I want to communicate empathy and patience, but also I want to faithfully communicate what seems to be obviously going on in the text. Even if that means by doing so, I'm condemning myself because I know, dang, well, if I'd been there in the first place, I probably would have been on the side of the religious leaders and not the side of the stuff that was right. More tomorrow on Matt is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
