 The unforgivable sin verse were there. This is the verse in the Bible that was always brought up when I was in Christian high school. I would talk with people of certain other theological persuasions and they'd be like, hey, effectively, if you doubt or question or skeptical of anything we say is from the spirit, you are blaspheming the Holy Spirit and that is the unforgivable sin because in Matthew 12 or something it says something like that. And I was terrified of that. That was a very effective argument against me because who wants to be against God? Do you want to argue with the Holy Spirit? I mean, I'm pro God. I would like to be on his side with things. And early on in my YouTubing, I did a series called Matt Whitman Ruins Treasured Versus of the Bible. And I thought about doing this one, but I think I was still so gun shy from being lambasted over it as a high school kid that I elected not to. Maybe I need to go back and do it now. context. Here's where we're at. We're in Matthew chapter 12. We've had two Sabbath controversies. The tension has been ratcheted up. Jesus withdraws because the Pharisees are plotting to murder him. And as he goes out into more remote places, people follow him. He's still healing people. And Jesus actions here as well as his attitude, his orientation toward those who are weary and burdened, harried and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd, the crowds, his attitude toward them is described by Matthew as being in fulfillment of the first of the four servant songs from Isaiah, songs that predict the life and the works and the role of the Messiah. And after Matthew makes that connection between Isaiah 42 and the actions and approach of Jesus, then we run into a situation in Matthew 12 that looks a lot like a situation we saw back in Matthew 9, which is where Jesus comes upon a demon possessed person who is blind and mute. In Matthew 9, they're back-to-back miracles. One is for some blind guys. One is for a demon possessed mute guy. But if you kind of mush those together, it looks a lot like this additional miracle that happens here. Jesus heals this guy. He can talk now and see now. And people are like, whoa, is this a Messiah? And literally they say, could this be the son of David? But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, it's only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons that this fellow drives out demons. And then Jesus wrecks them in the next paragraph, pointing out that it would be unbelievably stupid for Satan to fight against Satan. And if you guys say Satan is such a big threat, but he's somebody who fights against himself, maybe he's not such a big threat, points out their nonsense, implosive reasoning. Then he goes on to say, wait a minute, don't you guys do exorcisms? So do you guys exercise in the name of Satan then? Since apparently that's the only way that that can happen. So there's your bump from Jesus. There's your set from Jesus. And then in verse 28, here's the spike. But if I drive out demons by the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. In other words, if we can all agree that you guys just horribly lost that argument, then it points to the reality that the spirit of God is indeed upon Jesus. And therefore the kingdom of God has come upon you. That is important language for where we've been. And that is important language for where we're going. It's important language for where we've been because back at the end of Matthew chapter 3, the spirit literally descends like a dove on to Jesus. God the father is there as well at his baptism. And then just a couple of verses earlier in Matthew 12 quoting again from that servant song in Isaiah 42, the language goes like this. Here's my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love in whom I delight. That sounds a lot like the language that the voice from heaven God the father uses at the baptism in Matthew 3. And then it goes on, I will put my spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nations. Oh, okay. So what Matthew is putting forward is a prophetic literary smoking gun connection to what everyone agrees the Messiah would look like. That is the spirit of God is upon him. And Matthew was already recorded that literally the spirit of God was upon Jesus. And it is by the power of that spirit, according to what Matthew is saying here and quoting from Isaiah that Jesus is able to in the very next anecdote cast out this demon that was causing blindness and muteness. So then again, after Jesus does the verbal bump and the verbal set in response to being accused of working with Beelzebub, the spike is that much more effective because of the language we just revisited. But if I drive out demons by the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. But there's no other explanation for the inarguably good exorcism you just saw the healing that I'm bringing about the messianic looking life and teaching that I am leading that even the crowds are starting to notice and calling me the son of David. If that's what you're seeing, it's the work of the spirit of God who is present in this thing. Now in verse 29, Jesus is going to go from a place of making two defensive arguments that we just looked at Satan versus Satan makes no sense. How do you guys cast out demons by to an offensive argument, a proactive explanation for the good that is happening? He says, or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man, then he can rob the house? That's really fun because it's a place where Jesus is the robber, I guess, in this equation. But the analogy works. What he's saying is no, this isn't Satan fighting against Satan. What you're seeing is the kingdom of truth, of light, of God, of heaven, advancing against something that the kingdom of darkness has owned. And so what's going on here is that every one of these miracles, every one of these truths that is being communicated, prophecies being fulfilled, but especially the casting out of demons given this context is an advance into the strong man's house. It's a securing of the ruler of the dark world kingdom. That being the very prince of demons or Satan himself, that the Pharisees were trying to suggest that Jesus was in league with. I don't think Jesus just randomly chose this particular word picture. I think he's playing off of a very rift upon name in Jewish culture, in the Hebrew language, that being again, Beelzebub. Beelzebub comes up for the first time, I think at first Kings, I don't know, we looked at it a few chapters back when we were in Matthew chapter nine. And the different Hebrew renderings of the name of this particular Beel, this pagan God, all of these names are a riff. They're all a mockery. People have drawn linguistic connections that suggest that instead of talking about this great Lord of power, they would be more akin to the Lord of dung or the Lord of flies or the Lord of flies that congregate around dung. But my understanding from people way smarter than me is that a pretty good case can be made that the original actual positive pagan name of this deity could be translated Lord of the high house or to put it another way, somebody who owns a castle or an enormous property and is master of that territory. So then if that is the case, that would resonate neatly with Jesus using this example of this Lord of the high house, having ownership of this lofty castle. And in order to break into that stronghold and rob such a dark Lord of all of their evil possessions as the analogy goes, one would need to bind up that Lord of the high house first. I think that's what Jesus is doing there. My goodness, I was going to get to all of that stuff about blaspheming the Holy Spirit. I only got halfway through the setup. Why the beelzebub stuff was fun. I want to talk about it. What are you going to do? So here's what I want you to do in your brain and in your heart. I just want you to hold on to what we talked about about the blaspheming the Holy Spirit passage because we're halfway through breaking down how that exactly works and halfway through breaking down why it can't mean what people in high school told me that it must mean. So next time around, we will pick up where we left off with all of this setup fresh in our mind about how Jesus whole argument here is predicated on the idea that all of his work is from the spirit. It's authorized by God and therefore to refute that would be very problematic. We'll break down how next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Put a pin in this one. We're coming right back to it.
