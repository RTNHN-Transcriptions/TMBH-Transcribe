 Hello, my name is Matt Whitman. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And because I am privy to at least a certain amount of podcast data, not as much as you get from YouTube, but you get a little bit of feedback on who listens and everything. Because I'm privy to that, they know that very likely a whole bunch of you have kids and you're in that phase of life who listen, but I can also tell that there are a bunch of you who don't have kids. And so some of you are going to relate to this example and some of you are not, but everybody has had a parent or a guardian or some sort of parental authority figure in their lives. So just plug into this, however you feel you need to. Have you ever been on the giving or receiving end of a conversation about things that are so convoluted and unimportant? You're like, I just, I can't believe we're having to have this conversation as a family right now. Okay. Like your brother's shoe had gum on it. And when there's gum on it and it goes below the tread of the shoe and could theoretically get on the little piece of carpet that you put in your bedroom as a carpet remnant, then it is reasonable to ask the brother to go outside and scrape his shoe before touching your piece of carpet. This is all just hypothetical. I'm sure you can sort the details of some trivial story on your own, but I'm going to finish this thing because I'm committed now. But if your brother comes in there and the gum is old enough and crusted enough into the tread that it does not exceed the tread depth and it is not fresh. And if I were to poke at it with an ink pen, it would crust off instead of gumming off, then you are not within your rights to demand that your brother remove his shoes before walking on your carpet remnant that you bought at Minard's for $9. This is my ruling. Can we please get out with the day as a parent? You just run into situations like that from time to time where you are getting way further into the details of this stupid minutia than you would care to get into it over. But why do you do that? Because you love them. Because as ridiculous as the situation is, the crustedness level of that gum in the tread of the shoe and the depth to which that gum protrudes beyond the bottom of the tread, this is an actual question that is actually affecting the well-being of the family and the household. It's affecting the relationship between two people you love very much and whose relationship with each other. You want to be one that is thriving and wonderful and reflective of things that are beautiful. And so from time to time, you just got to get in there with a scraping tool, pull off a shoe, evaluate it and make some ground rules for how to interpret shoe gum depth on carpet remnants. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 23, I really don't think that just a couple of days before he's going to be brutally murdered by being nailed to a big giant chunk of wood in front of everybody, pretty much naked and shamed, then Nav is back turned into a hamburger with a giant, floggy bone and stone whip. I don't think Jesus is like, you know what I want to do today? Not so much mentally prepare for what I'm about to go through. I want to deal with people making weasily promises in public about technically, I did not say that that was a real promise. I only swore by the temple and we all know that swearing by the temple doesn't mean you actually have to do it. It's more like I might do it or I might get to it. Now if I had sworn by the gold in the temple, that would be different, but that's your fault for not listening. Dad, that was a temple swear and I could have sworn I saw the mouth, the word the gold of the temple to as we look at Matthew chapter 23 and all of this business about woe to you blind guides. Say if anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath as we look at this stuff. I do not want to give some false impression that this is the heart of the Bible. This is the stuff that God broke the laws of time and space to send his son to take on flesh in the world, birthed by a virgin, living a perfect life and going obediently to the cross to die there a sacrifice for the sins of all humankind, not coming to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many to be raised on the third day back to life to ascend to the right hand of the father so that he could take a few minutes in the temple to argue with people about how old Zott to be. This is a concession. This is a necessary acknowledgement of the mundane and the trite and the who cares to point out what happens when you don't do religion and you don't do relationships in a way that is reflective of kingdom values, but you still put a teeny tiny little shine on the outside to make it look like it's inspired by kingdom values. Jesus is stooping to deal with this stupid trite trivial debate and to indicate to anybody who might be paying attention what it looks like when not kingdom values things are happening with a kingdom Vernier slapped over the top versus what actual kingdom values look like back to Matthew 23. So he says the stuff about woe do you blind guides and he goes on more specifically to deal with this nonsense debate about whether you swear by the temple or the gold and blind fools which is greater the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred. And I think pretty clearly his point here is not to be like, well, now let's get into this because I think there's a debate to be had about where the actual value occurs. He's lumping it all in together like by your own ground rules for how this debate is unfolding. It's dumb and by your own ground rules, you're still being hypocrites, even though you gerrymandered those ground rules to make yourselves a good stupid verse 18. You also say if anyone swears by the altar, no, that means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift on it, well, you found by his oath, you blind men, which is greater the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred. So Jesus has now used the same formula two times back to back to point out that your silly conversation about truth and not truth and vows and keeping them and breaking them is framed completely wrong and is hypocritical from the start. You're asking all the wrong questions with this. You're justifying things in the wrong way. How about just like truth, which is what he gets to with the therefore here in verse 20, therefore, this is Jesus talking, he who swears by the altar, swears by it and everything on it. And he who swears by the temple, swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. And he who swears by heaven, swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. This is one of a handful of places where I feel like the author of Matthew is projecting a version of Jesus who looks like Chris Pratt and Jurassic Park or world or whichever one he was in with his hands out, trying to calm all the velociraptors settle down here. We're going to make the final pronouncement. This is how the thing actually is or like me with my hands out with the kids talking about what tread depth and what gum consistency merits scraping it off before you walk over the carpet remnant or not. I don't want to have to have this conversation, but if we're going to have it, let's get all the way down to base level truth and look guys, whether you are talking about the building or the gold in the building or the table in the building or what's on the table in the building, it all comes back to the deity behind it. The temple has value because God lives in it. The altar has value because it's where things happen that are meant to exalt God. The gold is in it not to prove how rich you can be because it's the finest. It's offered for God. So if you guys are going to take oaths and it's going to involve God stuff, think of it in the context of God and his understanding and instruction on what truth is and on what truth is not. This is a supporting point detailing and exemplifying the earlier very bold, very dangerous charge of hypocrisy that Jesus leveled against the religious leaders in public at the beginning of chapter 23. And I'm sure that like me, many of you are going, Oh, wow, this is so many woes. Yeah, I'm with you. It is a lot of woes. And let me just state again for the record. I'm not Jesus. I don't imagine myself to be Jesus. I feel critiqued by these woes, but also I want to try to handle this stuff with the same tone that we've talked about everything else with. And so we are taking our time. We are trying to unpack them carefully. I think it is important for understanding the whole document. Please, if anything about the way I'm saying it or we're going through it, makes it sound like I am descending from the mountain of knowledge morally or intellectually to tell you how your behavior ought to be and how you ought to think about all the things that I'm saying it stupid. And please forgive me. Cut me some slack. Assume my good will. It's way harder than you would actually figure to go through a passage like this with thousands and thousands of people, most of whom you've never met and you'll never interact with in any way. There's some pressure there. And I don't want to give the impression that I get this stuff right. I don't want to give the impression that I'm somehow morally exceptional. Oh my goodness, I am not. This text is a critique of me. This text is changing me. Thank you for your grace in letting me bumble through it with you here in this way. And thank you for being forgiving when at any point I venture off into sounding like I'm the one who owns these words or I'm the one who exemplifies these words as just me not communicating well. So with that said, I think we got one more brief round with woe number three and then we're on to woe number four. Look at that. Today was like the halfway point of woeing. This is very, very exciting. All right, more on this later on. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
