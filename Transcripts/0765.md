 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. We're talking about Matthew 27, or I should say, run a really interesting, relevant rabbit trail, born out of Matthew 27, where we meet Joseph Haverimathea, who chooses to take a great risk and take custody of the body of Christ to bury him in his own tomb. But over the centuries, Joseph Haverimathea comes to be believed to be the guy who at one point didn't just have custody of the body of Jesus. He also had custody of the most powerful, most interesting, most significant, most legend and myth worthy artifact from this era of all time, that being the Holy Grail, which I suppose you could say is kind of the Holy Grail of relics. I'm gonna have my buddy, Jeff, play some music and we'll get back at it. Oh. Oh. So I say again, when it comes to the history of relics, you have some people who, and I would say most people within Christianity would be like, dang, if that artifact is in some way physically associated with a great saint or something from the Bible or most of all, the stuff about Jesus' death and resurrection, it'd be pretty cool to be there, to go to the place where Jesus stood, to touch the stairs, Jesus climbed on his way into Pilate's palace, to go to the tomb if we knew for sure where it was and to put your hands on the tomb where Jesus' body laid. I think everybody throughout the history of Christianity would acknowledge, hey, if it's real, that's pretty cool. And I certainly think that's pretty cool as well. And it reminds you, we're talking about with the Bible, real people in real places at real times, this isn't just a made up fantasy land, this is held out as being a real thing that happened in a real measurable time and place, so cool. But then we also have to acknowledge that this is a spectrum of belief about relics and artifacts and physical associations with the miraculous things of the past. And on the other end of that spectrum would be people who say, no, there is still active power in those things. And if you get even a little tiny chunk of a bone from Mary Magdalene and you put it in the altar area of your church, there is extra power in that. They would view something like that as a thin spot between this world and the next. And they would imagine that there would be some kind of lingering power of God presence in this holy person or in this holy artifact. And maybe they'd even go so far as to believe that somehow that's transferable through contact. But all the way back to the point when it comes to the conversation you and I are having about relics through the years here, I think the Holy Grail is the big one. Now I don't know what it was before the Arthurian legends of the high Middle Ages started to really catch on because clearly Joseph of Arimathea and the Holy Grail and all of the knights of Camelot going on Grail quests was a very central theme in what is called the Arthur or the Camelot cycle that is a series of writings, fan fiction, legend, myth that were written by lots of different people compounding off of each other. But one of the constant themes is this assertion that Joseph of Arimathea from Matthew 27 finished up all of this stuff that he did as evening approached. He went to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in clean linen, placed it in his own new tomb. He cut out of the rock, he rolled a big stone in front of the tomb and he went away after all of that. And then Jesus comes back to life according to these Arthur legends, Joseph went to the Glastonbury, England area and his name is still associated with that part of the country. So is King Arthur's for that matter. And one of the constant themes in all of these otherwise disparate Arthur stories from the Middle Ages is that Joseph of Arimathea brought with him the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail isn't exactly a Bible idea. It's a myth legend after the fact, maybe church tradition idea suggesting that Joseph of Arimathea somehow came into custody of the cup Jesus used to institute communion and that somehow Joseph of Arimathea went to the cross and caught the blood of Christ in that chalice. Just for a moment, let's step aside and consider the veracity of that. Could that have happened? Sure. Yeah. Oh, why not? If Joseph of Arimathea had heard about what Jesus said about communion and his body and his blood and all of that, he would have been a person of prominence who would have had access to walk right up by the cross. It doesn't strike me as a wildly plausible tradition, but whether that happened or not, it sure captures the imagination of people because of, well, particularly the church doctrine about communion. Now, this is not as universal a doctrine in the early churches as often held out as being. That's a debate and discussion for another day, but surely there's a robust thread in the first several centuries of Christianity about what actually happens in communion in the literal nature of the body and blood. Now, we know it wasn't unanimous because we're aware of debates between very prominent, intellectual figures, prominent monks going as far as into the ninth century, debating exactly what is the thing you drink when you take communion? Is it the literal transformed blood of Christ? So acknowledging that there's some debate there, you've got to see though, that if people are believing, they know that, is when the priest pronounces the blessing over the cup of communion, the cup becomes the blood of Christ, well, then people would be very, very even more interested to lay hold of the cup through which communion was instituted and that once held the literal blood of Christ, it's like a mingling of these two understandings of the blood of Christ and what it means and what it does. And so it becomes the treasure of all treasures, the thing everybody would want. And so all of these interesting details and mysteries about Joseph of Verimathia get scribbled down in the Middle Ages and these nights go on quests, obviously, lampooned by the famous Monty Python movie to go and try and find this grail. Well, why were they looking for the grail? One, cause it's really interesting, but I don't think they were throwing that kind of energy at it because they had that symbolic belief about relics and artifacts being really neat and appointed interesting connection with the miraculous work of God throughout the centuries, the view that I hold, no, no, no, they wanted to find it because they believed it would possess some sort of supernatural power and the tradition is that it would possess the power of life. And so all of that to say, I think it's really interesting when you have a character who isn't on the page much in the Bible, who pops in public imagination, disproportionately to how much they're in the Bible, I think Joseph of Verimathia is one of those guys. As Matthew is writing this, he's effectively throwing down the gauntlet and saying, go look it up for yourself. Go check with these witnesses, go to the town, go to the tomb, see if the body's still there, just check it for yourself. But as time goes on and entropy gradually deteriorates, lays waste to those physical points of commonality between later Christians and the events described in the book of Matthew, well, then the value, the premium goes up on those little physical remnants that might still be around. And why wouldn't a person who is a follower of Jesus be curious and interested to put a hand on something associated with the Bible? I'll never forget the first time I did that. I went to Athens, I went to the place where Paul gave his speech, like, huh, here it is. This is it, right here next to the Acropolis, this is Mars Hill. This is where Paul famously got up and gave his men of Athens speech. And I stood up right there reading to no one. It was basically empty and it was just amazing to physically encounter something that is a part of this story in any way. So Joseph Verimathea for me is interesting because of what happens on the page, but he's also interesting because I think he naturally prompts a conversation between you and I. That healthy question is, whatever became of all this stuff, did people preserve it? Is any of it still around? That's a really long time ago. How many places could I go in the world where we just know for sure the Bible happened right there? How many physical objects could I touch? Man-made or natural that we know were involved in these stories? I just think that's a hyper interesting conversation, but also, and I suppose this is where I wanna land the plane, it's not the point clearly, this conversation we've had the last two days feels rabbit-traily because it is. The point is Jesus, the Son of God, that's what Matthew is laying out for us here. That's who he wants us to be thinking about. That's the story he wants us to be leaning into. And it looks like what's being suggested is that a kingdom, a reality is happening here and is in fact being validated and realized by the work of Jesus we're reading about right here that is bigger than the physical. That is bigger than what thieves can break in and steal and then what moth and rust gradually destroy, but that instead we're talking about a treasure that transcends the physical transcend time, transcend death. And so the Joseph of Averimathea stuff is interesting. The relic stuff, the points of physical connection stuff is interesting and indeed there are some really neat physical points of connection that still exist that you can go and see. But in my opinion, the guaranteed miracle that the text holds out every interested person having access to is life in Christ, is being made new in Christ, being made a citizen of this kingdom, being made someone who's gone from being an enemy of Christ to a son, a daughter, a child, an agent, a citizen, an heir of the kingdom. I am not detecting in the text some promise that the outlier events that occur from time to time in the Bible are somehow normative and that they should be expected in all situations. Also, guess what? I don't need to be right about everything. And maybe I'm reading the thing wrong. Maybe I'm mistaken on this. Final thought, this episode of the podcast is brought to you by Samaritan Ministries, which has been absolutely awesome for my family for years and years, much longer than I've been doing stuff on the internet. It's a community of Christians who pay one another's medical bills without the use of insurance. I mean, you probably tell from hanging out with me here that I'm a little bit of an independent minded gentleman. I like to be very hands-on and informed in terms of my family's healthcare, healthcare decisions for myself. Samaritan enables that and that's part of what makes Samaritan a super good fit for me, for people like me, maybe like you as well. Samaritan, there's no enrollment period, so you can sign up whenever you want. You're not getting things dictated to you by the calendar. There's no networks, so you can get the healthcare that you think makes the most sense. Some people have received tremendous benefits from alternative medical treatments, natural methods of care that works with Samaritan. Being a part of this community puts the person who is most invested in you and your family's health, that being you and the person who has the most on the line when you receive healthcare, that being you, it puts you in charge of your decisions. Monthly share amounts for an individual start at 99 bucks and for a family of three or more, it starts at 263 bucks. You can learn a whole lot more about this big idea, this good idea at Samaritan Ministries.org slash T-M-B-H. We're gonna look more specifically at the obstacles that Matthew is setting up, that the resurrection, that God is gonna have to overcome, if Jesus is gonna come back to life next time around here at the end of chapter 27. That's crazy, Matthew 28 is right on the horizon. All right, this is fun, I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. Let's do this again soon.
