 Here's an interesting thought exercise for you. I'm going through this with you right now on my own. I want you to think back to the first movie you ever saw that had a post-credits scene. What do you got? I started with like superhero movies. I remember something from when I was a kid. And even though I'm pretty sure this would not be the first ever post-credits scene, I am almost 100% positive, though not having Googled it, that the young Sherlock Holmes had some kind of post-credits scene. Maybe out in the snow, in the woods or something? I don't know. I've only seen it once. It was when I was a kid. But I think you can take that to the bank. There was a post-credits scene in that show, young Sherlock Holmes starring no one who I can remember at all, standing out from that. But then obviously, superhero movies and stuff come out since then. I think my favorite post-credits scene is the one in one of the James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, X-Men, where they go to recruit Wolverine in the bar. It's a PG-13 movie. And you're all the way to the end of the movie. And they still haven't used their 1F word. I'm like, well, how are they going to get it in? And they walk into the bar. And I'm like, I know exactly what you're going to do here. And Hugh Jackman tells them to get lost. He's not joining their dumb team. And that's the end of the cut scene. But maybe one of the most useful uses of the post-credits scene happens at the end of, I guess I would be Infinity War, where it seems like all hope is completely lost. The Thanos snap has occurred, but they use that post-credits scene to give you one little glimmer of hope. That button got pushed. Maybe help is on the way. And you should stay tuned because there's some important resolution coming to this thing. And I feel like in Second Chronicles at the very end of this very, very spiraling, depressing sad story that culminates with Nebuchadnezzar of the Neo-Babylonian Empire showing up and toppling what was left of the southern kingdom of Judah and literally toppling the temple, the great, splendid temple that Solomon had made, right at the end of that very sad story we get a post-credits scene that is the end of the two books or the singular book we divide out into two that is Chronicles. And it is about a guy from Kingdom or region we haven't even really heard of at this point in our reading of the Bible directly and chronologically. This guy is supposedly from Persia, but help is on the way. And here's the preview that we get after this very sad story about the destruction of the temple and this darkest day, Second Chronicles ends on this note. Second Chronicles 36 starting verse 22. In the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus, King of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it into writing. This is what Cyrus, King of Persia says, the Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Anyone of his people among you may the Lord his God be with him and let him go up. And then we get the very final last closing credits and the studio insignia shows and then it goes to black and the lights come up in the theater and you got to make the moral decision about whether you're going to throw away your popcorn trash properly or just leave it there and then not make eye contact with the poor kid who gets paid to pick up your mess. And that's the end. And then you rush to the super overly crowded sticky floored bathroom where you got to wait in line because everybody else was holding out too because there's a really good story and nobody wanted to miss anything. And the whole time you're there, you're thinking about that movie in general about the sad story and how things were going well. And there was a temple and the temple got destroyed and it's very sad. But you also can't get that after credit scene out of your head. Cyrus Persia, a new temple. Some of the language there even sounds like this is a pretty unique blessing or revelation from God. How does that all fit in there? Man, I can't wait to see the next movie to see how this one turns out. Well, in most expressions of the Old Testament as we have it ordered now, those answers start to come into focus like on the very next page. Boom, right there. You flip over to Ezra and you realize, whoa, time warp. Like we've jumped forward and entire mega empire. We've jumped forward a whole bunch of time here where the Babylonians go. Like Babylon seemed invincible just a page ago with Nebuchadnezzar. He was powerful enough to march halfway across the known world and topple a powerful, wealthy people group and he had the money to take him away into captivity. I mean, that's got to be super spendy to have baggage caravan like that, let alone feed him once you get him back home. And now Nebuchadnezzar is gone and he's replaced by the Persians. How did all that happen? Well, the fun, interesting, complicated version of that story is probably content for another day and another podcast. But the simple version is this. The Babylonians spread themselves too thin doing stuff like this and Nebuchadnezzar, he had some issues that are pretty heavily documented in other books of the Old Testament. The demonstrate he was hanging by a thread at times and even the God of Israel, it looks like did some stuff with him. The ultimate result though is that Babylon played its cards well for a little while, but over the long haul, they fell victim to a lot of the same problems that all these ancient empires fell victim to stretch to thin, spent too much money. Lavish and dulgent court life leads to fat, ineffective leaders who can't duplicate their father's success and outsiders who are sick of being oppressed and are gathered at the borders, licking their chops at having the kind of resources it would take to build a giant hanging gardens. Eventually, they see their opportunity and they come in and they do some conquering. And that's what the Medes and the Persians did. And so the Persian Empire replaces the dominant Babylonian Empire in October of 538. And that is recorded in the book of Daniel. If you read through the book of Daniel, it's in general a lot of this in between second Chronicles and Ezra stuff comes into focus there and you get the ongoing narrative from an Israelite perspective there as well. So it's kind of a fill in movie that comes after the fact that you can go and get the bottom line is second Chronicles ends saying that hey, Cyrus came along and God did some kind of thing and Cyrus decided to let the Israelite people go back and rebuild their temple. Ezra picks up with how that process works out as row one one in the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah. The Lord moved the heart of Cyrus, the king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it into writing. This is what Cyrus King of Persia says, the Lord, the God of heaven has given me all kingdoms of earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Anyone of his people among you may has God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the Lord, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem and the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold with goods and livestock and with free will offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem. This is massive. The most powerful person in the world just out of the blue takes pity on you. What an incredible reversal of fortune and one of the really interesting themes that plays out about this reversal of fortune brought about by the miraculous provision of God to keep his promises to his people in terms of their relationship with Persia is that their relationship with Persia starts with a reversal of fortune and then that theme is repeated in the very interesting, maybe even appealing for a long term, say daily Bible podcast to go and dig into at some point down the road. The book of Esther also has this reversal of fortune theme while also dealing very much with this concept that God ultimately is the one who directs the hearts of kings to do the stuff he wants, whether it's to accomplish his grand purposes of rebuilding a temple or to make them look like the clowns they are to demonstrate the foolishness and impotence of these man-made kingdoms and states that come and go and wither like the grass so quickly in contrast with the reality of the quiet, strong lasting power of the one true king and his kingdom. This is one of those conversations where I'm just going to keep going right now sitting here at the mic, but I'm going to divide it into two days. It's going to be just a little too much as I look at the clock if I try to cram it into one. So we're going to split this up into two conversations. I will finish that recording right now. We'll pick up right where we left off next time around. Quick housekeeping note, big thank you to whoever it was who rightly pointed out on the subreddit that the Christopher Guest film I forgot the other day was a mighty win. The one about folk music that one was really, really funny. Good call. Final additional housekeeping note I groveled for reviews on the podcast and some of you did that and it was very helpful. It's always helpful and it makes it possible for new people to easily find the podcast and become involved when you do that. So to everybody who's new here, hey, thank you for being here. Glad to have you. And if you enjoyed it in any way, you can just mentally high five the people who were kind enough to endorse this thing in front of others so that it got served up to you. If you didn't like it, I would invite you to still think positive thoughts toward those people and the reviews they wrote. Y'all are awesome. More temple stuff tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
