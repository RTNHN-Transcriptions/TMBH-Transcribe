 Hey, my friends, Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and also hey to my new friends. People are just jumping in. Thank you for giving this thing a go. I know it's weird and a big commitment to jump in with a new podcast, especially one that is as well established as this. And I've noticed that a lot of people have decided to put a toe in the water and try this out here over the last couple of weeks. But we've been in sticking with the water metaphor, the deep water really trying to bring out, Hey, that's a third water metaphor. Look what I'm doing there and I accidentally now really trying to ring out every last drop of detail and connection and completion every Easter egg that we're finding here in Matthew chapter 26. And it just occurs to me that we haven't really taken a moment to just be like, Hey, what do we do here? And how does this work for those of you who are new? So here's the quick version. We've been working our way through the book of Matthew one little bit at a time every weekday morning. We've been doing this since October of 2019 and we try to keep it around 10 minutes of content, but you know, you got some housekeeping stuff, a little bit of music that we liked playing at the beginning and the end, but hopefully it's roughly 10 minutes a day of really thinking hard about the biblical text. I mean, we've only worked our way through most of one book of the Bible so far, the book of Matthew, we're going to do other ones coming up down the road. The next step is up next. My buddy Jeff helps me with editing and he makes all the music. So sometimes the music is part of the fun and we put little musical Easter eggs in there that are a joke or a reference to something that we talked about in the show. So if you're new and you're wondering why that kind of nonsense happens, that's why because it's reflected my warped sense of humor and reflective of the fact that we're dealing with really profound stuff. And I don't know. One of the luxuries of the internet is that we can ratchet back the intensity a little bit here because of the nature of the medium. It's kind of one sided, right? Like I got a microphone, but it's just me here in my basement and I talk into the microphone and wherever you are in life, whatever you're doing, you receive that on your end. So it's kind of a conversation, but it's different than other conversations. And ultimately you're going to do with this, what you need to do with it. And what I hope we accomplish is that we treat this document that holds itself out as being literally from the maker of all things and that holds itself out as dealing with literally the culminating event in the grand, redemptive plan for all of history that the architect of all of history and creation has brought about according to the book of Matthew and the Bible in the person and life and death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. So it's big gigantic stuff. And sometimes we get to that place where there's just no way tonally to do anything but to acknowledge that, no, no, this is really, really weighty. But I don't know. I think there's something valuable too about taking a little bit of the edge of having a laugh about things where we can being humans and understanding that we're not ultimately all going to think the same stuff. But we can work together to try to get to a place where we are holding the whole document, one book of the Bible, one that is all about Jesus at once in our brains. It's like the goal here is to expand the cash to use the old computer metaphor so that we've got a whole bunch of memory that instead of holding just little glimpses of Matthew at once and then you make connections and maybe you're there, maybe you don't make any connections at all. Instead, the way we're pacing through this, the idea is let's hold the whole book in front of us at once. Let's spread it out on the table. Let's put it up in the basement conspiracy board with all the thumbtacks in the red yarn and see the whole thing for once and try to understand those connections and make those connections for ourselves so that we're giving this incredibly important, incredibly influential book a really honest look that is reflective of the enormous importance that people for thousands of years before us have placed on it as well. The idea is to get the book of Matthew in our hip pocket to think about it real hard, understanding that we're coming from different backgrounds. We're at different moments in life. We're going to land in different places and also acknowledging that I think things. I bring biases to this conversation and I like those biases. I think there's a God. I think God is behind this document. I think Jesus is the son of God. I'm a Christian. If you're not a Christian, I'm not going to lie. I hope you become one of those because I think there's truth in it in life. I think it's the truest, realest, best thing ever. I think the kingdom of God is the best thing ever. Also once again, it's the internet and that means that I have to relinquish whatever imagined notions I have of control over everybody else. And instead we just get to do it collegially. And I think that's a great setup and it takes the pressure off, but it also buys us time together with people who maybe aren't exactly like us to think through what I believe is the most important thing ever. So that's what we're going for here. A little bit of a reset. Thanks for hearing me on that, whether you're a veteran of the 10 minute Bible hour podcast or your brand new. I'm super, super, super glad you're here. And today we need to take a little more time to talk about this Matthew 26 thing. Because if you've been hanging around for the last couple of weeks, you know that we are in the home stretch of Jesus time with his disciples. Jesus time as a free man as we politically think of being a free man. He just hosted the last supper, a Passover meal that was both beautiful and bizarre in that meal at the beginning of Matthew chapter 26. He interrupts everything to be like, yeah, somebody here is going to betray me. Like, you know, basically to death and everybody's like, what? No, it's not going to be me. And Jesus pulls probably one dude aside. It looks like he must have pulled him aside given the way the rest of the meal worked out. He's like, no, it's totally going to be you. You're going to betray me. So, knock yourself out champ. What you're going to do there. I guess go get after it quickly. And then after that, the meal rounds out with this beautiful thing where Jesus takes the bread and the company initiates the Lord's Supper, sacrament and ordinance of the church that Christians have celebrated to remember the sacrificial work of Christ on the cross and his resurrection and the establishment of the new covenant, the new deal between God and humanity that effectively puts in motion the beautiful kingdom of God and the values of the kingdom that people are invited to and made citizens of by the work of Jesus. You go from being an outsider, even an enemy of the kingdom to a son, a daughter, a child, an agent, an heir of the kingdom, a full participant in this most beautiful way that things could be. And so this Lord's Supper stuff, it points to all of that, it reminds people of that and all of that has happened in Matthew 26. Then they sing a hymn and they go out and over to the Mount of Olives, which wouldn't have been too long a walk. They go to the garden of Gethsemane. That's where we've been for the last couple of weeks. And in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus pulls aside Peter and James and John and he's like, all right, we're going to go over here and pray. And remember, Peter is just like, I'm never going to let you down. I'm with you forever. You can count on me 100% James and John, just a few chapters earlier. Their mom was asking Jesus if they could sit at his right hand and left hand in the established kingdom. And Jesus is like, I got a drink from a cup. You guys can't drink from it. And they're like, no, we'll drink from the cup. Bring us the cup. We are so absolutely ready. And she's like, oh, you're going to drink from my cup. But it's not like you guys don't know where you guys don't get it. And they're like, oh, we can do it. Well, those are the three people that Jesus takes with them and they can't even stay awake to keep watch because they're not reading the situation. Jesus is dealing with this deep emotional, overwelmetness that he's experiencing at the level of his soul and they can't even stay awake. Like they can't drink from the cup. They're not willing to do whatever it takes. Like you can't even hang with Jesus for this night. You can't even read the situation. So it demonstrates here the frailty of the disciples contrasted with the enormous fortitude of Jesus as he faces this thing down. And then after three times going off and praying to God, the father who at least as Matthew records it is silent. He doesn't swoop in and be like, all right, I got you. Yeah, I'm going to take this cup of suffering from you. I understand it's a lot. It's overwhelming. We'll just come up with a different plan. Thanks for carrying the ball this far. Nope. It sounds kind of like abandonment. He's not hearing from his father at all. And his friends aren't with him. It looks like if they couldn't withstand this test, man, second, the pressure gets ratcheted up at all. They're just going to scurry. Jesus is looking pretty alone and things at least from a human perspective are looking pretty dire. Plus he doesn't even have all of his disciples with them because one of them is off. Making arrangements to sell them out, which is what happens now. Matthew 26, 43 says when he, Jesus came back, he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time saying the same thing. Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near and the son of man. That's language that Jesus draws on from the Old Testament to describe himself. It looks like just in terms of number of uses, son of man is his favorite title for himself is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let's go. Here comes my betrayer. And while I was still speaking, Judas, one of the 12, it's kind of funny that Matthew clarifies that. I've never noticed that before until right this moment, like we know Matthew, we know that he's one of the 12 that's remember he uses the Lord's Supper a couple minutes ago, like not even one page turn ago. Yeah, we know. So why would he say that? Well, I think Matthew, my guess is he's probably trying to punctuate like this guy should be one of the inner circle. Maybe Matthew's trying to be like, Hey, yeah, well, we did. It wasn't that impressive, but at least we didn't do that. I don't know. It's just interesting that he points out who Judas is again. So while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the 12 arrived with him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. The one I kiss is the man arrest him going at once to Jesus. Judas said, greetings, Rabbi and kissed him. There's so much going on here that is so dang gross. Church like church sent a bunch of people out with swords and clubs. This is sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people. What the heck has gone wrong with your religion? This is a mess. And for those of you, and I know there are a ton of you who are not Christians and you have a critical eye for some of the stupider things about Christianity over the last couple thousand years and there have been plenty of screwed up weird stupid things about Christianity. Maybe you hear that and you're like, Hey, self awareness, much 10 minute Bible thing. Come on, pay attention, dude. How many times is the church taking up arms, taking up the sword and done violence in the name of Jesus, making the exact same mistake is here. You can't pick on the Jews for that and give your own team a pass and you, my friend, you are absolutely right and you are making a great point. What is ugly here when the Jewish religious leadership does it is also hideously disgusting when representatives of the kingdom of God do it in the name of Christ and his church. Blood shed and violence just ain't a good look for the people who are supposedly agents, heirs, ambassadors of the kingdom that has values like the ones that Jesus described at the beginning of Matthew chapter five and the sermon on the mountain, the beatitudes and all of that. So we got that element of just the violent gross part of that. Then we also have the fact that the betrayal happens with a kiss. We got to talk about that more tomorrow. There's so much there, but the irony, the grossness of it is immediately evident even as we pass by the fact that he greets him. Greetings, Rabbi. Hey, what do I have? All these guys with me on no reason? You know, just say this is him. And this is all happening within minutes, hours of what Jesus and Judas just discussed at the last supper, gross, gross, gross, gross. We'll break down all of the ugliness of the betrayal tomorrow and we'll keep on working on getting Matthew in our hip pocket as we move forward. Cool. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
