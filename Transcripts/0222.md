 I haven't recorded it yet, but I predict that the episode you're about to listen to is gonna be really enjoyable and Something that you'll cherish deep down in your heart. However, I also think it might make youngsters cry at one or two points See, I want to preview this one first if you listen with kids Literally Hitler was an insult that people used a whole bunch like seven years ago whenever they throw this at people on the internet I'd always wonder like well, what aspect of Hitler are you comparing this person to because there's a lot of bad things that Hitler did I mean you get the holocaust that's obviously Horrific murderous on the grandest scale. We've ever imagined as humans You could also point out that Hitler was ruthless and paranoid and how he ran his country in a dictatorial Fashion and what happened to people who dissented that was pretty horrible There's also just the way he prosecuted World War two which was violent and showed very little regard for even the lives of his own Soldiers and I know at this point some people like well Stalin's bad too. I obviously Stalin is that they're all so bad They're also very very bad, but literally Stalin isn't an insult So I'm not going with that the point is there's just so many things to pick from If you're throwing around the cheap lazy Hitler insult because Hitler did so much bad stuff And I got to think that when each individual person here's that insult being hurled about on the internet They're going to conjure a different image of the horrible things that Hitler did and latch on to a different aspect of the horrible things That Hitler did and they all want to agree Hitler is very bad But they might have different things that pop out to them the most as to what is bad Likewise in Matthew chapter 10 Jesus goes right to a thing that he is sure Everyone in the original audience would agree was really bad But why is it really bad? I think that's a very interesting question that you and I have to ask as a modern audience that maybe the original audience Didn't have to ask as Jesus suggested that Sodom and Gomorrah is Automatically bad now. Here's what he's talking about Matthew 10 starting in verse 1 You've got the 12 disciples. We get a list of who they are then Jesus sends the 12 out on this great big open-world quest To go and tell people about him in so many words. He says it's dangerous to go alone take this He equips them with a great message the kingdom of heaven is near and the ability to demonstrate that the kingdom of heaven is near You don't need to take any stuff your open-world quest should take care of itself people should recognize me as king and they should receive you properly And then he gets into verse 11 of Matthew 10 and he says whatever town or village you enter Search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave That's nice as you enter the home give it your greeting the home is deserving let your peace rest on it Also nice if it's not let your peace return to you Okay, that's kind of sad if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town Oh, it's getting rougher verse 15 I tell you the truth it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town Oh, it just keeps getting more and more intense as we go along and as you can see Jesus has invoked Sodom and Gomorrah here saying that it'll be better on the day of judgment for the most Undesirable Despicable of cities that anybody could conjure in the minds of people in all of history Sodom and Gomorrah Then it will be for one of these little towns up on the North Shore of the Sea of Galilee if they reject their king whoa Okay, again, this is Jesus saying this and he's done miraculous stuff and he said tons of smart stuff He's got in the flesh. I'm not gonna go out and say stuff like this I'm not equipped to do it But he clearly believes he has the authority to do it The text holds him out as having the authority to do it and so he says it so what does it mean? Well Sodom and Gomorrah is gonna conjure any number of negative connotations in the same way that literally Hitler is Going to conjure any number of negative connotations and we're all adults here except for those of us who aren't so let's just go Right through the front door with this obviously this is a politically loaded invocation in the 21st century It would not have been politically loaded in the first century AD for Jesus original audience Because they weren't having the same social political debates and conversations that we're having today so in the interest of you and I getting past our modern cultural read on this passage and Not at all in the interest of me solving all of the debates of the day I want to go back and look at the Sodom and Gomorrah thing to try to get how the original audience would have heard This reference that Jesus is throwing out so you go back to Genesis 1819 pretty much all the way back at the beginning of the Bible and you have a family situation where Abraham and his relative Lot are Navigating where to set up shop and how to live in this very very ancient version of the Near East where maybe 2000-ish BC maybe even more at this point and Lot ends up in the neighborhood of Sodom and Gomorrah and Abraham ends up in Some neighboring territory for the sake of making it quick and then in Genesis 18 in a very interesting chunk of Bible God and Abraham are almost hanging out and God chooses to approach Abraham. I don't want to say as a peer But more like people would talk with other people. It's almost a negotiation and there are a lot of Interesting theological implications to that that would be fun to break down another day But in verse 20 is as then the Lord said the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin is so grievous That I'll go down and see if what they've done is as bad as the outcry that's reached me and if not I'll know and then everybody goes wandering off in that direction and Abraham hangs around. He's like so You're a god. Let's talk about this judgment thing that you're thinking about doing and he negotiates you remember this passage It's like let's say we end up with I don't like 50 decent people in this community We wouldn't destroy it for that right and God's like alright If I find 50 righteous people in the city of Sodom all spare the whole place for their sake and then Abraham Negotiates more and eventually he works it all the way down to 10 and God says for the sake of 10 I will not destroy it So then we get to chapter 19 and this is where the disclaimer that I put at the beginning comes in stuff gets Crazy so these two angels they arrive in Sodom at evening and lots sit in there at the gate and he sees him He's like alright, you know come on down here and please you need to come and stay with me and you can wash your feet And spend the night it's gonna be great and they're like no We'll spend the night in the square. Well, they're there to figure out what's actually going on and lots like whoa I mean in his head is missing I think I know my town it would be better not to do that and so he says a lot insisted so strongly that they did Go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them baking bread without yeast and they ate okay again The next part it is straight up timeless Bible, but it gets weird kids put the kids away Before they gone to bed all the men from every part of the city of Sodom both young and old surrounded the house They called to lot. Hey, where are the men who came to you tonight bring them out to us so we can have sex with them So then Locke goes out and tries to negotiate with them in a way that is really creepy But maybe was the better alternative of the two? I don't know whatever the case they say in verse 9 get out of our way They replied and they said this fellow came here as an alien and now he wants to play the judge They're talking about lot. Well treat you worse than them Whoa, so now they want to have sex with a lot I guess and I'm sorry to use the language, but they want to rape him too or maybe murder him I don't know they kept bringing pressure on lot and moved forward to break down the door. This is insane Picture the scenario. It's like a sex rape riot that's going on in this town with these two guys We were just travelers in the minds of all the people who were here. This is gone to crazyville There's no authority stepping in to do anything about this and so verse 10 We get into the supernatural says but the men inside reached out and pulled lot back into the house and shut the door Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old with blindness So that they could not find the door and they're like alright We're getting out of here and the two men take lot and his family and they all go and run and there is this Destruction this fiery destruction that we hear about in verse 23 by the time lot reached zor the sun had risen over the land Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah from the Lord out of the heavens thus he overthrew those cities and the entire Plain including all those living in the cities and also the vegetation in the land. I understand that might be very troubling material There's a reason that everybody knows this story it pops off the page It raises questions about God and his justice and how it works and his mercy And it also raises questions about what actually did these people get wrong again? We're all adults here except for those of us who were not so let's just go through the front door with this too Some people read the passage and they're like the sin of Sodom is clearly homosexuality Other people look at this and they're like no the sin of Sodom is clearly in Hospitality and look I really don't want to be offensive here But I don't think either of those properly characterizes what went wrong in this scene It would seem like the thing that went wrong could be better described as mass gang rape You got this crazed mob that wants to do sexual violence to people they never even met and anybody gets in the way Sexual violence for you too. Maybe we'll kill you while we're at it. Whatever. They've lost their minds They are in a state of violent sexual aggression That is as insane as seen as I've ever heard Characterized in any literature ever across all of the ages and clearly the judgment of God Based on what the text says comes down on them in a very harsh way So look you read the text however you want you land wherever you want on some of the debates that the modern mind Applies to all of this stuff. We looked at it We saw what it said and as gross as it is I think you and I have seen enough to know that the original audience probably at the most basic level would have heard Sodom and Gomorrah and they would have thought maximum crazy primal base animal instinct evil mob mentality that represents the maximum level of depravity that humanity can achieve and That is what Jesus is probably drawing on when he brings up this reference if that's the worst thing they could picture Then what Jesus is trying to communicate is that a wanton rejection of him as king from people who should Automatically be his subjects is a pretty gigantic deal morally Again, here comes the disclaimer. We're gonna go through every single verse in this entire document That means we're gonna come across stuff that is difficult to talk about and that puts me in a weird spot I can duck it and pretend that it's not there or gloss over it really quickly But I think you're here because you want to think about it with me even if it's the uncomfortable weird stuff And I genuinely believe the best read on this passage is that Jesus is going to the well to draw out the most Odious thing he possibly could in the mind of the original audience To shock them and to shock his disciples into understanding how great and how reasonable his expectation is that people would recognize Him as king if this is troubling if this is unsettling for you Join the club my friend. This is not the easiest thing in the world for me to tackle either But if we want to understand it the way it's written and the way it was written to the original audience Sometimes we have to wait into very difficult stories very difficult things and things that leave us with a sense of discomfort And of course discomfort isn't always the worst thing Maybe some good stuff comes out of that discomfort that we feel when we look at tough passages onto the next thing The next verse we're gonna look at starting tomorrow verse 16 is one of the most important in the entire book of Matthew And I think one of the most important in the New Testament in terms of the trajectory of the kingdom and how it's gonna unfold Once we get past this one little unique little open-world quest that he's sending his disciples out on right here So we'll pick it up there tomorrow. Thanks for hanging with me with this weird one Sorry, the kids probably missed out on this one Make sure to tell them that I love them. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do it again soon
