 Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's play with fire. Let's do something dangerous that has maybe only minimal upside because if I thought for another three minutes, I probably could have come up with some other way to illustrate the point that I want to talk about today, but I didn't think for another three minutes. So we're going with this. You guys hear about Joe Biden? He's president of America right now as I'm recording this. Some people voted for him like him. Some people just didn't like the other guy and voted for him and don't like him. Some people liked the other guy didn't vote for Biden. Some people have probably changed their opinions one way or the other since. That's not my point. My point is that like all presidents, some more than others, it is part of the job to make big bold, ridiculous claims about how things are to move things politically in the way that you need to move them, whether it's rally the base or try to draw the crazy out of the other side, whatever. It's all one big gigantic game. And I for one am enormously grateful that the values of the kingdom kingdom are totally different than this aspect of the values of the world kingdom because it's gross. Whether it's your team doing or the other team doing it. Here's what I'm talking about. These big bold claims. Let's just think about Joe Biden's stuff. A big bold claim that he made that his critics how old about was the claim that if you get this vaccine that it only really existed for a few months at that point, he was sure he was epistemologically certain that you would not get COVID-19 or be able to spread it. Okay. Well, that turned out to be absolutely completely 100% false. Mean critic might say that was a lie. More fair minded person might give him a little bit of benefit that out and be like, that's a dude who wishful thinking really overstated it. We all wish it had worked out better than it did. Whatever is these. Certainly those people who are critics of Biden will look at the fact that that did not at all work out the way he and his administration promised that it would. And then they would say, see, big bold claim didn't come true scoreboard. We can dunk on him over that. Fair enough. That's politics. I mean, you live by the sword. You die by the sword. You got to live with that. But on the other hand, Biden also claimed that the his intelligence said that Russia was stacking up forces and they were going to invade Ukraine. His critics, including me on this point were like, I don't know. It seems like we just always have to have a war and it's kind of scheduled and I'm skeptical of that claim. Well, in Russia invaded Ukraine, then that puts you in an awkward spot. And the really dedicated critic of any president, then when the president happens to be vindicated on a big bold claim, they got two choices. You can do the way you got me on that one. Okay. I thought you were wrong. Turned out you were right. You were right. And I think it's going to be the right thing for me and all of us. But ideally, that's probably the route you want to pick or you hope you would pick. But more realistically, for me and others, when you make big, bold critical responses to big bold claims that politicians or leaders make and then it turns out they were right. Instead, it can kind of send you to crazy. Well, right now you got a gerrymandered things in your own brain to make it so that somehow this politics brings out just wildly unfair thinking. We make emotional decisions and then we believe things that if we were sane and removed from the situation, we would never say or advocate for it. We'd be so much more fair-minded. It gets the best of all of us. It's a dirty game. And again, it's one of the ugly, gross cities of the world kingdom that the kingdom, kingdom stands in contrast to. But my point is we all know what it's like to hear someone of great significance, maybe politically, maybe in some other role, make a big giant claim that is devastating to our side or our opinions or our identity or our sense of how things ought to be if that big bold claim turns out to be true and is vindicated over time. We all know what it's like to become invested in a narrative and to put our name next to a narrative. And we all know what it's like to feel the pressure to frame and hedge and hum and ha and say things that are pretty intellectually dishonest because we simply cannot afford to have had that big bold claim. We didn't like turn out to be right. If you understand these pressures that we all face in modern culture, in modern political discourse, if you understand the tug of war to and fro with your sense of your own intellectual honesty and your own heart that these people put you through when they make these big bold claims, then you understand all people from all of time and you understand people from the first century, particularly the harshest, loudest critics of Jesus who went so hard to the whole so fully on the record in being against him and his big bold claims that they were willing to stake their reputations on executing him being the right call. Well, Jesus makes a big bold claim in front of everyone in Matthew 26. And by everyone, I mean, all of this religious leadership crowd that if it turns out to be false, they all look smart and like they have been faithful, heavily burdened public servants who just had to do the difficult but right thing and they were willing to take that blood on their hands for the good of all of the people they humbly and with a heavy heart serve. But if this big bold claim of Jesus turns out to be true and he is vindicated, these people are monsters who led their people off a cliff and murdered the person that God had promised and that theoretically they had been anticipating and were supposed to lead their people toward responding positively to that being the entire point of their existence and their role. If Jesus big bold claim is vindicated and turns out to be true, these people can't go on. Every one of them should be deposed, shamed, stripped of money and property, disgraced in society. So this is a pretty high stakes moment here when in Matthew 26, the high priest, Kaiaphas, undercover of darkness, having a super sneakily convened mini trial for Jesus as I charge you under oath by the living God. Tell us if you're the Christ, the son of God. And then Jesus comes back and he says, Yep, it is as you say, you said it. You say so. Jesus replied, but I say to all of you, in the future, you'll see the son of man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds of heaven. He doubles down as we talked about last time around, let there be no doubt. Here is Jesus big bold claim. Now he lets them make the big bold claim that he is the Christ, the Messiah, the son of God, the same way he allowed those demons to make the claim that he's the son of God, the same way he allowed Peter to be the one who said it. You say so. He's the one who said it out loud, but here Jesus affirms it in front of everybody where previously he'd only affirmed it in private. Then he doubles down as we looked at last time, alluding to Daniel seven and Psalm 110, strongly messianic language, let there be no ambiguity as to what he's doing or what he's saying here. But then he makes a testable claim. It's one thing to be like, yeah, I'm the Christ. I'm the Messiah, the son of God. Oh, yeah, prove it. I just am prove it. You got to trust me on this one. We don't. Well, I am. Well, maybe so am I then. I mean, it could just spiral into absurdity at that point, but Jesus gives them something testable in follow up. It's not that he just says it harder. He gives them something measurable in the future. You will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds of heaven. If then they don't see anything like that or people of their ilk never see anything like that. I guess his big bold claim was wrong and you could trot out the carcass of that big bold claim and be like, uh, remember when he said this, you could turn it into a meme and circulate it around Jerusalem so everybody could have a laugh and be endlessly reminded about this big bold claim that absolutely fell flat. But and this is where this statement sets up so much of the tension of the rest of the book of Matthew and even what's covered in the book of Acts. But if it turns out that what he said is true and that he is seen sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and that he is seen coming on the clouds of heaven. If anything really happens that vindicates his statement, his affirmation that he is the Messiah, the Christ, the son of God, then the consequences for the people who opposed him and criticized him and condemned him would be devastating to say the least. And further the vindication and the consequences and the emboldened meant for the people who sided with Jesus, even if right now they're like hiding under rocks and stuff would be massive as well. It would be absolutely confirming of everything. It would be the kind of thing that would cause generations of people coming after this to be like, I don't care if you have me eaten by lions in front of people. I know what I saw. I know what I heard. I know what happened. You can't stop me from believing this and telling other people about this because it is inarguably the truest, realist thing. This happened. He made a claim. It went down. He is indeed the Messiah and I won't stop. And frankly, what happened socially in the first several hundred years of Christianity squares with the biblical claim that Jesus is indeed vindicated on these big bold claims and the utter collapse of Jesus opponents here and their institutions is indicative of them having to eat their failures and the public humiliation that came with getting that wrong. Now, there's so many more layers to that. And I want to pull on this thread more and look at the way this plays out. But the biggest thing that I want to hit on today is this is a big bold claim. It is a testable big bold claim. And now all of the parties involved are going to start kind of behaving the way parties involved in big bold claims with their sides today are going to behave. If the big bold claim is vindicated, there's going to be a huge empowerment for the people who are on the side of Jesus. If the big bold claim is utterly debunked, the people who sided with Jesus will become a footnote to history. We'll never hear about them again. And they will endure shame and disgrace as they go back to their lowly jobs in Galilee or maybe just get rounded up and killed as co-conspirators. And that will be the end of that. The people who criticize Jesus in such a scenario will be wildly empowered. But if the big bold claim turns out to be true, the people who are criticizing Jesus and on the wrong side of this are never going to hear the end of it. They simply can't be wrong. It doesn't matter what the evidence says. It doesn't matter what they see with their own eyes. It doesn't matter what happened. They can't admit they were wrong. It's simply become an impossibility. They have painted themselves too far into this corner and the consequences of Jesus being right of him being seen at the right hand of the Father. Well, no matter how much truth would in that scenario have to be run through the ringer, no matter how many lies, no matter how much blood would have to be shed, you're just going to have to do it because that big bold claim is a dividing line in history. It's a sword that cuts in two directions. The stakes of this are gigantic. And we are going to look more at how this big bold claim plays out moving forward. Quick side note, it's been a little while since I last published an episode of Ironwood Rhino. We even had some weird issues at the RSS feed. All of that's good and fixed. And there's a new episode up and I think it's super, super fun. Ironwood Rhino is a show where we bring somebody in to talk about their weirdest outlier experience. And then we use that as a thought exercise to think about how we know things are real or not. We think about the categories we use to think about truth and reality. So it's a nice compliment to what we do here. And if nothing else, I think it's a really fun diversion. So there's a new episode up over there. Please go check it out if you have a moment. Again, it's called Ironwood Rhino. I think you will like the program. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
