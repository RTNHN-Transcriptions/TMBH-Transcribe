 What's up everybody? I'm Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible Hour Podcast, and usually I like to open with some kind of charming story from childhood or pop culture reference or some kind of anecdote that gives us a starting point, a common story to work off of that is in some way analogous to what we're going to be looking at in the book of Matthew, which is what we do here, by the way. We're working our way through the book of Matthew, one little chunk at a time. But today we come to a passage that I think bears a different approach to getting into it because this is one of those deeply personal passages that gets right to the heart of us and our relationships. So I want to do a thought exercise. I apologize in advance. This is going to bring back up some difficult memories probably for you and will not be the most fun thing you do all day, but I hope that it will be helpful before all is said and done. Thought exercise A, I would appreciate it if you would pause this podcast and reflect on the last time you had a relationship go sideways and then get better. Think through the anatomy of it and how it got better, and then we'll pick it back up here in just a second. Welcome back. Thank you for doing that with me. Thank you in advance for continuing to trust me as we do part two of this thought exercise. Now I want you to pause and reflect on the last time things went sideways in a relationship and then did not get better and still aren't better. How did that relationship break? I'll let you pause and think about that for a second. Acknowledging that everybody's different and every conflict is different, my guess is that most of you are going to resonate with what I'm about to say. My guess is that in thought exercise A, the relationship that broke and then got better, the recovery process was characterized by very open and honest, maybe painstaking conversation with the person you had a gripe with and that neither party went outside of that relationship to talk about what had gone wrong. So trust was maintained, the process was good, and even if you didn't come to an ultimate agreement about what went wrong or how things ought to be, you still liked each other afterwards. And maybe it's even better now than it was before the inciting incident. My guess would also be that in thought exercise number two, the one where things go sideways and then it never got better and it's still not better, the story is much less linear. My guess is that when you try to recount the story to other people, it is utter chaos and no one can actually track with what went wrong because it sounds something like this. Well, I was good friends with so-and-so and then they did this thing and I thought that was really screwed up and I mentioned that to my mom and she agreed that that was really screwed up and I don't think she actually told anybody, but she made a Facebook post that kind of hinted at that. Maybe it was a little too specific and then my friend got really mad. So they called and yelled at me a whole bunch and we talked about it a little bit, but it didn't get better. And then I mentioned it to Tanya and she acted like she did not know that. But then I confronted my friend a couple days later and they said they'd already talked to Tanya by the time that I talked to her. And so I knew that they were lying, both of them were, who had they been talking to. So I called my friend and we talked about it and decided that what we should do was this and then I found some other lies that I'm pretty sure it happened. There were some tweets and texts that I did not like. Then they like totally ignored me for two or three days and all of a sudden I'm getting the cold shoulder from a mutual friend who I know they talked to and I called them back on Thursday after that second Monday at the meeting but not at the meeting that was at Chili's and I told them we need to talk and they didn't even want to anymore. And now we don't talk at all and we're not even friends anymore. Did your story sound like that? Because I think you know that's a convoluted mess and most of the stories that involve broken relationships for me, they are that level of stupid sounding petty crazy chaos. And I don't say that to make you feel bad about the fact that you have broken relationships or that I do. I say that to point out our need for some kind of game plan for how to fix stuff when it gets screwed up inside the community of faith and outside for that matter. But if there's going to be this thing that Jesus is characterizing throughout the gospel of Matthew, this kingdom, this new family of faith, this church, even though he only uses that actual word I think twice, if there's going to be this family of faith, it means that you're going to put together a whole group of disparate people, disparate ages, disparate preferences, disparate senses of humor, political persuasions, a hot button, offendable issues. And you're going to throw them all together into a room into one organization. And if you imagine for a second that that is always going to go swimmingly, I think that's naive. The reality is the risk that we take when we have relationships is that we're going to have friction in those relationships. So we can kind of pick one of two things. We can be alone and never have any friction in relationships, but never have any of the blessing of knowing and being known or of camaraderie or of tackling a project together. Or we can have all of those good things. And also we're just going to have to work it out because some stuff is going to get weird when you put people in a room together who are vested in the same stuff. Jesus anticipates that this problem that is common to all of humanity for all of time is going to present itself somewhere in the life of the church and the life of the kingdom. And that is why in the middle of chapter 18, which is the community life discourse where Jesus is trying to set up something that is likely to succeed socially and in terms of how his followers treat others of his followers. Right here in the middle of chapter 18, we get a very simple prescription for how to make these things go. And it goes thusly Matthew 18 starting in verse 15. If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you want them over. But if they won't listen, take one or two others along so that every matter quote, maybe established by the testimony of two or three witnesses, unquote. If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church and if they refuse to listen, even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. So it's a pretty simple recipe here. And you'll notice that it follows, I would assume pretty closely the recipe that you either intentionally or intuitively followed to make the relationship right in thought exercise one, where you did make the relationship right. The relationship that got right probably didn't have the well get poisoned at any point, because you went right to the person you had the issue with and you started working it out. And you did it so privately that maybe nobody else even ever knew there was an issue between the two of you. And therefore you didn't paint yourself into any weird corners by making assumptions about motives or things that you couldn't possibly know. And then telling that to other people. So it spreads like an infection. No, at the most basic level, Jesus is saying, if you have a gripe, some manuscripts, by the way, say if your brother or sister sins against you, some later manuscripts seem to prefer if your brother or sister sins. There's a slight degree of difference between the two. And one is if somebody's making a mess in general, whether it directly affects you or not, go alone and in private and work the thing out. The other would assume that if somebody is specifically wronging you, go alone and in private and work the thing out. But maybe you don't have to if they just are having a general problem. You want to employ patience with that. Either way, the prescription is the same. Just go alone and try to work the thing out. Go and point out their fault just between the two of you. Now, the way Jesus frames this up, the person who is offended is right. Of course, that is not always the case. Sometimes people will be offended. And it turns out that they were wrong about everything. And the other person didn't actually do anything wrong. And you were just misguided in your gripe about whatever it was. The beautiful thing about Jesus teaching here is that even if you're wrong about what you think the other person might have gotten wrong against you or in general, if you follow this process, you're insulated against screwing the whole thing up because you're doing it alone and in private and you're going through all of the right steps in the right order. These steps don't guarantee reconciliation or that the matter will be perfectly resolved. But they do guarantee that you're doing it right and that you're operating in a best practices manner that theoretically everybody within this kingdom of faith that Jesus is describing, you're operating in the same way that hopefully everybody will. So you go, you do the alone and in private thing, no gossip, no triangulating, no manipulation, no talking to a third party to try and figure out what to do. But really deep down, we know that's just triangulating to get people in your camp. I just want to make sure I'm not crazy here, Ted. Let me run this by you. You know you're not crazy. When we say that, we're usually working the room. We are triangulating. So let's assume that we do verse 15, the first step right. We go alone and in private. If they listen, you've won them over. That's awesome. We don't do any more steps. This is great. But 16 assumes they don't. But if they won't listen, take one or two others along so that quote, every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. All right. That's a reference back to the Old Testament notion of what makes for a valid testimony, the kind of thing where it's not just somebody made something up and now you have to go through this whole public process. Somebody else needs to come along and vouch that this thing happened. So apparently then the appropriate place to bring somebody else, an outsider, into the conversation is between verse 15 and verse 16. If they don't listen, take one or two others along. Notice it doesn't say everybody else along enough that you can establish the reality of the situation. And this stage would seem to be not so much about leveraging the influence of two more people, but rather the implicit assumption here is that, okay, if we couldn't work that out one on one with step one, there must be some disagreement about the raw facts of the case. Let's bring in some other witnesses to make sure that we're seeing all of the details right instead of saying, well, if it were that way, then yes, I'd respond this way, but it's not. It's this other way. Well, I don't think it's that way. This is meant to clear this up. It's like a discovery phase in a trial before anything ever really gets rolling in a legal system. So theoretically here you still have the opportunity to maybe win them over brother, sister, I'm sorry, we couldn't work it out with a one on one conversation. It would seem that we disagree about the facts. It is understandable that sometimes we might see things differently or not have the facts straight. We've brought in so and so and so and so to make sure that we're talking about the same thing. Hopefully the way that goes is the person that is being confronted says, oh, my bad. I didn't have my facts straight. And now that I see the reality of the situation, yeah, I'm a step. I apologize. That won't happen again. Please forgive me. Or maybe the offended party who didn't get satisfaction in step one goes and finds a couple of other witnesses and like, hey, we have to address what Carl did over here. And they're like, oh, you don't have your facts straight. No, there's nothing more to address with Carl. You simply have that incorrect and you're pressing the matter in a way that no longer makes sense. And then theoretically, the offended party who went to go get two or three witnesses because they were unsatisfied by step one would have to say, oh, well, that's why we go and talk to other people at this stage because we want to make sure that we have our facts straight and I didn't. And I guess I owe everyone an apology and we need to move forward. And then you do that. My friends, this is a big idea and I don't want to rush it because as I said at the beginning, this really does get us into the heart level stuff. I'm going to break this up a little bit so we have time to process properly. We're going to pause there. We're going to pick up on exactly this thought tomorrow and we'll keep moving forward and making sense of not just what these instructions are, but practically speaking, what it looks like to do them and why Jesus put them here in the first place. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. We'll catch you tomorrow.
