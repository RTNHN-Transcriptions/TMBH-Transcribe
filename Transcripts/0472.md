 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. We are in Matthew chapter 21 looking at this story right here. Early in the morning as he, Jesus, was on his way back to the city, Jerusalem, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, may you never bear fruit again and immediately the tree withered. When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and they said, how did the fig tree wither so quickly? And last time around, I was suggesting that I think this imagery, this living metaphor of the fig tree would have caused the judgment against the northern nation of Israel from the Old Testament described in the book of Hosea to come to mind for the original audience. So that is what we are exploring right now. We'll pick it up where we left off yesterday and keep cruising. Big picture, here's the way the book of Hosea works out. The thing starts with the description of this marriage between Gomer and Hosea. Doesn't seem like this is exactly Hosea's first choice, but it doesn't seem like he gets much of a choice on this one. It looks like it's one of those moments in the Bible where God co-ops human free will and is like, this is happening. We're going to make a point and this is exactly how we're going to make the point. Now the time that Hosea is writing once again, people would be like, ah, you know, our betters have to make some disturbing decisions from time to time. They have to do things that would be morally wrong if we did them as individuals and it's very expensive to fund the bloodshed they need to engage in and the and the haranguing and scheming that has to go on making dubious treaties with foreign powers. And now the court life that they indulge in is very expensive, but they're under a tremendous amount of pressure and those taxes that we have to pay to fund all of these things. I mean, that's the price you have to pay for living in a civilized society. And so there was something of a separation between the normal person who's thriving and basking in wealth and relative comfort. I mean, stunning comfort for the eighth century BC. There's a disconnect between them and some of the ick that has to be done in order to make all of that go. Nobody wants to mess with anything in the mid eighth century. You're just going to have to tolerate the violence, the bloodshed, the lavishness and the dishonesty that's going on with your leaders because if you mess with it, well, the whole precious system might break and we couldn't have that now, could we? But the abuses are getting ludicrous. And one of those abuses is specifically named in Jose a chapter one for why this whole affair is going to have to happen, why this whole metaphor of this marriage is going to have to happen so that people can see exactly how messed up this is and that, yeah, we're going to call in accounts on that. And by we, I mean, God is going to call in accounts on that. It seems like that kind of stuff is just normal and escalating, but it's not normal and it will bring about ruin and God will ultimately be behind that ruin and that judgment that is coming. Jose a one one, the word of the Lord that came to Jose, the son of Biri. I think that's how we're going to say it during the reigns of us. Ziah, Jotham, a has and has a Kaya, kings of Judah. So Judah, that's the Southern kingdom. Most of those kings didn't have the best showing. Some did better. And during the reign of Jeroboam, son of Jehosh, king of Israel, when the Lord began to speak through Jose, the Lord said to him, go take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery and departing from the Lord. So he married Gomer, daughter of Diblium, and she conceived and bore him a son. I'm not positive from the text whether this is God saying, I want you to marry that particular lady of the night. Or if Jose was allowed to pick from any of the single ladies of the night, but one way or another, he does what God says to do, knowing that you didn't really have any option here. And sure enough, they have a kid. Then the Lord said to Jose, ever as for call him Jezreel. That's the kid they have together because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel. And I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel. In that day, I will break Israel's bow in the valley of Jezreel. Whoa, whoa. Okay. Imagine if everybody thought there was an actual God and everybody believed that that God was profoundly invested in, say, your country for me, the United States of America. And imagine if at this time that God did stunning miraculous things in front of everybody from time to time so that everybody knew, like, oh, that's an actual power with actual authority. And imagine if that God had certain spokespeople backed up by miraculous things who from time to time would speak into the situation and call stuff out. And now imagine if believing all of that such a spokesperson said, hey, God wants you to know that he has not forgotten about insert, whichever atrocity of the week you want to insert here. And here comes judgment. Your country is over. It's, it's done. That will be the judgment. The judgment is this is why we can't have nice things and you're not going to have a country anymore. And everyone will know that this judgment is for me and that I am God. It sounds like the rantings of a crazy person in our current environment because we're not in some kind of pseudo theocracy where God interacts with nations in this way. But it would not have sounded like the rantings of a crazy person in this context. True, the prophets were very marginalized at this point, but this would have held water. And Jose would have known, huh, that's, that's the end of my country. And if that's the end of my country, that's the end of like most of the tribes of Israel. And how does that mean that God will keep his promises about how he's going to redeem and what's going to happen next and his whole redemptive plan and the kingdom and the Messiah and everything. Whoa. Okay. Well, I'm a part of the living metaphor that communicates this. So he names his kid, Jezreel and he names his kid, Jezreel in response to what happened in this massacre that needed to be addressed. And that takes us back to second Kings chapter 10. And this incident over here in second Kings 10 is grisly and complicated. The quick version, you've heard of Ahab and Jezebel. They're like the worst bad guys of the entire Kings saga of the Old Testament, violent, vile, murderous, but they were operating again at a pretty wealthy high point in the history of the Northern kingdom of Israel. And their opulence was expensive and their entitlement was grand and people didn't want to stick up for justice when they did unjust things because reading between the lines, it looks like they were afraid they'd mess up the whole system. If they messed with that monarchy, they falsely believed that the monarchy was what provided them with good things and that they could not have good things or function or enjoy life the way they wanted to without that monarchy. They made the mistake of imagining that these corrupt leaders were somehow their friends and that this deal with the devil was something that they had to make. So these two Ahab and Jezreel go unchecked for a long time, scheming domestically, scheming with their foreign neighbors. And eventually there's this guy, Jehu, who is a part of a pushback and apparently a judgment from God against Ahab and Jezebel. Ahab and Jezebel are defeated. Jezebel's death is horribly violent. She's up in a tower when Jehu is wrapped up all of the other conquest and the gig is up for her and describes her as slapping on all of her makeup. She comes out to the window and yells down, Jehu and his guy is like, oh, are you here to serve your master? You're here to murder me and he's like, yeah, throw her down. And so Jehu's men chuck her out of the window and before they can even bury her, she gets eaten all the way down to the bones, leaving only hands and skull by dogs. The author here goes way out of their way to describe how vile and shameful that death is and then modern sensibilities might cause us to say, that's so mean. Like, come on, she died. Isn't that enough? And if we set that aside and just think about it through interpretive lenses, it gives you a sense of how reviled this person was and how much the author lays at the feet of her and her husband, the blame for so much of what's gone wrong. But these are complicated, difficult times and things are upside down morally. And so what we get next is this. Second Kings chapter 10 is right after Jezebel is dead and eaten. Now there were in Samaria, 70 sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab's children and said, as soon as this letter reaches you since your master's sons are with you and you have chariots and horses and fortified city and weapons, choose the best and most worthy of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne, then fight for your master's house. But they were terrified and said, if two kings could not resist him, how can we? So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu. Were your servants and we'll do anything you say, we won't appoint anyone as king. You do whatever you think is best. Then Jehu wrote them a second letter saying, if you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the royal princes, 70 of them, were with the leading men of the city who were rearing them. When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all 70 of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel. When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, they've brought the heads of the princes. Then Jehu ordered, put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning. The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? Know then that not a word the Lord has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The Lord has done what he promised through his servant Elijah. So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor. Jehu then went towards Samaria. At Beth Echad of the Shepherds, he met some relatives of Aaziah, King of Judah, and asked, Who are you? They said, We're relatives of Aaziah and we've come down to greet the families of the king and the queen mother. Take them alive, he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Echad, 42 men. He left no survivor. Now, look, you might hear this story and be thinking about a whole bunch of other stuff in the Old Testament and be like, What's the problem? That's a lot of the same language that other people used when they did violence. Well, the problem is God didn't tell him to do any of that stuff. And the problem is that he executed a whole bunch of little children not because God's judgment, but because he wanted to be king. He made a shrewd political move and was like, All right, pick somebody and send him over. And we'll call him king. You think he would have really done that? No, he's going to kill that kid that they sent over his king. And so wisely, the masters are like, We're not doing that. We see what this political play is. And he's like, All right, then kill 70 children. And they're like, Oh, Keith, okay, here we go. Just don't kill us. J who was bloodthirsty. He went way beyond what he was supposed to do as an instrument of judgment and did so for personal gain in a precedent setting manner. You do that kind of stuff in order to gain power. That sort of damocles is going to hang heavy over your head. You can't rule justly anymore. And this sets a trajectory for everything that leads us right up to the time of Jose and the eventual collapse of the entire northern kingdom at the hands of Assyria. There is so much stuff here, my friends, and I really don't want to short change it. So we are going to stretch this conversation out yet another day and continue to poke around at this Old Testament imagery than this weird marriage between the prophet and the prostitute. And what it all means and how it all fits and how this reflects back on how the original audience would have heard Jesus words with the fig tree in Matthew chapter 21. We're going to do that next time around. All right, we'll pick up right where we left off. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
