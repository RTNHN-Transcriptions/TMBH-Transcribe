 Sometimes when I was young and living at home with my whole family as a kid, my parents would walk out of the house and they would give us a list of things to do, instructions, a laundry list, get all these projects done, or whatever. Other times they would leave the house and they would deal with us, not in terms of what they wanted us to do, but they would leave us with a mental list of how they wanted us to be. They would sit down, they would take an extra minute or two, and they would coach us on how to treat each other, how to think of each other, how to think of our vestedness in the family and in each other's lives, and they would give us a thing or two, like honesty and integrity, patience and grace, kindness and encouragement, stuff like that. They would throw out, it was always too weird, it just occurred to me for the first time. I would throw this stuff out and the idea was exemplify this while we are gone, and if you live by these principles, you don't need all of our other rules because you're probably going to get it right. And so much of this stuff centered around a diminishing of our own pride and our own insistence on getting our way and an elevation of the value of the other two siblings in the family. Likewise, when we get to chapter 18 of the book of Matthew, it is time for Jesus to have that conversation with his inner circle of disciples, presumably with the intention that that conversation would be passed along to successive people who signed up to be a part of the kingdom and to follow Jesus. So in the book of Matthew, you have got five great big speeches of Jesus that divide up the action of the narrative and they get us deep inside the mind of Jesus. And all of these things answer a question. In fancy biblical studies circles, the term here would be these are occasional. That is, all of these speeches are happening and are being recorded by Matthew on an occasion. There's a reason that they're happening in the narrative. There's something Jesus is trying to accomplish. They're not just walls of words that he said randomly in a vacuum for no reason at no particular time. So as you probably remember, the first of the big five speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured is, as like Dora, the explorer, and I'm real quiet for a minute. I'm like, do you see the first speech? And then you say it and everybody is really impressed. That's right. It's the sermon on the Mount. Matthew chapters five through seven. And in the sermon on the Mount, the big question that Jesus is answering is, what is it you are doing? There's some rumors of miracles and a little inner circle of guys who are touring around with Jesus. There's some rumors of Jesus being descended from all the right people. There's even some weird rumors about his birth and that potentially being supernatural. Crazy stuff happened at his baptism. I heard that God and the Holy Spirit showed up. And then the rumor is that he went out in the desert and got tempted by the devil. There's all of this myth and lore and mist surrounding the early story of Jesus and the man, the legend, it's time to nail him down a little bit. What do you want? What do you hear to do? Over on the YouTube channel, I'm doing a video that comes out, I don't know, like today, tomorrow, something like that, about rival claimants to the title of Messiah at the time of Jesus. Well, spoiler alert for my video, there are tons. Josephus, the Jewish Roman first century historian, tells us in his book, The Antiquities of the Jews, that there were 10,000 uprisings. The way he describes it, it sounds like they all had messianic characteristics. So by the time Jesus is on the scene, people have had their fill of messiah stuff and they're going to need some specifics. So the occasion of the Sermon on the Mount is for Jesus to announce his program. Is he going to be another one of these militaristic guys who rallies people together, has some farmers get some pitchforks and torches, and we're going to go defeat the best army in the history of the world with trumpets and torches, like a bunch of these other clowns did? Well, you learn pretty quickly. Nope. The first thing he says in the Sermon on the Mount is that effectively the values of this kingdom that Jesus is here to initiate are the opposite of the values of the world that you all are here. And then he goes on to unpack the values of the kingdom, this picture of what the kingdom is, a picture of how the king behaves and how the king provides and what the king is going to do in the kingdom and what you need to do in the kingdom and how one gets into the kingdom and how important the kingdom is. So the Sermon on the Mount sets the whole thing up. Now we know what we're shooting at. Now we know who Jesus is. And the text tells us right at the end of chapter seven that Jesus taught like one who had authority, not like the teachers of the law at the time, said stuff. Well, then we go a couple of chapters where the question of Jesus authority is answered. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, he has the authority to make these kind of giant claims. He might actually even be able to back up the promise about this beautiful desirable kingdom that would scratch every itch. That's awesome. And then in chapter 10, we get the next big speech. This is the missional discourse of the great open world quest discourse where he sends out his disciples into the world with the ability to do some little miraculous stuff. Well, big miraculous stuff and he sends them out with a message repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And that's it. And he tells them, here's what it's going to be like in your initial trip right now. Here's what it's going to be like for you later on. Here's what it's going to be like for people who come after you when they go out to do this stuff down the road. And that's a pretty intimidating description of how all of this stuff is going to play out. Yet Jesus indicates it's very much worth it. So that also is occasional because that speech is given right before Jesus deploys people in his name for the first time ever. Then we fast forward a couple more chapters to chapter 13. And now at this point is so much more miraculous stuff has happened. Enemies of Jesus are starting to manifest and there's a new pregnant question. And the question is, how is this kingdom supposed to work? Because if there are no swords and we can't kill anybody to make it happen and we don't have any governmental power at all, and the people who are in charge seem to oppose it, and even people who seem miraculous stuff still don't always sign up. How's it going to work? Why isn't everybody signing up? And so the kingdom parables discourse of Matthew 13 answers a whole bunch of questions about how the kingdom of God is going to be. In fact, it's so direct in answering that question that almost every parable in that Matthew 13 discourse says the kingdom of heaven is like. And then it gives you one more detail about how the kingdom of heaven is going to be. Well, then we roll along through chapters 14, 15, 16, and 17 and we see the same pattern attack and retreat, ebb and flow. Jesus gets into the mix and the opposition is very strong, so strong that if he stays there, it's over. He's going to get killed. So then he pulls back and he goes and teaches the disciples, or he goes and he invests in outsiders, where he takes a big long road trip doing the other stuff and being out of the public eye for a little bit. All of that culminates with Peter being like, oh, yep, you are indeed the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God. And it culminates with Jesus being like, yeah, not only do I verbally affirm that that is true, but also here I am all dressed up like God. And you get to see some of my amazing, glowing glory. And then none of the disciples who see that can really argue that Peter's assessment is anything other than spot on. Jesus then says, hey, I'm going to die soon. You also need to know that. And then I'm going to be resurrected on the third day. And the disciples go through the phases of grief in chapters 16 and 17. And it looks like at the beginning of 18, they finally get to the final phase of grief, which is acceptance. And so it would seem that they are asking, okay, you're going to die. What's going to happen next? Now, the question is phrased in such a way in the text. Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? That it could be read as them just being arrogant jerks who want power, and maybe that's what was going on. But even if they were being arrogant jerks who wanted power and they weren't being faithful disciples who wondered where the mantle of Jesus authority would rest next, it still indicates that they are past grief and denial and bargaining. And they are into, okay, this is happening. We get it. So what's going to happen next? And that, my friends, is the occasion of Jesus' fourth great big speech around which the book of Matthew is structured. Matthew 18 gives us a discourse that sometimes is called the church life discourse or the Christian life discourse. There are a lot of names that this one is actually known by. I like the church life discourse a little bit better because that title acknowledges the occasion of the speech. The occasion of the speech is, hey, what happens next? Effectively, that's what the disciples ask. And Jesus effectively is going to say, well, you're going to need to live out the values of the kingdom in community. And this is part of what it looks like for a Christian to live out these relational values. So the first one is just the thing about the kiddos and about assuming a right posture before the king and then assuming a right posture toward those who've assumed a right posture. And that actually has a ton to do with where it goes next in terms of right relationships with each other. We've spent a lot of time on right relationships with God, with the values of the kingdom, with the structure, with the unfolding of the kingdom. And now we're talking about how this is going to work between one individual and another, or even more so, between one individual and a collection of other individuals who are also trying to assume a right posture before the king as sons, daughters, agents, heirs of this kingdom. And when we pick this up in verse seven tomorrow, we will see that despite the artificial after the fact divisions that you get in the Bible from the publishers, Jesus is actually still very much on the same thought, picking it up in verse seven from where we left off yesterday in verse six. To put a bow on all of this, Matthew 18 is refreshing because it's different than what we've been doing for the last few chapters. Last few chapters has been a lot of narrative structure. There's been a lot of big picture theology. I mean, confession of Christ. There's even been some historical theology, what a Catholics make of this, what a Protestants make of this and all of that stuff. I love doing it. I've loved this last stretch that we've worked through together, but this is a very well-paced document. And now we're getting into this stretch that is much more about the heart. It's much more about what we do with these values and with this stuff. And I think that whether you are a person like me who thinks is a God behind all of this, whether you're a person who would say I am or I want to be a child of the king, a member of this kingdom, a son, a daughter, an agent, an heir, whether you are that person or whether you're a person is like, I don't know. I just, I don't know what to make of it. Or I really don't believe this either way. I think that what we're about to get into in Matthew chapter 18 is going to get down to the personal stuff in ways that are beneficial to all of us and in ways that are redemptive and beautiful. So like I was saying at the beginning, there were times when my parents needed to sit us down and be like, here is what you need to do. Or here are some facts you need to know. And there were other times when before they walked out the door, they would spell out, here's what it looks like to get it right. Amongst you. And I feel like that's the stretch we're getting into here. And I think it's well timed and it's valuable. And it's already pushing me in ways that I like. I hope it has the same effect on you. I want to say thanks again to everybody who's decided to sponsor a child in Uganda through Africa renewal.org slash TmbH. We've been talking about that a lot. If you want to learn more about it, again, Africa renewal.org slash TmbH 40 bucks a month. Some of you decided to kick in and the stories keep coming. It's incredible what is already happening to change young people's lives in Uganda. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for doing that. I am honored that I get to partner with this group and try to help facilitate these connections. Thanks again for hanging out with me, my friends. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. You
