 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Jude. When I was a kid, if my brother or sister or I said literally anything, my parents, who were both music majors and did show tunes and stuff, would always come up with a song that connected to whatever we just said, and then they would start singing and everything. And as a kid, you're like, knock it off. Now I look back on it and I miss it. I liked when my mom and dad used to sing to me, inspired by literally anything I said. If you've ever known anybody who is a reference person, that is, if you bring up anything, they can come up with a quote from a movie or a book or a song or whatever, then you are going to feel tremendous familiarity with what is going on in the book of Jude, which pound for pound has got more references to other stuff than probably anything else in the Bible. It's unbelievable how many other things Jude references in what is effectively one page of texts. A teeny tiny little book of the Bible. It's a letter. It's written by Jude, who we know from a passage in Luke and a passage in Mark was one of the brothers of Jesus and like the other brothers of Jesus. They didn't really see it. Well, Jesus was alive and doing stuff, but after the resurrection, they came around and James, whose letter we looked at a few pages back and now Jude became significant leaders in the church. And as I mentioned a second ago, apparently this Jude fellow was someone who liked to dive deep into the Old Testament, but not just the Old Testament, also the peripheral books around the Old Testament, including some books that nobody ever even thought about considering canonical or part of the scriptures, but that really informed Jewish lore and Jewish thought and Jewish conversation and Jewish theology. And he freely draws on all of that stuff in this letter. Now we don't know what church that Jude is writing to, but it looks like something has gone off the rails and you're not going to believe what it was. It was false teachers again, and you're probably not going to believe this either, but they failed the threefold test for being Christians laid out by John a couple books earlier. They were greedy. They were sexually licentious, but the church is new and some of these churches fell for it and got thrown into confusion as a result. And just a quick side note here, by the way, false teaching is coming up and practically all of these books we're looking at here in the latter half of the New Testament. And I think it's kind of a compliment really to Christianity for how significant it very quickly became after the life and death and resurrection of Jesus because all these people want in. I mean, they don't want to follow Jesus, but they see that this is a big enough deal, that it's got enough momentum, that it's something that's worth messing with and worth exploiting for their own selfish gain. So that in and of itself, just by looking at the opposition to the church, it gives us a sense of how well and how quickly things have taken off with the followers of Jesus. This letter of Jude looks a lot like second Peter and I don't know who informed to, but pretty clearly, one or the other had seen and appreciated the effectiveness of the other letter. And so they embrace a very similar structure in terms of pointing to Old Testament examples, particularly of God judging those people who were leaders who resisted the message of God, resisted the messengers of God. And as was the case with second John and third John, I think the easiest way to give you a sense of the book is just to quickly read you the book. But let me remind you what we talked about earlier. There's a lot of references here. If you don't catch all of them or remember all of them, I think that's absolutely fine. We'll take a second to think about it after we get done reading it. Jude, a servant of Christ Jesus and a brother of James, to those who are the called, loved by God, the father and kept for Jesus Christ, may mercy, peace and love be multiplied to you. Dear friends, although I was eager to write you about the salvation we share, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was delivered to the saints once for all. For some people who were designated for this judgment long ago have come in by stealth, they're ungodly turning the grace of our God into sensuality and denying Jesus Christ, our only master and Lord. Now I want to remind you, although you came to know all these things once and for all, that Jesus saved a people out of Egypt and later destroyed those who did not believe and the angels who did not keep their own position but abandoned their proper dwelling, he has kept an eternal change and darkness for the judgment on the great day. Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns committed sexual immorality and perversions and serve as an example by undergoing the punishment of eternal fire. In the same way, these people relying on their dreams defile their flesh, reject authority and slander glorious ones. Yet when Michael, the archangel was disputing with the devil in an argument about Moses body, he didn't dare utter a slanderous condemnation against him, but said the Lord rebuke you. But these people blaspheme anything they don't understand and what they do understand by instinct, like irrational animals, by these things they're destroyed, woe to them for they've gone the way of Cain, they have plunged into Balaam's error for profit and they have perished in Cora's rebellion. These people are like blemishes at your love feasts as they eat with you without reverence. They're shepherds who only look after themselves, their waterless clouds carried along by winds, trees and laid autumn, fruitless, twice dead and uprooted, their wild waves of the sea foaming up their shameful deeds, wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever. It was about these that Enoch and the seventh generation from Adam prophesied. Look, the Lord comes with tens of thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly concerning all the ungodly acts they've done in an ungodly way and concerning all the harsh things ungodly sinners have said against him. These people are discontented grumblers living according to their desires, their mouths that are arrogant words, flattering people for their own advantage. But you, dear friends, remember what was predicted by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. They told you in the end times there will be scoffers living according to their own ungodly desires. These people create divisions and are worldly not having the spirit. But you, dear friends, as you build yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting expectantly for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life. Have mercy on those who waver, save others by snatching them from the fire, have mercy on others, but with fear, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh. Now to him who's able to protect you from stumbling and to make you stand in the presence of his glory without blemish and with great joy to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory, majesty, power and authority before all time, now and forever. Amen. I'm not sure I caught all the references in there, but by my count, there are 10 plus references to things in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. Did you hear he acknowledged the New Testament apostles as well? And it looks like there are three at least nods to stuff that is totally outside the Bible, two nods to the book of Enoch and then an allusion to this old text called the Assumption of Moses. All of these things would have been in circulation and popular at that time. And so Jude is drawing on all kinds of references and super loaded stories with very loaded cautionary tales that everybody in his audience would have resonated with immediately where you and I have to plow through it and work pretty hard to extract what each of those references was supposed to mean. Jude is one of those guys who knows his audience very well and is fluent in the references they would be fluent in, but the bottom line would seem to be there's a bunch of false teachers, their frauds, they're messing with you guys again. Avoid them entirely. God will judge them and be careful. This stuff does spread if you don't check it. So make sure you check it when you visualize the book of Jude picture Moses body, not because it necessarily tells the whole story of Jude, but because it's such a unique thing and it'll help you remember and recall stuff from the book of Jude. When you think about the theme reflect on how today's false teachers are cut from the same cloth as the false teachers of old and to resist them, Christian should build on the foundation of the gospel. And in terms of reading, it's another short one. So if you want to read it, you should have time to get through that pretty quickly. Jude leveled up next time around. We got revelation and that's the last book of the Bible. So that's pretty exciting. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
