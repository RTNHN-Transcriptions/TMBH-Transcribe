 Thank you everyone for taking the time to do this here. And we're going to speak to all of those questions. Let me start with a statement regarding what has happened in recent hours. As everyone is now painfully aware, we had an issue with the 10 minute Bible hour podcast back catalog over the previous few hours. During that time, listeners were unable to access any episodes of the podcast prior to the 100 most recently published episodes. We understand the inconvenience this has caused and our podcast hosting partner assures us that over the next several hours, the back catalog will become visible again on all podcasting apps. This has been a difficult day for all of us here. We thank you for your patience and at this time we will take questions. Yes. What services do you have? This is not going to happen again to your audience. Yeah, that's a great question. Libson.com has been an excellent partner as a podcast host for years and years. I anticipate a fruitful relationship with them moving forward, their communication and action plan was immediate. No one can guarantee that there might not be a problem with that again at some point. I would hope that any hypothetical future interruption of service could be resolved as neatly as this was. Yes, on the left. Second row. What role do you think the Russians might have played in this? At this time, we have no reason to suspect Russian interference. Do you believe that the Russians are following your podcast? We don't have any reason to believe that the podcast is currently on the radar of the Russian government or any government. You and I are confirmed to rumors that this was a false flag meant to just give you free publicity. I can deny that. I was unaware of the service issues and the outage at any point. And as quickly as possible, we sought to resolve it. Obviously, I've got a lot of egg on my face right now. And though the old mantra goes that all publicity is good publicity, I certainly don't feel that right now standing here with all of you. This has been a very difficult day. Yes, left front row. Matt, obviously this is a great day of humiliation and abject shame for you in the 10 minute body lower. How much do you despise yourself right now? Well, I mean, as I said earlier in our conversation here, it hasn't been an easy day. We've obviously got a few internal things that we're going to look at closely in terms of what we would do in response to a situation like this in the future. But it would seem that there is just an honest internal mistake that happened at our hosting partner company. And it's been resolved quickly. I wouldn't say that I feel any more degree of disdain for myself than hopefully a normal healthy attitude of self-criticism that I carry with me throughout my life so that I stay honest with myself. Does that answer your question? This has an impact at your marriage. At this point, it has not impacted my marriage. Camille and I are very happy and we enjoy our role as spouses and as parents. What about your extended family? This is the kind of humiliating public blunder that can stain a family legacy forever. Have they contacted you? Have you been in touch with them today? No, I haven't spoken with my mom or my dad or any members of my extended family. I'm not sure that they even noticed. I know that my mom sometimes listens to the podcast. I'm not sure anyone else in my family necessarily does. So probably for them, it just came and went. So I can't imagine that there's anything wrong with my otherwise very healthy relationship with my parents or my family. I think things are great there. Thank you. I'm going to move on from that line of questioning. Last question. Yes, sir in the back. Matt, how has this affected your faith? Do you still believe that there's a God? Yeah, I do. And I understand where your question is coming from. My back catalog on my podcast was offline for several hours. That's the kind of thing that is going to rattle a person understandably. But no, no, not to that level. I continue to believe there is a God. I don't feel betrayed or let down by him over this. And I intend to move forward as a Christian. At this time, I think it's best to draw this to a close. I want to say thank you again to our listeners for your great patience during this trying time. I want to say thank you to the members of the press who came to speak to this obviously sensitive situation. And again, I want to reassure everyone who enjoys listening to the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast that the situation is being addressed and that the entirety of the episodes will be listenable again either now or in the very, very near future. We apologize again for the inconvenience. I'm sorry, no more questions at this time. Thank you. God bless. Thank you.
