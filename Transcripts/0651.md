 Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and we've got a thing as a family that we do for all the holidays. Like a little rhythm, a little deal like not all the holidays, but all the big ones. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, there's stuff that we eat. There are things that we do that are unique and private to our family, but then there are also things that we do. They're pretty much in keeping with what everybody and Arnak of the Woods does. You just got these rhythms and you know the rhythms of the holiday and it might be difficult looking back on that from thousands of years in the future to understand what we're talking about if we were just casually communicating about it because I don't know, a holiday isn't just a neat, tidy, like one day thing. Christmas is kind of like a it's a whole weekend. It's a whole season. It's a whole event. It's not one meal. It's not one opening of gifts. It's not one church service. It's pretty grand. And in the midst of the holiday seasons and all the buffer days that come and go on either side and all the rhythms of all of that, you've also got certain preparations that have to happen. And maybe you're the kind of person who's a part of that. Maybe you're the kind of person who sits back and other people in your family kind of make that stuff go. But I mean, there's a reasonable amount of fretting in any family that takes holidays seriously, I suppose. You got to get the right kind of food for the right kind of thing. You have certain decorations that you put out. You have certain things that you think about. You have certain ways that you show appreciation and care to other people in your lives that you got to do. If church is part of the rhythm of all that, you got to figure out how it fits and how the travel works and where everybody's going to stay and how you're going to get through the difficult relational things from the last time you all got together and who's going to be the person who provides the social buffering. We all completely get this about our own holiday rhythm, which I think is way less somber, serious and set in stone than the holiday rhythm that we're talking about when we look for a century in Jesus part of the world and in his culture. There's a way you did the holidays. There's a way you did Passover. There's a way you did unleavened bread and there's a certain rhythm to it and there's certain places where it's supposed to happen. For example, the Passover, if you're really celebrating it right, it needs to happen inside the boundaries of Jerusalem, not just near Jerusalem. And ideally, you want to get a lamb that has been properly religiously prepared at the temple. We call this feast that is happening in the passage that we're looking at in Matthew chapter 26 surrounding all the stuff that goes on. Jesus crucifixion and resurrection. The larger festival here is the festival or the feast of unleavened bread, but it's a part of this very, very holy thing that is the Passover. We have talked about all of this before, but this one verse that we're going to look at today, I think is best considered in light of all that stuff. I'm saying about how we think about holidays and the rhythms and some of the things that are really, really important to us that maybe we might not seem important to outsiders. Keep all that in the back of your brain. Listen to this. Matthew 26 17 on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover? We're going to get to his response next time around. But first, again, we have a relationship here between two holidays, unleavened bread and Passover. Unleavened bread has to do with getting all of the yeas, all of the yeas to drizzen bread that is out of your house. And there's a certain meal with certain rhythms that goes along with this. And it's pretty elaborate. I suppose we could do a bunch of episodes on that, but there's so much stuff around the internet of people reproducing this meal as it would have been. I'd encourage you to go and look at any of that. It's very, very interesting and loaded with symbolism. But then the other holiday that's in play here and they're related to each other is the Passover and the Passover, of course, is a reference back to the last plague in Egypt when the angel of death went around and the killing of the Hebrew sons at the hands of the Egyptians boomeranged back on them by God finally pushing Pharaoh in the Egyptians over the edge through this series of plagues. The final one being that, hey, you know, you took the Hebrew sons now. It's the Egyptian sons who will perish in the same way. Those twists of literary irony are very important in the Old Testament in many ways is structured around such narrative twists. Well, then the idea of this feast is that you got to have a lamb because the lamb was sacrificed and you put the blood on the doorposts and that tells the angel of death to pass over the house of the people who believed in God and did what they were supposed to do with the blood on the doorposts and the lamb. It's not difficult to see the connection there between John's exclamation when he sees Jesus early in Jesus' public life and he's like, whoa, behold, the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. That sounds exactly like Passover. And then another part of the deal was that you needed to get a collection of a certain group of bitter roots or herbs that you were supposed to consume as a part of this meal. And I think it's in the Bible. I don't think this is just tradition. You know what? I couldn't tell you for sure where. Maybe this is in the Bible. Maybe it's tradition. I don't know. And we try not to edit out the parts where I just don't know things. Hey, now you know that I don't know if this is a tradition or Bible. But I think the idea one way or another of eating these roots was to remind you of how bitter it was to be enslaved by the Egyptians. And so in the same way that throughout the Old Testament, every time there's a covenant renewal that is a renewal of God's deal with his chosen people or some kind of reminder of God's character, there's always this reference back to the one true God, the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of Moses who led you out of slavery delivered you from slavery in Egypt. And the idea is that that event alone should be enough to permanently tether the descendants of Abraham, the Jewish, Hebrew, Israelite people to their one true God because look at this singular demonstration of power. Now in reality, there are a Jillian more demonstrations of that God's power throughout the Old Testament. But for remembering the character of God, that seems to be the one they always point back to. So Passover then is in keeping with this. It annualizes it institutionalizes this built in hardcore, take it very seriously cultural reminder that the God of our forefathers is the same God who is with us still the God who saw us through the oppression under the brutal yoke of the Egyptians is the same God who is here seeing us through the oppression under the maybe not quite as brutal yoke of the Romans. It would get brutal or later. And so this meal doubled as cool family get together, go to the big city, hang out holiday time. And also incredibly meaningful shared story. Everybody leans into the story and remembers that they are a part of a story that is much bigger than themselves. Theological reality shaping event that is built into every single year so that this understanding remains front and center. But remember back in Matthew 5 17, Jesus starts talking publicly for the first time. Then as people are hearing about how great this sounds, the beginning of this Herman on the Mount, no doubt they're like, ah, it's amazing. But we kind of already have a religion and I don't know what do we do with all the stuff that we already have because we live those stories. And then Jesus says what is perhaps the pivotal verse of all of the book of Matthew Theologically, Matthew 5 17 don't think I've come to abolish the law in the prophets. I haven't come to abolish them but to fulfill them. So he sets the whole thing on that trajectory. That's the thesis statement right there from Jesus about what his life is going to be. And so he's the completion of all of these stories. He's the completion of the blood being on the door posts at the top and the sides. It's a cross behold the Lamb of God who takes the way the sins of the world. He fits with the story. He solves the story. He resolves the note. He completes the character arc. He completes the narrative arc. He completes the musical movement. And so the attentive original audience reader would have been like, okay, well, wow, we're really headed for quite the event here with Passover and the collision course between Jesus and the religious leaders happening all at once. This festival is a reminder of the blood that was shed to save God's chosen people. Jesus is setting himself up as though his blood is what is going to be shed to save God's people. The Feast of Unleavened Bread and the Passover are this vital moment, this vital reminder for keeping together God's chosen people, his family of faith. But Jesus is here building a new family of faith that seems to even transcend that would make sense that there would be some sort of culminating event around unleavened bread and Passover for that family of faith reason as well. This feast is a big deal on a national level. It's a big deal on a historical level. It's a big deal on a narrative level for the ebbs and flows of the book of Matthew. And it's a gigantic deal on a personal level between Jesus and his disciples. It's a narratively important and also a very human understandable relatable moment, especially for the original audience of the disciples. They're just rolling along with things here and they're like, all right, well, we need to do this meal, right? What should we do? And so just like at some point, you have to put thought into the rhythms of your holiday and actually putting attention into the details and getting things set up so they inquire of Jesus about the same thing. And we'll see if he had any opinions about it next time around. Side note, I read your reviews and I really appreciate them. Thank you for putting those on multiple platforms and for vouching for me, which is an unbelievable honor and for effectively inviting other people to be apart because that's what those reviews do. So thanks. I see that. I super appreciate it. I appreciate all you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
