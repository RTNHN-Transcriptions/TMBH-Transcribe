 Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 1 Peter. You remember Peter? We have not seen him forever. He gets mentioned a couple of times in Paul's letters, I think. But other than that, it's really the middle of the book of Acts that is the last time we see him doing stuff. And we leave off with Peter in kind of an interesting place. You'll recall he was the disciple who was loud and brash and bold around Jesus. He was always saying what everybody was thinking, but the only one willing to take the risk. And as a result, he got to participate in amazing things. He also got to look super stupid at times. And the book of Matthew ends with him saying, I'm never going to leave you. Never. How totally be faithful to you. Totally forever. You can completely count on me. I'll never let you down. And then within like half a page, he denies Jesus three times and runs away in Jesus' greatest moment of need. Crying into the night, and we don't hear from him again in the entire book of Matthew. The very last bit of stuff that we get in the Gospels at the very, very, very end of the book of John includes details about the resurrected Jesus restoring Peter. And in the same way that Peter denied Christ three times, three times Jesus tells Peter to take care of his sheep to take care of the people who are going to follow Jesus. And to Peter's credit, it looks like he does that. It looks like he goes through a massive maturation process. And early in the book of Acts, we see him being like, whoa, God's doing something here. The Holy Spirit has arrived. I should say something. What would Jesus do? What would Jesus do? Oh, I know. Because one of the last things he remembered Jesus doing was looking back through all of the Old Testament and pointing out how all of it pointed toward him. So Peter's the guy who gets up at the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter two. And it's like, all right, here is some stuff from the Old Testament. And look, all of this is from God. And it was always pointing to Jesus. And it's like we can almost see him getting his footing there in the first half of the book of Acts. And in those first several chapters, we see Peter finally followed through on what he said he was going to do when he was making big bold promises to Jesus back on the night he got arrested. He actually does take the beatings and the abuse on behalf of Jesus. And we know that eventually he dies as a martyr tradition says that he got crucified upside down at the site of Nero's horse racing track across the Tiber River on the outskirts of Rome in a place that is now the Vatican where St. Peter's Basilica sits. So this guy casts a very long shadow over the early church and the rest of Christian history. He's a gigantic deal. But part of the reason that he's so beloved is because he's so human. The guy is trying and he's taken big swings and it doesn't always work out exactly right. And he even goes on to make more stupid mistakes after the book of Acts and given into peer pressure and showing a little bit of favoritism, like getting wrong exactly what James in the previous book said Christians need to get right. So like us, the guy wasn't perfect, but perhaps all the more so because of that, he was well positioned to encourage Christians of all different stripes and all around the Roman world right up until the time that he was martyred probably in the late 60s AD. Well, the occasion of this letter is that Peter's got word about the difficulties that are going on for Gentile Christians in particular in Asia Minor, which is a very pro-Roman part of the world at this time. And Peter can very much empathize with what it's like to be a Christian in that context because he's writing from a pretty pro-Roman place himself, that being Rome, well, he takes a really interesting tack in encouraging these Gentile believers toward godliness and faithfulness and remaining in Christ. He uses a whole bunch of images and stories and theological language from the Old Testament and uses it inclusively to be like, no, this is all your story. I know ethnically you guys are Gentiles or whatever, but in Christ, this is your story too. The ups and the downs, the good and the bad, the ugly of it all. And finally, that was something Peter could relate to neatly as well. And in using a bunch of these images, he's saying that you guys are the real deal. You're completely in and like God's chosen people of the past, you as members of this new family of faith, you're set apart from the rest of the world as well. So if you feel like outsiders, Peter seems to be reasoning. That would just make sense. If you suffer, Peter seems to be reasoning. That would make sense. If you're not going to be outsiders, you're not going to fit. You're part of this much larger historical story of God working with the group of people toward his redemptive ends and you all have roles in this kingdom. You matter. You count. But then he goes on to say that in order for you all to play these roles, you got to stand strong in the face of this spiritual opposition. It feels like physical opposition, but Peter develops the theme, especially in the closing lines of this letter much like what Paul said at the end of the book of Ephesians. You're not really fighting against flesh and blood. I know it feels like it when somebody made of flesh and blood is whooping on you and your flesh and blood is in pain. But the truer reality is that you're fighting against spiritual darkness that is much bigger than any of the political things or physical things that are going on. So in order then to be able to do what you're supposed to do and to play the role that you need to play and to be a part of this holy people set apart for God, you got to keep striving toward maturity. You have to like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk so that by it you can grow up in your salvation. And then he moves on to there to hit it even harder in the same tone and the same line of thought that James was taking in his letter. He hits the theme even harder that the suffering you guys are going through. It has a purpose. God is going to use that to accomplish things, to prepare you, to communicate truths about himself, to the people around you who right now seem really hostile to you, but they are watching. So be faithful in difficult situations. And Peter says, if you take a beating, like I get it. It's not just. It's not right. And there will be justice for that eventually. But in the meantime, if you take a beating, if you take abuse, make sure it is because you are a part of the world. Because you are a part of this holy set apart people who like newborn babies of craved spiritual milk and you've grown up in your salvation and you've set aside all of the ugly stuff like malice and deceit and hypocrisy and envy and slander of every kind. All the stupid stuff. If you take abuse, make sure it's because you are living for Christ and don't take abuse because your agitators or busy bodies or loud mouths or disruptive or stupid. And in keeping with that theme, that really shrewd strategy that Peter is advancing, he says that even in your households, there may be injustice. In fact, he knows there is injustice and you may have to endure that injustice for a time. But even if you are a bond servant or a slave or even a child in a difficult household run by people who are hostile toward you, really the truth is you are well positioned to model the humility of Christ and the truth of the God. And the truth of the gospel to the people around you, even in those difficult circumstances, which again, there will be justice for. And as we get to the end of the letter, we're getting the clear sense that there is uniformity among the big names in the New Testament in Christian thought as to what the strategy is going to be for existing as the new family of faith, existing as a spiritual kingdom within this worldly kingdom that is Rome and that is very hostile toward you. And the strategy is not to take up the sword, but it's to put down the sword. And if need be, endure indignity and abuses, surely no one will endure more injustice than Christ, who was righteous, pure in every way, and yet still was subjected to death, even humbled himself to death on a cross. So the strategy isn't let's blow up Rome, let's detonate all of its social structures, let's take over the government, let's win on the military front, let's win a culture war. And look, I know there are people who make the case that maybe the strategy needs to be different to different points in history. That's a conversation for another day. But what we can clearly say here is that Jesus, Paul, Peter, even going all the way back to Jeremiah and the prophetic council that he gave the exiles as they were about to be taken away to Babylon, they're all coming from the same direction. Be people of peace, be people who build up your community, be people who show care for those who are in need, live upright lives. If you get persecuted, let it be because you were living upright lives for Christ. And don't let it be because you were into mischief and slander and gossip and being duplicitous. That seems to be the plan that is prescribed really from Jeremiah on in the Bible for what to do while you are in either living in the Bible. You are in either literal or metaphorical exile. And I think Jeremiah, Jesus, Paul and Peter are all very vindicated in that because Christianity on paper had no business working out. It shouldn't have happened. The cultural forces that were in place were so massive and so overwhelming. There was no room for some new upstart ideology to come out of nowhere and unify the world under its banner. Yet it did. I think that is first and foremost due to the fact that Jesus was real and his resurrection was real. But further, I think it's because the example of Christ and the values of his kingdom were imparted to Christians through his Holy Spirit. And they did stuff that was totally counter-cultural and pointed people to Jesus in over the next few centuries. That one out with no need for any swords, any weapons, any political force whatsoever. But finally, let's go back and revisit that word that we were just using a second ago, exile. At the very end of the book, Peter says that he's writing this thing from Babylon. Well, Peter's not in Babylon. We have all kinds of details to tell us that Peter's totally on the other side of the world. He's in Rome. What does he mean by that? Well, Babylon was a metaphor that Peter and others employed when talking about Rome in this era. Why? Well, maybe it was just coded language so they could sneak letters in and out without seeming like they were subverting Roman authority or Roman culture. I think there's a decent chance that that was part of it. I mean, Peter's writing a letter here saying don't go around stirring up trouble and being troublemakers, and unsophisticated, overly ambitious Roman law enforcement agent might get their hands on that letter and be like, what? I think I see subversion right here. But more than being sneaky, I think using Babylon as a code word for Rome is a way to remind all of these Christians that they are indeed, once again, a part of the Old Testament story. And the part of the story they find themselves in is a new exile. They're outsiders in a land that is hostile toward them and their values and their God. And they've got to figure out for the time being, maybe for a very long time, what it looks like to live as followers of God in the world. And the words of God in this hostile environment where there are spiritual forces of evil arrayed against them, undergirding the resistance they feel on a daily basis. So I don't think Peter's using the word Babylon at the end of this letter and it's just some kind of cheap throw away. I think it's the final evolution of his thought to say, you are a part of this ongoing story of faith. You are a part of us. This story is your story. You are the real deal and part of being the real deal right now means that you get to join us in experiencing what exile is like. But be faithful in that. God is with us. When you visualize a book of 1 Peter, picture Roman Babylon just jumbled together the imagery from those two places in your brain. When you think about the theme, reflect on how Peter is saying that Christians are exiles and God is using those exiles in a foreign place to build his kingdom and bring glory to himself so remain faithful. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, catch chapter 1 and chapter 5. First Peter leveled up and where there is a first Peter, there's probably going to be a second Peter. And indeed, there is. And that's what we're going to cover next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
