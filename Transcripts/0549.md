 Hey everybody, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we ain't done talking about the word generation yet. And I decided to take yesterday and today off so I could go bum around with my family a bit, which has been delightful. And Aaron is doing a magnificent job of thinking through this thing so that we can move ahead with an understanding of what generation means and how that works throughout the book of Matthew. So I'm just going to bounce it to him and let him pick up right where he left off. Catch you soon. Hey everybody, I'm Aaron Filanin from Matt again today. We are still talking about this idea of generation. Matthew really likes this word and this idea and it's an important concept throughout his gospel. He uses the term, the actual word, 13 different times throughout his gospel. In chapter one, he's referring to what we might think of as the typical use of generation. He's talking about family line and life spans and those kinds of things. However, in the rest of the gospel, it functions very differently. And as we talked about yesterday, these words fall into a context. They're not like a dorander and lyric where it's the word salad and everything's kind of thrown together. It all falls into a context. So if I say the word trunk and we're walking down the circus, you can imagine I'm talking about elephants versus if I talk about a little boy riding his bike in my neighborhood and mention a trunk, you can assume that he crashed his new bike. We all do this every day. The words have meaning and we can determine that based on their context. We do this really quickly and really subconsciously and the context helps us supply how the word is being used and that focuses its meaning. And so we read each of the verses in Matthew's gospel where he uses the word generation and we notice some patterns. First of all, outside of chapter one, in each of those uses, the word generation has absolutely no mention of any temporal aspect or any kind of family tree or family line. So there's the usual use of the word is missing in all nine of those contexts. Secondly, in each of those uses, it's always negative. He's talking about this generation and a pejorative sense or he's talking about an evil generation or an adulterous generation, twisted and wicked generation, really, really strong language. So whatever Matthew is meaning and whatever Jesus is meaning quoted in Matthew's gospel, rather, it's not good. He's referring to a class of people. So I want to jump off there today and go just a little bit further and look at a couple other scriptures where the word is used in a very similar aspect. And I think that that'll round out the picture for us of how Jesus is intending to use the word here in Matthew's gospel and what that really means for us. Let me read for you Jesus in Luke chapter 16 verse eight. He's talking about the parable of the dishonest manager where the manager actually tricks his master to forgive dad and Jesus flips the whole thing on its head and he says, well, the master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness for the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. So that parable is worthy of a lot of words in itself. But the thing I want to note here is the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. Now what's implied there, but not quite explicitly stated is the sons of this world and the sons of light each have their own generation. They're two different classes of people living intermingled and concurrent with one another. Peter in his speech at Pentecost picks up on the same idea and wrapping up his sermon there and inviting people to come to Jesus as the Messiah. He says this. And with many other words, he bore witness and continued to exhort them saying, Savior selves from this crooked generation. And again, Peter is making the invitation. There is a current generation. It's crooked in the same way that Jesus used it. It's evil. It's contrary to following Christ as the Messiah. And Peter says, save yourself from this crooked generation. In other words, there's an invitation. You don't have to be a part of this generation. Paul says something similar in his letter to Philippians chapter 2 verse 15. I pray that you may be blameless and innocent, he says, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world. So the point is this. Jesus is using this word generation. Matthew's quoted it nine different times, all in the same context with the same meaning. It's a negative. You do not want to be a part of this generation and judgment is going to fall upon this generation. However, in all of those, there is no mention of a family line. There's no mention of a timestamp like we talked about like the baby boom or generation X. You cannot pinned into this present and evil generation. If it was a race of people or a family line or an era of time, there would be no sense making an invitation to come out of this generation, to not live among this generation. You can't change where and how and when you live. So the invitation is to just not be a part of it. So Jesus is making this invitation. Paul Peter are making this invitation. And so here's really the big lesson to draw. Because the word generation is not referring to a family line or an era of time, the invitation is you don't have to be a part of it. And Jesus is doing that here. Jesus is giving them warning after warning after warning all throughout his gospel. He's contrasting the people who are faithful and come to follow him with this present, crooked, evil, adulterous generation. He's contrasting that. And then he comes to these seven woes against the Pharisees in Matthew 23 at the end of the gospel. And the implication is this is a warning all throughout scripture. Prophetic warnings are given even though they're announced as impending judgment. The whole reason to announce the judgment is so that people might turn and be healed. It would be useless to make such an appeal if the word generation functioned in its more normal literal sense in terms of a family line or a time stamped generation. The word is functioning a little more metaphorically. It's a spiritual era. By that means the people that Jesus is talking to and anybody reading Matthew's gospel today has the option to decide, I don't really want to be a part of that generation. And you can hear Jesus' heart in this. As he wraps up Matthew 23, he gives these seven woes which are really, really scathing. But he wraps it up as we'll look at tomorrow as we round out Matthew 23. His tone even in that isn't one of anger. Now I'm glad you guys are all going to get your due. It's one of lament. Even now as Jesus pronounces these woes on this generation, this spiritual class of people, there's a sense that he still wishes it could be different. And in fact, if we were to follow the line of thinking throughout the rest of the New Testament, that's exactly where Peter goes. And he stands up in Jerusalem to speak at Pentecost. He's saying the exact same thing and he's using the exact same word. Save yourselves from this crooked generation. So Jesus' heart, even in announcing judgment, shines through and giving them an opportunity to turn from that. So that's how Matthew is using the word generation as I see it. And that's where the story is heading as we pick up the last paragraph of chapter 23 tomorrow. Matt will be back with that. I really appreciate you sitting in with me as I've filled in. It's a treat to get to do this. I really hope I get to do what you get to.
