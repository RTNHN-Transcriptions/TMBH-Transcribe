 everybody is matt this is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast and i think i told you a little bit a while back about the time when i was a kid and we went up to wyoming to visit my grandparents and there's a neighbor kid across the street there from their church seem like a nice enough lad so we hang out play gi jos or the transformers board games i don't know what every kids did and in the process of that i brought up that i'd been to the local ben franklin store and i saw there in the toy department that they had a gi joe character that i wanted for two ninety nine well i didn't have two ninety nine that's a lot of money back then especially when you were a kid so i was collecting cans i was asking if he had any cans that i could go and recycle he's like man don't do that i got a lot of money here for example i have a five dollar bill you know what just take it go buy that gi joe guy you want i was like i don't think my parents would like it very much he took any stuff in my pocket he was like no there you go and you kind of padded it there you go take that and this went on for a little while back and forth back and forth and finally i became convinced that it'd be fine i took the five dollar bill i told my parents they were like okay whatever i bought the gi joe guy and we went home to colorado thinking nothing of it couple weeks go buy phone rings i get called into mom and dad's bedroom and it's the family of this young man and apparently they'd asked him where's that five bucks and he's like i don't want to wow that's a huge mystery i don't know you got me you know the only person who's really been down there was a scoundrel matt Whitman from colorado and without any critical thought or questioning whatsoever they just called my parents were like uh i think something happened here and we'd like our five dollars back and i was like hardcore denial and they know that's not what happened i told you what happened when it happened that is not true i even got the kid on the phone and walked him through pace by pace in front of all four parents exactly what happened like you are lying and you know you are lying and he's like mmm i'm so sorry to have to do this to you but the truth is so important and it's like oh my goodness it's so frustrating because i'm definitely telling the truth but he's doing the i'm definitely telling the truth thing except he wasn't and i'm telling you he was lying now here's what i'm gonna do to just vouch for this a little bit stronger there's a situation a year before this where i totally did lie i did damage just got bored and did damage to this really nice sweatshirt that my mom saved up and bought me because we didn't have a lot of money and i got it as a gift and i don't know why i did it like i just just bored i guess at school i damaged it and i knew i was going to be in trouble and when i got asked i blamed other kids and then the right questions got asked and i was embarrassed and i had to admit that i did it so look i'm not saying i'm above the lie i did it once too but this kid was lying this time and i wasn't but it occurred to me in that moment this is a stalemate there's nothing i can do to fix this there were only two of us down there and how i came to acquire the five dollar bill is something that could only be attested to one of two ways i took it or it was given to me that was it two people are doing different ways but you know what would change to everything is if like i don't know if the kid had a brother or not but let's say he had a brother and his brother's name was wallie and he came in there and he was like what are you guys doing in here and then the one kid was like i got this five dollars i'm going to give it to matt here so we can buy a gi-joe guy and wallie was like okay that seems inconsequential noted and then later wallie came into the fray and was like hey no that five dollars was a gift that would solve everything right because you want something to break the log jam well this is not a new problem it's just one that hadn't occurred to me until fifth or sixth grade whenever this was this problem though goes back to like forever ages past and if you go and look at almost any ancient society that took me three minutes and fifty seconds and i'm not apologizing if you go back and look at any ancient society you will see that they had to have some kind of set of rules for what accounts for truth what makes a thing real because i'm like science where you can go and just test a thing again and again to see if you can duplicate the results which oftentimes you can't but theoretically you can duplicate true results as many times as you need to to prove something in the physical world history is not repeatable and therefore you go with evidence like okay who is where what happened fingerprints footprint stuff like that but mostly witnesses and if you can get more than one witness according to pretty much every set of rules in the ancient world that would be enough to be like all right look we got a problem here well there's a problem going on for the religious leadership in Matthew chapter 26 and the problem is Jesus is very likable and people don't seem to want to destroy him because of how he i don't know makes it so their legs work again and can make giant pales of fish appear to feed people who are hungry and really wanted a pale of fish he brings some dead people back to life and makes grieving mothers feel better about that because now their kid isn't dead anymore and not like undead like fine things are just great he can heal people from a distance he says things that make sense in terms of grand theological perspective but also all of those values that he's talking about they're appealing and everybody's like that actually kind of sounds like what we want i mean all the wind is in the sales of Jesus and when he rolls into town like five chapters earlier people are coming out with you know paul branches and stuff waving them around and being like the hosanna this is like this is the son of david this is what we've been looking forward to kids are yelling stuff about him being the son of david and saying hosanna and all of that and jesus is like oh it's in the bible like yeah from the lips of children this kind of yeah it's true what are you going to do jesus even flipped over a bunch of tables and people still liked him jesus told off the religious leadership in front of everybody and people still liked him he smacked of something that was truer and realer and better and he didn't tell lies so he didn't have to remember which lie he told last time to keep it straight to make sure he'd nail it the next time he just said things that were brave and true and i don't even mean like he just didn't say things that were false objectively like i stole the five dollars versus i was given the five dollars no i mean he just told the straight up truth look at a thing say what the thing is don't be afraid of power don't be afraid of the people who are going to be angry that you said a true thing and both despite of and because of all of that integrity even though he probably did offend a ton of people the religious leadership was having trouble getting two witnesses to vouch you just needed two according to the law that was laid out back in the book of dune oronomy to establish at least the beginnings of someone's guilt and it's not like this was a new project for them they've been probing around for something to bring forward witnesses about since the beginning of the time that they started to have a problem with him this is clearly a playbook they have used in the past this obnoxious constitutional technicality fourth amendment warrant kind of businesses here this due process silliness and so they got to get the witnesses and they got to get them warmed up and so they're trying to get jesus to say things in front of people so that the witnesses can be not them for example matthew nine right at the beginning of it jesus stepped into a boat crossed over and came to his own town some man brought to him a paralytic lying on a mat when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic take heart son your sins are forgiven but at this some of the teachers of the law said to themselves this fellow is blaspheming but it doesn't work for them to bring the charge they have to have other people say it the same way maybe you've been caught in a gossip circle at some point i know i have and you start to spiral into that real dark plotting place and you're like i see how stupid and bad this thing and can nobody see how crazy and awful things are around here i mean i'm not gonna say it but man somebody needs to say something or do something and you find yourself kind of wishing that somebody else would see the thing and do something hopefully you don't act on it you just dwell in that dark place for a minute then come to your senses and become an adult and get on with things but we all know what it's like to face that temptation it just looks like the Pharisees give into that temptation matthew chapter 12 the Pharisees are being more overt in what they're going for here going on from that place verse nine he went into the synagogue and a man with a shriveled hand was there looking for a reason to accuse jesus they asked him is it lawful to heal on the sabbath well there's a lot of people there to synagogue if jesus gives a bad answer here i mean it would be by his own words that he's condemned the Pharisees wouldn't even have to say anything some useful idiot would hear it and with a heavy heart just have to report to some sort of trial like the one we're getting in the middle of the night in matthew 26 someday down the road they just have to rat out jesus just as a matter of personal integrity but jesus doesn't say anything that you can burn him down for later in that same chapter they're trying to get jesus to do tricks for them so that he'll maybe do the wrong one they're also trying to suggest that he's in league with beelzebub maybe hoping somebody will see all of that happen and be like look those tricks that he just did remember a minute ago when we said that he's in league with beelzebub i wonder where those tricks came from it would take a very wise person to sort that out surely someone much wiser than us but if any of you had any opinions you could come and share those later at a future trial that we will need to conduct to see him arrested and executed. Matthew 16 verse 1 the Pharisees and Sadducees came to jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven same tricks they were playing back in chapter 12 but you'll notice that it is a test they're trying to dupe him into doing something the wrong way then matthew 19 some Pharisees came to him to test him they is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason clever like half the people held one opinion at that time half the people held another is asking us questions like this in front of all kinds of people surely half the people in the room are going to hate whatever jesus says and be so offended that their idea got criticized to the same way a college football fan gets offended when the announcer on their game seems to like the one team better than the other oh that stirs some passions well jesus gives the answer in such a way that it's still hard to find a witness who wants to come and burn him down then we get into the stuff in chapter 21 and 22 all of these tests that are getting thrown at jesus what about taxes what about authority what about if a guy dies and then his brother asked to marry the widow and then he dies and then he dies and then he dies and then he dies what about that to who would he be married to then in heaven think about that they're throwing anything at the wall that they can to get him to say something that will make someone mad enough that they would run right to the edges of what is true to say some stuff to get jesus in trouble they just need to dig up two jilted people who maybe heard something from somebody else who heard it from somebody else and maybe they were kind of there and maybe their integrity is just a little bit sloshee but they're still very righteously indignant that's all it's going to take and then they'll have their two witnesses under cover of darkness. Matthew 2657 those would arrested jesus took him to kayethis the high priest where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled and then peter's following behind verse 59 the chief priests and the whole sand hedon were looking for false evidence against jesus so they could put him to death but they didn't find any though many false witnesses came forward finally two came forward and declared this fella said i'm able to destroy the temple of god and rebuild it in three days and that one sounded just truthy enough to move the needle and cause the sand hedon to feel like okay those are charges we could trot out there i would have loved to have had a second witness over the five dollar gijo guy incident from my childhood it would have sorted everything out and i would have been vindicated but that's kind of a double-edged sword because even in that case if the other witness had chosen to lie as well then it would have gone down forever as though i was guilty of a thing that i really wasn't guilty of in that situation likewise here the people who are supposed to be in charge of virtue and goodness are weaponizing that to flip around and pervert the notion of reliable witnesses to get jesus on words he didn't actually say more on this manyana i'm matt is the ten-minute bible hour podcast let's do this again soon you
