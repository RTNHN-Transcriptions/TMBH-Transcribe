 Hey, my friends, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. And you know what's a horrible thing to go through is divorce. I have never gone through one of these. My parents have not gone through one of these. My in-laws have not gone through one of these. But man, a whole lot of people I love have had their lives touched by that. And it is a subject that comes up in the text that we're going to look at today. I'm guessing that some of you listening to this right now have walked through something like this, not just in your life, but recently. And it hurts and it's brutal. And as I try to have a conversation about this text that is light and useful and clips right along and is fun, I don't want you to think for a minute that I think this is a trite subject. It's a tremendously serious subject. That's the brutal thing to walk through. So if that's something you've gone through and you are divorced and now single, or if that's something you've gone through and you are divorced and now remarried, either way, grace and peace to you, my friend. I'm sorry from one person who has a heart that can be hurt to another person who has a heart that can be hurt that that's something that you've had to walk through. That said, what you and I have agreed to, tacitly, I suppose, in doing this thing together, going through the Book of Matthew, is that we're going to do all of it. The beauty of going all the way through a Book of the Bible like this is it eliminates my preference biases. I would prefer not to tackle passages that are easily mishandled and that draw fresh memories from wounds that maybe aren't fully healed. But when we do it this way, we've committed ourselves to whatever is next is whatever is next. And so what's next is Jesus getting confronted by the religious leaders again on a very difficult question. So we're seeing this narrative ebb and flow that has been repeating all through the middle part of the Book of Matthew. Jesus says beautiful things, paints a picture of how things are, invests in his disciples, and then he comes out of the transcendent and back into the crass, real world problems, where he is continually met by opposition from the religious leaders who, I mean, let's be honest, their weapon of choice is nitpicky rules and whether or not Jesus is going to get himself into trouble by not navigating the nitpicky rules just the right way verbally. Because I mean, we've seen for chapters now that their ambition is to destroy him to defeat him to even see him killed. So it is narratively no surprise that after Matthew 19 opens with a bunch of beautiful stuff, we have beautiful stuff and then we're going to get ugly stuff right afterwards. Yesterday, we looked at this passage when Jesus had finished saying these things. He left Galilee. He went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan and large crowds followed him and he healed them there. This community that Jesus is painting a picture of is beautiful. It's filled with forgiveness and long suffering. And even though the warnings against failing to forgive are very stout and intimidating still, people are smart enough to look at this and be like a forgiving community of faith. That is sustainable because these people could look inside their hearts and know that they didn't match up. They knew that they were they needed mercy. They needed forgiveness. And so even if the expectation was, Hey, like you got to give forgiveness away too. They were like, that's a great deal. You kidding me? I get forgiven $312 million. And all I got to do is forgive a few thousand metaphorical dollars. Yeah, I can do that all day long. So they sign up and they follow Jesus across political boundaries. Now they're in Judea. One geographical note here, the part of Judea, the region they would be in as they crossed the Jordan here would be Korea. I think I'm saying that right. And there was a very significant, maybe the most significant recent previous messianic claimant was from Korea. And there's a reason that he caught on there. There was an itch that still hadn't been scratched for the people of this region. I feel like maybe Simon was on to something in this region east of the Jordan. They would have had their antenna out for messiah type characters. And so probably some of this crowd wasn't just people who were following him, but people who'd heard the reputation and they were intrigued by Simon of Korea who didn't work out. And now Jesus is here and let's see what it's about. So when Jesus goes and does all of these healings and everything in part, this is an extension of what's already been going on. But there's a little bit of subtext here that this would have been his first foot in the door for all of these people who had messianic questions and surely wanted to see what Jesus is about. So he doesn't just pass the test of the messiah in one place and assume that word will spread. In this case, he chose to pass the test of the messiah for another people group who would have been curious about what was going on. But onto the promised friction that comes right after this beautiful moment out in the desert. Verse three, some Pharisees came to him to test him and they asked, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason? To you and me, our brains are going to go straight to the now question. I mean, somebody went to Jesus in the Bible and they were like, why are people allowed to get divorced? Well, divorce still affects us. That's still a concept. We still have marriage. We still have marriages that fail that don't work out sometimes, inoculously, sometimes explosively divorces it. It's a thing. It's something that you've got to think about. It's something that religious people think about a lot. So we would be tempted to look at this and be like, well, those people who want to know Jesus' take on this hot button issue. But there are a few layers behind this question that I think are important before we can understand Jesus' response. There were two schools of thought on divorce at this time that were very popular. There was one rabbi who had long taught that divorce is only legit if there's some kind of sexual immorality. Now, again, we're going to be tempted in an equitable society to think in terms of both directions. Well, like if the dude does something wrong, then, okay, that must mean that the lady can divorce him. Overwhelmingly, this conversation would have been one directional. If a woman does something outside of the marriage they are asking, then can a dude divorce her? Divorce is the other way. We're not very common at all. So one perspective is, no, divorce is not allowed religiously except for this very extreme explosive situation. But there was another school of thought from the very famous Rabbi Hillel, whose name still often comes up, who was more like, ah, you know, things don't work out sometimes. There are more reasons for divorce that could be allowed or permitted. So what you have here are Pharisees coming to Jesus and inviting him into their rule oriented debate between a group that's a little more fundamentalist, hardcore with the rules and another group that maybe leans a tiny bit toward being more progressive. Those categories don't translate to today, either. What I mean by fundamentalist and progressive is nothing like what that looks like in today's religious political ideological spectrum. But I think you get what I'm talking about. And so why would you come and ask? Is it that these Pharisees would really like to settle this fight? Well, no, I mean, the text attributes motives to them right here. Some Pharisees came to him to test him. Okay. So they're coming because this hasn't been solvable. Here's an unsolvable question. And we're going to catch you in a trap. And this should obliterate your credibility with half of the people, the Pharisees who were asking the question probably don't know or even care which half of the people will be disgusted by his answer. But if you just keep asking these questions and keep cutting his following in half by forcing him to alienate people by picking the one or the zero, eventually you can get him whittled down enough and following and power that you can kill him and make him go away. This is kind of a novel approach to getting rid of messianic characters, the discredit them. Usually he's calling the Romans. You send out some legions and you kill him. But the difference here is that unlike Simon of Korea and these other previous messianic claimants, Jesus hadn't taken up arms. In fact, he'd openly discouraged taking up arms. The Pharisees are evolving. They're adapting. They're modifying their techniques for how to partner with the state to get rid of messianic claimants. They reject. And here they're smart enough to read the writing on the wall and say like swords aren't going to get it done. That's going to backfire on us. And so they just simply come with this very loaded question. More loaded I think than you or I as a modern audience member can possibly appreciate basically asking like give us your take on divorce. Is there any reason that that would be lawful? We're going to be talking about this topic over the next few days and the stuff I said at the beginning of this episode applies to all of it. I want to be candid. I want to be honest about what's in front of us in the text. And I want that conversation to happen with anybody who's been touched by the phenomena of divorce to know that I have a soft spot in my heart for what you've gone through. With that said, we will pick it up where we left off next time around looking at Jesus' answer to this loaded question. I'm Matt. So the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
