 Hey, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And yesterday we had a conversation about this ancient word, mammon, that a lot of times gets translated as money in the modern translations of the New Testament. But definitely, mammon is the word behind the text in the original languages in Matthew chapter 6, where Jesus says, you cannot serve both God and money. And this concept of people becoming overburdened with their love of stuff to the point of parallax analysis, and people coming to a place where they worship this notion or even ancient Near Eastern deity that is mammon. This becomes people's God. This concept is something that Jesus gradually has been pushing back on with more and more specificity as we work through the book of Matthew. And he makes this little note back here in Matthew chapter 6 that comes and goes pretty quickly about you can't serve both God and money. But lately we've been in Matthew chapter 19 looking at the story of the rich young ruler who had so much stuff and he wanted eternal life, but he wasn't willing to give away his stuff and unburden himself of those things. And as a result, he walks away sad. So we started that conversation yesterday. If you haven't listened to that, you might want to go grab it. Otherwise we're picking it up right now where we left off yesterday. So then we flip back forward to Matthew chapter 19. I don't think the word mammon gets used anywhere here. I'm not seeing the word money being translated, but wealth at the end of verse 22 when the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had great wealth. The word there is Tamata, which just refers to possessions. He had a whole bunch of possessions. But I think, and this is what I'm driving at, that the principle holds between the two. Jesus seems to be teaching that love of stuff is very destructive. Jesus is clearly and consistently teaching that love of stuff and love of God do not mingle well. You got to pick a God one way or the other and that heavy, loaded down Skyrim backpack full of stuff. It first, as you start filling it up with all of these swords and flowers and herbs and plants and potions and arrows and all of these other things, you're like, this is my safety. The more things I have in here, the more I'm ready for whatever I encounter. This gives me security. I could sell these things and buy a video game house and I could just go sit in the video game house and look at all of my beautiful trophies. But what you figure out is you cross a certain threshold and you don't own the stuff. The stuff owns you. You can't even move anymore. You're paralyzed. Your world gets way, way smaller. And then you go to the shop and you have to sell things and get rid of it. And it's just video game stuff. It's just ones and zeros, pixels. It doesn't matter. And you're like, ah, I can't sell that. I might need that later. Well, I can't do that. What if I run into a wizard? I would need to throw that at him. Well, I can't sell that one flaming arrow. What if there's some reanimated skeleton? They really don't like those. And it's so difficult to figure out what stuff has got to go to get back to a place where you're unburdened and unencumbered by it. Part of the genius of that game is that it taps in so deeply to familiar human nature. And even more so, the genius of Jesus teaching is that he understands human nature better than anyone ever. And he knows what screws us up. He knows the thing that makes us tied to this temporary life, this moment, this blip in the grand scheme of eternity. And he knows it's our stuff and the artificial sense of security and self-sufficiency that comes from it. So it would seem then that what Jesus is trying to benevolently do in the life of this rich young ruler and in the lives of anybody who would come along and read this text later on is to lighten that burden. Therefore, when Jesus is saying throughout Matthew, paraphrases mine here, to unburden yourself with the stuff, get rid of the stuff, unload the stuff, don't be loyal to the stuff. He's not trying to rob us. He's trying to help us. We could easily move on from this passage focusing on what I've focused on for most of our discussion, which is the intellectual, theological conundrum of which comes first. God's action or our ability to humble ourselves. It's a fascinating question. It's an important question, but ultimately action is all we have control of, even if it's just a perception of controlling our action. And clearly the call of this text is to say, you are overburdened. You have a false deity to whom your heart is pledged, named Mammon. And until that goes away, this kingdom thing is not ultimately going to make sense. You can't be a son, a daughter, an heir, a child of the king while you still have the knee bent to that false God. And with that, the Rich Young Ruler is in good company. Jesus sent it back in chapter eight when the guy said he wanted to follow, and he's like, hey, I'm homeless, heads up. Following me is not about pleasing the God of Mammon, but he drives at home really hard right here. And I think this is the point in Matthew chapter 19, where probably a lot of people who go through this thing chronologically are like, and I'm out much like the Rich Young Ruler. I just can't do that, and I'm going to have to tap out because this is the true dividing line between our world currency and our kingdom currency. It's the true dividing line about the loyalty of the human heart. And if it's difficult for you, as it is for me, the one thing I would encourage you to think about is to not follow the example of the Rich Young Ruler and make that final decision right there, but instead to take time to think about this, to size it up, to count the cost of following Jesus even more carefully. For the last thought here, I want to bounce back to the end of chapter 11, and I want to do so with that image of Skyrim and your characters overburdened backpack and your characters. Paralysis and inability to engage with the world or fight the world shrinks in Skyrim when you get too much stuff because you can't go and explore this gigantic, beautiful thing and achieve the things that are transcendent and meaningful. Because you're overburdened, you love your stuff too much, and all you can do is protect your horde at that point. You think it's going to give your character life and make the game interesting, but instead your stuff just ruins it. With that thought about our cumbersome stuff burdens rattling around in the back of our heads, let's go back and revisit Jesus words in Matthew 11, 28. I think they will ring more true given the work we've put in and given that we've made it all the way to Matthew 19. Here's what he says. Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me from gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
