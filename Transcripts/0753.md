 Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. I think it was mentioned in one time this event that occurred in the legacy of the old rivalry between the University of Colorado buffaloes and the University of Nebraska fighting corn huskers. They used to be rivals. They would play around Thanksgiving week all the time. At one time, the great and legendary coach of the Nebraska corn huskers, Senator Tom Osborne. He was out there on the field and the Colorado buffaloes. Their thing is they got an actual Buffalo, a real one. They name it Ralphie. They've had like eight of them because they keep dying because buffaloes don't live that long, I guess, but they, they run the Buffalo around the field to get everybody hyped up for their one and eight football team that has been horrible for decades and decades. But the Buffalo run, it really is pretty cool. And I don't know if you've ever been around buffaloes, but as a man of the West, I can tell you they're bigger than you think. And they're very intimidating. Like these giant skulls and they gore people at Yellowstone all the time. Because people don't get it. They one ripped off some ladies pants who went up and tried to pet it here in the black hills of South Dakota a little while ago. So they, they take this buffalo and they harness the power of the buffalo and they run it around the field and it's just barely under control. One time the Nebraska corn huskers are in town to play the Colorado buffaloes and Nebraska players and coaches are out on the field and they run the Buffalo. And Tom Osborne sand in there and the buffaloes running right at him. And Tom Osborne is like, I'm not going to move. And he didn't move. And the Nebraska radio announcers, they really liked it. And they thought that was some kind of omen for how Nebraska is going to defeat Colorado that day. And I don't remember what happened in the game. I just remember it being viewed as a modern omen. And we think of that as being kind of silly, right? Like obviously that doesn't really affect much. You don't have a portent of things to come from that or do you. There's a little bit of that superstition left, a little bit of that sense that things mean things and they're connected in ways that you can't necessarily see, but that stuff like that does bode in a certain direction. Well, certainly if we have a little vestiges of that still lingering in our psyche, how much more so in the classical world when you're closer to like the age of the Greek oracle and things like that would people have really thought in terms of, no, the stuff that happens in the natural world. There's an order to think there are signs and the divine could communicate to the human through some of those signs. And as weird as this house to us is very modern minded people, this is even assumed in the book of Matthew right from the very beginning. Remember those magi, their Persian megaces from the east and the tradition of Daniel from the courts of people like Cyrus of the Great and Darius I. And they look at these stars and they see a sign that turned out to be true when they went to find the king of the world, the Messiah, but a lot of these signs that come up in the Bible, they're not just ambiguous like, oh, I think it means something. There's some kind of more specific metaphor there. Jesus light of the world because it's a star and it's really bright. And whenever you're talking about these omens or signs, extra biblically in fiction or in the Bible, you see that there can be a few different layers of meaning to this thing. The sign can be evocative of a lot of different stuff. And I think that's what we're running into with this temple curtain tearing, right? You got a part of the temple complex that is available to everybody, Jews and non-Jews, Gentiles, but then you got a part of the temple that's only available to Jews. And then you got a part of the temple that's only available to God and like one human mediator high priest who can sneak in there once a year and do their priestly activities and then get right back out. Well, if the curtain is tearing, that certainly could be interpreted by anybody you heard about it, tearing from top to bottom even. Ah, that's God from on high tearing apart the division that separates people. And indeed, later on in the New Testament, we get all that language about how in Christ in this new family of faith, there isn't Jew or Gentile or man or woman or slave or free, like all of those divisions are broken down in this new family of faith. It certainly seems to communicate that here in Matthew 27, when right after Jesus dies, it says at that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn into from top to bottom. Modern Christians tend not to think of it in this context, but if we step outside of our own modern read and water that's already gone over the waterfall in his way downstream, we think about it in terms of what the original audience would have done. Man, there's only a few chapters earlier that Jesus really condemned the religious leadership, the priesthood that was in place at this point. He indicated that there is some kind of judgment coming, not just in his rebuke of the religious leaders in 23, but also throughout the Olivet Discourse in 24 and 25, where we spent so much time together. It would be very natural for Jesus to get killed. Then this thing immediately happens. For people to look at that and be like, that is a sign from God that Jesus is vindicated. He was right. The metaphorical coins are going to be taken away from those faulty religious leaders and given to somebody who does kingdom stuff with it, somebody who gets a return. The care of the vineyard metaphorically is going to be taken away from those religious leaders. This is an act of judgment tearing this curtain. Somebody else is going to do it or you could read it yet a third way. I think this is the one that the Bible really spells out, especially if you go and read the book of Hebrews, chapters eight and chapter nine, you can read it a third way, which is just to say, this is God breaking down the role of the human priesthood, at least permanently and replacing that mediating means of access between fallen humanity and holy God with Jesus himself, this great high priest who now properly stands in the gap and gets everything right and is perfect in this role of mediator. Okay. I told you I want to talk more about the thickness of this thing and I just can't shake it. I got to talk about it for a minute because it is so interesting. Now, look, for three days, I've been saying, well, we've got to talk more about the thickness of this curtain because that's an interesting legend that goes with it. And yeah, that's a lot of hype for something I'm going to cover actually pretty quickly. There are sources early on in Jewish tradition to say that this thing was a hand with like four inches thick. The curtain literally four inches thick. How do you even do that? Well, they're talking about having like hundreds of people who make this curtain, even maybe suggesting that these curtains were made annually. There are references to this in the Mishnah and the Talmud and the suggestion that it was so heavy and thick that it would take 300 priests to move it. If it got dirty in any way and they needed to clean it because this would be the equivalent of an iron gate, just massive and thick. Now if that is literally true, then that tearing from top to bottom is pretty compelling beyond just the symbolic nature of it. It's a demonstration of power in the style of the medieval European power encounters where the Christian missionary goes in as a showdown with the local pagan priest and the power of God outshines the power of Woden or Zeus or whoever. And then people in those pagan European communities, much like the centurion in Matthew 27, look at that and they're like, dang, nope, truly that is the one true God. So I have heard that thing repeated a lot. You're talking about like a four inch thick curtain, which is just mind boggling in terms of the physics of that. However, in digging deeper into this for the purposes of our conversation, I discovered that a few generations later, other Jewish rabbi and leaders actually wrote commentary on that first century claim that this curtain was four inches thick, a hand breadth thick. And those later rabbis wrote of that proclamation of the thickness of the curtain by their predecessors that this was a verbal device that this was intentional hyperbole meant to illustrate how important it was and how thick the division was and that the reality is that it was a very big curtain, but certainly not four inches thick. Now, that could lead us into a whole other conversation about the evolution of Jewish thought over the first few centuries after the time of Christ. Jewish thought is not a singular monolithic thing when you look back at it throughout history. People thought different stuff at different times and Judaism was actually very dynamic during this era, not just in the Levant, Jerusalem, Judea, that area, but also between the Jewish centers in Alexandria in North Africa and back in Babylon, former Persia, back East, things were very, very diverse. There was a lot of writing back and forth. There was a lot of trying to reconcile the thoughts of previous generations and priestly writings. So as an outside onlooker to Judaism here, we might be running into some of those frictions and evolutions as we just try to make sense of what this curtain looked like. What I know is this. Josephus gives us a beautiful description in the Wars of the Jews chapter five of a curtain that sounds exactly like what was described in the passages we were looking at yesterday in Exodus. It's beautiful. It's a representation of the firmament and the skies and nature and the heavens and all of the things that roamed the earth, this beautifully artfully crafted thing. So maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree when I'm like, dang, it ripped. And if it was really thick, that would be more impressive. Maybe there's another layer of meaning here in that it was art and it got shredded. Think about how you felt the last couple of weeks when you saw the climate activists, the anti-oil activists, regardless of whether you agree with their cause or not. Think about how it felt to see them throw tomato soup on famous, beautiful works of art, even if the art did have some kind of covering to it or the real one was hidden somewhere in the back. It's art. It's something that's timeless. It's something that communicates beauty on all kinds of levels and it got wrecked. It messes with you. It makes you feel like things are changing and there's a reason that an activist would target something like that. Because it gets our attention today, if Josephus' description of what this curtain looked like, regardless of its width, is correct, then we do have another level here of significance in what's being communicated, what this sign symbolizes and means to the original audience when this thing gets ripped top to bottom. At the most basic level, I think what we're supposed to take from this one is that the dividing wall between God and man is being taken apart with the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. The problem of the Bible is the divide between God and man. The solver of that problem, as we discussed yesterday, logically has to be God. The story throughout the whole Bible indicates that it would be God, God, not people, is the main character of the Bible. And I think we as readers are supposed to look at what happened here and be like, oh, dang, we're messing with like the most fundamental defining parameter of the human condition by ripping that curtain. I have to see what happens next. We'll talk about those other signs that happened at the same time in the centurion's response to that tomorrow. As I mentioned in that Saturday bonus episode, so many of you have been kind enough to go back and listen to. Thank you for doing that. I do have a sponsor that we're bringing on board for the next couple of months. And I'm really, really excited to get to work with these folks. It's Samaritan Ministries. This episode is not sponsored. I'm just giving you a heads up. I'm going to tell you a little bit more about what that means in the coming weeks. And same deal is with anybody who does anything on the internet, even considering supporting the sponsors when they do come along is a great way to support the podcast. You never have to do anything like that. There's never any expectation, but I'm excited to put this in front of you because I'm not going to put things in front of you that I think are a bad idea. I'm only going to put things in front of you that I think are an awesome idea. And then ultimately you decide for yourself whether it makes sense for you and your family. So I'm going to tell you more about that. Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
