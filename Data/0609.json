This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we are working in detail on the front end of the parable of the 10 versions of the 10 bridesmaids at the beginning of Matthew chapter 25 as crazy. Like sometimes, you know how they say you get like 50 years of history in just two weeks and just everything goes so fast. This is one of those places where there is so much payoff so much illusion to other things from around the Bible that have been waiting for payoff and it's all just tucked into like the first sentence or sentence and a half of Matthew 25. So yeah, we are lingering here a little bit but we're doing it for a reason and I think that what we're gonna find is that as we do this background work on this parable of the 10 bridesmaids or 10 virgins, what we're gonna discover is that this whole parable just neatly falls into place once we've got that. And I think it is a very important payoff. So we're gonna keep working on that. If you didn't listen to yesterday's episode you're gonna want it because it's gonna make all of this go and Jeff's got a little thing that he does in the music and then we're right back into it. Jose is the smoking gun, right? That's a part of the Old Testament that most obviously comes to mind in terms of this imagery of God as husband to his people. But there is more Jeremiah 31 and this one I did have to look up and write down because I never would have remembered it was Jeremiah 31 and I did write down the verse. It is verse 32. Here we go. It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers. Oh, I know this one. Oh, I know this one. I should have looked it up first when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt because they broke my covenant though I was a husband to them. I'm super famous. I'm leaving this in there though. I'm not gonna hide my shame that I totally forgot where that was because guess what? Nobody knows all the things about the Bible and through the power of editing we could easily give the false impression that one does know all the things about the Bible. It's a really big book and that's a really, really famous verse that illustrates this point. Maybe as famously as what I just pointed you to in Jose. Oh, well, whatever. I am humbled as always. I think you're getting the point. There's at least two more that I found reference that other people had pulled together and doing research on the same thing regarding this use of husband imagery in the Old Testament. What I'm driving at with all of this is that Jesus isn't coming out of left field here at the beginning of Matthew chapter 25 and being like, what if God's relationship with people was like, I don't know a bridegroom and a bride roll with me on that one for a minute. Rather, he's drawing on imagery that has already been deeply internalized by his audience, that has already been deeply internalized by the disciples because of their upbringing. And in a way, Jesus' use of this imagery is rearranging, redefining, maybe even clarifying what his relationship with his disciples is like. And for those who read through the Gospels and they see the 12 disciples somehow being, I want to be careful here in terms of how I framed this and I don't know butchered the theology of it. An evolution or completion or some symmetry with those 12 disciples with the 12 tribes. And maybe not that they necessarily like become Israel or speak for all of Israel, but that there's some kind of correlation there and that a bunch of the aspects of the relationship between God and his chosen people. So carry over somehow present in the relationship between God and his disciples and the people who they're going to talk to about the message of the kingdom and who will sign up because of what those disciples do and say. I think that's present. It can't be overlooked. Although I think if we're just looking at Matthew chapter 25 to try to make sense of what role do the disciples play and how does that relate to Israel? I'm not sure we have quite enough here in this passage to nail that down in a satisfactory way. I think I warned you up front yesterday. There's going to have to be a double episode because there's a lot of Bible that we got to bounce around to here and making sense of the front end of this parable of the 10 versions or the 10 bridesmaids. And this other stuff that I want to poke around at is stuff that's hinted at or alluded to also right here in the book of Matthew in the New Testament. And the first thing that I think bears mentioning is just one more reminder that chapter 25 is definitely a continuation of the thoughts in chapter 24 because you remember back in 24 when Jesus was like, all right, you got what you need to know about when the son of man is going to come back. I might be like some little delays or wrinkles in there. But basically you can tell when it's getting close because of how fig trees are. And then in verse 37 of Matthew 24, so about two paragraphs behind where we are right now, you recall he says, as it was in the days of Noah, so it'll be at the coming of the son of man. For in the days before the flood, remember this part? People were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. I think Jesus is introducing this imagery in 24 37 and 38. And then he's coming right back to this imagery at the beginning of chapter 25 with this parable. We're looking at right now is pretty obviously about wedding stuff. But that isn't the first allusion to a wedding that we've seen in recent conversation from Jesus because remember at the beginning of chapter 22, which is in what just like a day or two of what's happening in chapter 25, you get the parable of the wedding banquet. That's the one where it's time to have the wedding and everybody's been letting. No, wedding's going to happen. And people are like, I got some stuff I got to do. I have to take my bird to the vet. I don't think that makes sense for me right now. And then the master of the house when the servants come back, they're like, nobody's coming to your wedding. Super sorry, the master's like fine. We'll go out to the highways and byways, go to the street corners. We're having a wedding one way or another. We're going to celebrate it, bring them in. And then everyone's compelled to come in and have a wedding banquet. This is happening. But also remember that that's where we get the allusion to the wedding crashers, the people who came in and did not maybe accept the wedding attire that was offered or maybe they were expected to somehow come up with their own wedding attire because of the financial benefit that would come from getting to attend this wedding. They were expected to be able to understand that this would be a good investment of whatever resources they could scrounge up. And they didn't. I don't know that part of the text isn't clear as to why some people didn't have the gear on and why this was such an offense. But it was and it ends with the master being like, no, you don't understand the wedding. You're not here for the right reasons. You're not getting it. You're going to leave the wedding. But there's still more recent references to weddings and marriages and things like that. Remember the marriage at the resurrection question that happens also in chapter 22 where the Sadducees come up and they're like, okay, so say there's this lady and she just starts marrying brothers. And one is time they all die and then they're all dead and they all go to this afterlife that you imagine happens to Jesus who she married to there. And they're trying to point out that the whole thing is going to be ridiculous. You recall that Jesus kind of pivots off of that to be like, well, God's the God of the living. You're trying to make fun of the idea of resurrection and eternal life. But that is definitely a value of the kingdom. It's definitely a thing that my father does. My point is I don't think it's an accident here that throughout the Old Testament, we have this motif, this recurring pattern of God characterizing himself as a husband to Israel or as a bridegroom. And always expectant this language in the Old Testament, like something is coming. Then in Matthew chapter 5, 17, Jesus indicates right at the beginning of everything that he's saying about everything and introducing himself in this kingdom. He's like, hey, I'm here to fulfill all the stuff that happened before it and come to abolish it. I'm here to complete it. In other words, if we apply that to this motif of the bridegroom, the wedding stuff in the Old Testament, then what Jesus would be in part fulfilling would be that it's wedding time. And it's headed toward the culmination of that long betrothal. We're getting toward the point where that goes from something we anticipate to something that's going to happen. And indeed, even the fact that the betrothal and inching toward being married situation occurs with Mary and Joseph early on in the book of Matthew and also at the beginning of the book of Luke, even that is meant to conjure in the mind of the audience that there is this, there's this lingering, flapping thread in the Old Testament of I didn't God say he was going to, you know, like be the bridegroom. What does the wedding look like? Does that happen? Is there a banquet? It seems like the engagement has gone on for a really long time and it's been really rocky. What is, what's the plan there? What's the long term thing? And then Jesus language with increasing intensity throughout the book of Matthew starts to suggest as a function of like raw frequency of mentions alone that keep your eye on this wedding, husband, bridegroom motif, that is going somewhere in my heart. I feel like yesterday I was saying two part episode, two part episode at the beginning of all of this. No, it's going to be a three part episode because I got more than I want to cover because I do not yet think we are properly set up for total success in Matthew chapter 25. And so we're going to need another day on that. I am going to hit pause there and on the way out the door, I'm going to say thank you again to everyone who's taken the time to leave a review on one or even multiple podcast apps. Dang that helps. What an amazing thing. Thank you so, so much for doing that. I mean, the kind words are awesome, but even the greater concern is just want to include more people in our conversation. And that is like the best way to make it happen. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that reviews are not. I appreciate every single one of you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
