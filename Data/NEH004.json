And a couple of weeks ago, I was traveling with my family and we had an Uber driver. And I could not quite place her accent, but it seemed really familiar. And I don't know if you're supposed to ask. I think it's friendly to ask. I like to know where people are from. So I always ask and I asked, where are you from? She was delighted to tell me that she's from Transelania. It's like, oh, that's the coolest thing ever. No wonder I recognize your accent. It's like Saturday morning cartoons and stuff that makes perfect sense. We had a big laugh and it was super fun. And I think I read the room right. It's possible that I did not, but it seemed like we had a nice time. And so I started asking her questions about Romania and Transylvania. What are the mountains like there? Is it spooky in the fall? What's the deal? How do locals think of Vlad Dracul? Vlad the Impaler? What's their opinion of him? And she told me the whole story and all of that stuff. And I asked her if she'd ever read Bram Stoker's Dracula because it's a book that I love. And she's like, oh, yeah, yeah, we got a lot of tourist money because of that book. And we laughed some more. And she was just great. But it got me thinking more the last couple of weeks about how much I love that book. Bram Stoker's Dracula. Have you ever read that? It's the first kind of spooky book that I ever read for myself. I think it is a literary classic. I think it's brilliant. And it's also, in addition to being the first hair-raising thing I ever read, it's the first found footage book I ever read. Like the Blair Witch Project is found footage or Clover Field. Is that the name of the movie that came out later? It's found footage. It's not just a single camera that goes around and knows all and sees all. It's like cell phone footage and security camera footage. And it's all cobbled together. Like there's an all-knowing editor after the fact. You got access to all of that to put it together to tell the story without adding the narrator's own voice. Well, that's how Dracula, Bram Stoker's Dracula is. It's memorandums and diary entries and receipts and travel records. And it's super, super fun. I have a copy. Hang on. I got it. I'm coming back. I got a copy of it. I got the copy that I first bought and that I first read way, way, way back when. So the chapters in this book, for example, are like, here's one. Dr. Seward's Diaries. You're getting it from the perspective of Dr. Seward. Mina Harker's Journal. There's more Dr. Seward's Diaries. What else we got in here? That's some Van Helsing because he sounds cool. The Paul Mall Gazette. There's a newspaper clipping that's part of this. Lucy Westerner's Diaries. Yeah. So it's a whole bunch of stuff like that. It all adds up to one big cohesive story, but you encounter it in such a weird and interesting way. Okay. There's a reason that I'm telling you all about this. No, there are two reasons that I'm telling you about this. One, because I thought it was really cool that that lady was from Transylvania, Thrawns Laplania, and that we got to talk about Graham Soker's Dracula. And two, because it's kind of how Ezra and Nehemiah are. Ezra and Nehemiah are really one book. Some people even argue that first and second chronicles and Ezra and Nehemiah are all one big block of writing meant to sort of reset the whole story of the Old Testament in light of the stuff that went down in exile. I don't know if they're all necessarily to be viewed as one volume, but I'm pretty convinced that Ezra and Nehemiah were originally considered one volume. And there's still different traditions that view them basically as one thing. Obviously in the Protestant Christian Bible, it's Ezra and then Nehemiah. But it looks like there's a lot of shared authorship or oversight or shared editing between the two, but you can't really say Ezra wrote Ezra and Nehemiah or Nehemiah wrote Ezra and Nehemiah. I don't think that would make sense anyway, because there isn't one author. The author of this book is really more of an editor or an aggregator because you get some narrative. You'll see this as we get into it. Some of it that's the 10,000 foot view and the all knowing narrator just says, and then this happened in the royal court to Varda Xerxes and he said this and Nehemiah said that and then this thing occurred. But then there's also records that are clearly born out of travel receipts that clearly whoever wrote this had access to itineraries and bills that were probably sent by one party, probably back to the throne to be paid out. There's also letters, letters from people who like Nehemiah and also letters from people who don't like Nehemiah and other characters in the book. There's also personal reflections from Nehemiah and Ezra that are present in here. In some, I added this up a while back. I don't remember the exact number, but I think I came up with maybe as few as six, maybe as many as 10 different types of sources that are being cobbled together here. That's really cool in part just because we don't know that much about Persia. We don't have that much original stuff from Persia, which is crazy that this incredible empire came and went that they dominated basically the whole known world, that they dominated culture, that they latched on to an entire globe's worth of different people's cultures and somehow amalgamized all of that into one mega-meta culture that centered around the Persian kings, the Persian emperors. This is dominated for 250 years. Then one little punk kid from Macedonia comes along Alexander the Great and wrecks the whole thing and completely shakes up the ant farm of that culture by mingling in Hellenism, Greekism. It's really just this tiny little window of uniquely Persian stuff, art, culture, sensibilities, humor, and we just get these tiny little glimpses into it. It's like we hear whispers from Persia. It's like we see shadows of Persia. It's like we see gravitational holes of Persia where a thing culturally must have been because of the attraction to it and all the orbits around it, but you can't quite see what the thing is. I don't know if that analogy makes sense, but it makes sense in my heart. So I'm fascinated by Persia and I think one of the things that gets underestimated and underappreciated about the Bible, especially Ezra and Nehemiah, and Esther and a little bit of second chronicles and some of the prophets is this is one of our most valuable sources at getting a sense of what Persia was like from an outside non-Greek perspective. And whoever wrote Ezra and Nehemiah pounded pavement, my friends, they busted their butts. They worked so hard. They put in the freedom of information requests. I'm guessing they didn't call it exactly that, but you get the idea. They put in requisitions. They dug through people's old receipt boxes and they pieced together all of this stuff to give what adds up to being a stunningly reliable account, especially because of how much of this book doesn't happen in the voice of the author. Now if you were here with me for Esther, think about how much of that book happened in the voice of the author. Pretty much all of it, right? I mean, when we get that little bit of a decree here or there, but even that feels pretty paraphrasing. Yeah, we get the gist of Haman's decree. We get a bit more specifics on Mordecai and Esther's counter decree. But really for the most part, all of Esther is being delivered to us through the voice of whoever that author was. But in Nehemiah, we're hearing from everybody, the good guys, the bad guys, the in-between guys, the completely bored bureaucrats who just stamped the paper and shuffled the thing on down the line. It creates this very different historical experience from most other books of the Old Testament. Now I think the Bible's wildly reliable. I have a very high, very optimistic view of the trustworthiness of the text. I know some of you maybe have a little different perspective on that. I love that we can still hang out together and we don't see everything the same way. I think this is why we can have nice things. But Ezra stands out to me as a very unique historical experience in the Old Testament. And I should say Ezra and Nehemiah. And I think it's going to be really fun for us to hit these different moments in the book and to think about what's happening here as best as we can through the lenses of whoever's voice we're getting this little detail from. And then also trying to read the whole thing in light of whoever did the work to assemble these things and whoever decided, now these are the receipts we're going to look at. This is the travel itinerary that's important. I'm not going to do that travel itinerary. This is the angry letter about Nehemiah's rebuilding project that we're going to include. There were three or four more, but they're kind of redundant. They're not quite as juicy. I'm not going to include them. This is the one that really tells the story. It gets it done. You all let's be efficient here and respect people's time. There's a whole human thought process here that we're going to try to detect as well behind it, not just what made it into Ezra and Nehemiah, but in regards to what did not make it in, what would have been redundant, unhelpful, you know, whatever it might be. So in summary, I love Bram Stoker's Dracula because it's built like no other book that I have ever read or that I'd ever read up until that point. It made it a different experience for me. Like I was living it in real time. Like I was unpacking it and like I couldn't just rely on a single all seeing narrator to bail me out if I got confused. I had to cobble this together. And what I loved about that book as a young man and still is that I felt like the author, Bram Stoker, assumed my competence, assumed that I could follow the trail of breadcrumbs and arrive at the right places. And I think the author likewise of Ezra and Nehemiah assumes your competence across the ages. It assumes that the truth of the situation is so immutable obvious that if he just puts the details, the facts without even really putting much of a spit shine on it in front of you that the God ordained truth of what's going on here, the narrative of this thing and the right conclusion of what to make of it will be self evident. And I think it's going to be a lot of fun to unpack a book like that together. I think the next thing that we need to do is get up to speed on Ezra. Again, I really want to get into Nehemiah very quickly like the actual text. So I think we'll do a lightning overview of Ezra just to get really the first half of the book, the prequel so that we can dive deeply into the sequel with all of Ezra clearly in view as well. Man, I'm having fun. It is really good to be back. I know that for you, if you just listen to this every day, well, it feels like we've been hanging out every day since forever. But stuff got crazy for me about a month ago. And I had to work ahead and I got real sick and my family got sick and there was travel plans that got canceled and then we made new ones and it just, it went nuts. And so I'm super excited because I feel like I haven't seen you for a while and it's really nice to hang out and I love that we get to do this. And I guess we'll do some more of it tomorrow. All right. And Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
