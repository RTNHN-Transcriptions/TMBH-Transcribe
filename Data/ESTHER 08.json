    "text": " One of the kid, my grandparents, who lived in the Black Hills of South Dakota, you know, by Mount Rushmore, they took me to this little town up in the hills called Hot Springs. And at Hot Springs, they had opened up a mammoth, a woolly mammoth dig site. Apparently, a whole bunch of these prehistoric elephants, I don't know what happened, mast suicide, or they got stuck in a ditch, or somebody hunched them all. I don't know how they died, but they all died, and they're all right there. And you could go there, you could pay a little admission fee. I think you still can. And you could just walk in and stay behind the railing and you could just watch all of these real live experts digging right there and just see them excavating these dead behemoths from millennia ago. And it's the coolest thing I ever saw. And I remember after that, I was just, I was a cloud nine coming home from that, all excited about dinosaurs and what secrets lay covered in the earth. And then I went home and we got like a weekly reader or something in class that week. And it was about some discovery in the desert in the Middle East. And I was like, this is what I need to be for. I mean, this is the job that I want. I want to be an archaeologist. I want to dig things up. Never happened. I'm a piece with that. But I have never lost my obsession with that idea of secrets that have been gone forever, forgotten to humanity being pulled back out of the dirt, uncovered from the sands of time. And that lost knowledge given back to us with concrete proof whereby the person who wanted to preserve that knowledge back in the day with their own hands cut out a message that would be sent forward in time to whoever would see it next. And in this case, it's us. That's just rad. And yesterday, we were talking about how we know anything at all about Persia and Esther. Where do we even start with an idea like knowledge? I'm making the quote unquote signs with my fingers. When it comes to something this old, how can you know quote unquote sign again, anything? Well, we talked yesterday about one way of knowing is by looking at what people wrote down back then. And we actually have a few very old histories of roughly this era that the Book of Esther is held out as having happened during. And we can read those guys and we can composite together a sense of what was going on. We talked about TCs. We talked about Xenophon. And we talked about the granddaddy of Amal, the father of history, Herodotus of Halicarnesus yesterday. Those guys are going to come up a lot over the course of our conversations about the Book of Esther. There's also stuff that somebody was digging in the desert with the shovel and there was a clinking sound and they called everybody over and they pulled it out of the ground and secrets that were long, long lost to humanity were rediscovered. And now you even you could go to say the British Museum and just look at this artifact for yourself and see physical, tangible proof of certain facts that were preserved by the Persians and handed down through the ages to us. Isn't that cool? And it's not just the resuscitation of the knowledge. It's not just the physical, hard proof, but it's also that the characters who were reading about in these stories, they saw these inscriptions, some of these sculptures and statues and some of the reliefs that we're going to be talking about today that have been handed down through the ages. Like these rock stars, Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, Esther, they saw these things. You'll recall that the Book of Esther opens talking about how this is all happening in the Citadel of Susa. Well, we know where that is now. Some of those ruins have been dug up. Some of that art is still visible. You can see stuff that almost surely Queen Esther saw when all of this stuff was going down. There's one particular part of this building that as we get further into the story, we'll talk about it more, but Esther would have had to have walked right through there to go to the throne room to appeal to the king. Like the last piece of art she would have passed by, bizarre mythical beast sculpture, a relief and carved into the wall of that hallway. The last thing she would have seen is she inhales and exhales deeply to collect herself to walk in to see the king. You can still see. It's still there. That point of connection with history as well that comes with these kind of sources where they put eyes on it and now you can put eyes on it. And I am gushing. I do that from time to time. Let's talk about these sources or at least a few of the sources that the Persians themselves left behind that tell us things about how Persia was during time of Queen Esther. One of the most famous is a thing called the Cyrus cylinder. If you've ever seen one of those little JBL Bluetooth speakers, it kind of looks like a football with flat ends. That is what the Cyrus cylinder looks like. And indeed, it's about the size of a football with flat ends. Why did I go JBL speaker? I should have just gone with a football with flat ends because more people know what that looks like. You know, I'm relatively new at this. We've only done a few episodes. Thanks for your patience with me. And inscribed all around the surface area of that cylinder is some propaganda that it looks like Cyrus cooked up to help solidify his standing in the minds of his new subjects, particularly in Babylon so that they would realize that the gods had ordained that there was going to be a new empire now. It's not going to be Babylon anymore. It's going to be the Persians. Cyrus is going to be the king. And so from this cylinder, we learn some facts about Cyrus's lineage and his past. And we also learn some things about his strategies and what he thinks religiously. It's here that he spells out very explicitly who he's descended from, what his titles are and how the gods are behind it. Here's one passage from that. I am Cyrus, king of the world, great king, mighty king, king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters, the son of Cambyses. Now we've talked about Cambyses a little bit before. We're going to talk about them a lot more. Cyrus's father and son were both named Cambyses. You know, helpful detail. Talk about that one away. The son of Cambyses, great king, king of Anshan or Anshan, it says here. Grand son of Cyrus. So Cyrus the great, the one who founded the Persian Empire is actually Cyrus II. We just don't say that very often because he's Cyrus the great. The great sounds way better than the second. Grand son of Cyrus, great king, king of Anshan, descendant of test base. I never know quite how to say that. T-E-I-S-P-S, great king, king of Anshan. So what Cyrus has given us here is a look back into Persian history to back when they were more of a little regional tribe before they partnered up with the Medes and conquered the Babylonians and then before the Medes kind of faded out and the Persians became the big winners of all of this. It goes on to say, this is an eternal line of kingship whose rule, bell and Nabu love, whose kingship they desire for their heart's pleasure. When I entered Babylon in a peaceful manner, I took up my lordly abode and the royal palace amidst rejoicing and happiness. Marduk, the great lord, this is the patron deity of the Babylonians, established as his fate for me a magnanimous heart of one who loves Babylon and I daily attend to his worship. Think about how much we just learned there from Cyrus himself. We're talking about a guy who was alive 2500 years ago and we're hearing directly from him. I think that is so cool. And come on, you're smart, you can read between the lines there and figure out what he's trying to accomplish. He no doubt made a bunch of copies of this Cyrus cylinder. It's why it was football size. It's the kind of thing that you can hand out. It's like a business card or a pamphlet. And so he's given things out probably to noble people in Babylon who are kind of on the fence like do we need to revolt against you and reestablish Babylon? Or is this kind of a continuation of what we're doing before? How is this all going to play out? Are you going to cancel our religion and take us into captivity like we used to do to people? What can we expect? That's a Cyrus hands out these cylinders and it answers everybody's questions. Ah, okay. Well, you're descended from a lordly line. I get it. And oh, well, okay. You were well received by Babylon. So people want you here and you're being pretty humble about all of it. And you say, you love the city and you're so happy to be here. Is it greatest fans in the whole world? And then you go on to talk about how much you like Marduk and you're going to go ahead and worship him too. I mean, that's very religiously and convictionally flexible on his part, but also really good propaganda. Now, we obviously have to interpret the Cyrus cylinder as propaganda, but still it is useful and it gives us insight into who this founder of the Persian Empire is. Did I seriously already burn all of our time just by being excited about digging up mammoths and by the JBL speaker football cylinder of Cyrus? I sure did. But you know what? This is a beautiful thing. When we did that last series, which I guess we call season two of this podcast, there were hard deadlines, my friends. It was, Hey, today we are covering the book of second Chronicles. There is no tomorrow. It all has to happen in this episode. And it was kind of stressful. I mean, it was super fun. I really liked doing it, but it was a lot. There was no opportunity to bleed something over into the next day. But now I've got my beloved pace back. Now we can just take our time and dive as deep as we want. So tomorrow, I'm going to talk about some more rad stuff that went clink on the end of a shovel out in the desert. The bridges, the gap between us and this amazing people group who were around 2500 years ago. Thanks for hanging out with me. Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon."
