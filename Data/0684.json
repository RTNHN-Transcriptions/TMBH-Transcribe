This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we're talking about how much stabbing you're allowed to do in the name of Jesus. Peter did some stabbing and slashing in Matthew 26. Just tried it out and was like, well, maybe this would maybe this would make Christianity catch on better. If we just stabbed and slashed our way to some conversions and it's worked for some other religions, why not give it a try? And so that's what he does, but Jesus is not impressed. So let's go Matthew 26.47. Let's pick it up from the beginning of the story. While he, Jesus, was still speaking, Judas, one of the 12 arrived with him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. So there's our first point of contrast. The bad guys are here with swords and clubs operating under the cover of darkness. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him going at once to Jesus. Judas said, greetings Rabbi and kissed him. Jesus replied, friend, do what you came for. Then the men stepped forward, seized to Jesus and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus companions, one of the knowledge Peter reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. Verse 52, put your sword back in its place, Jesus said to him. For all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I can't call on my father and he'll at once put at my disposal more than 12 legions of angels? But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way? And then at that time, Jesus said to the crowd, am I leading a rebellion that you've come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching and you didn't arrest me. But this is all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Obviously, we got a lot to talk about there. Obviously, that fits with that theme of abandonment that we've been looking at elsewhere. But back to the stuff about violence and the sword yesterday, we were considering how the Old Testament portrays the dangerous boomerang effect of violence. We're talking about how the values of the kingdom that Jesus talks about in his physical lifetime here are different regarding violence and how you respond to even violence directed at you as a Christian. And Jesus is anticipating that his followers will imitate his approach to articulating the values of the kingdom moving forward. And indeed, they do. I referenced that book by Rodney Stark, which again, I think is called the rise of early Christianity. I do recommend that. So that gets us back to where we are. I mentioned at the end of our last conversation that the church initially was a persecuted church and not for a little while. We're talking for a real long time. The church endured persecution from Rome, even early on from the Jews gradually after a couple of failed rebellion attempts against Rome, the Jewish religious leadership lost teeth to the point that that persecution couldn't continue any further. And then the Jewish community and the Christian community kind of went into a stalemate for a period of centuries. Eventually though, the persecuted church becomes the persecuting church as a problem. It doesn't look much like Jesus or Christianity or the things that he taught. We start to see little hints of that when in the fourth century, some Roman emperors start to convert to Christianity. Constantine converts in the early fourth century as he is in the final stages of militarily sorting through his rivalry with another contender for the title of Emperor. That guy's name was Maxinitis. They had a battle famously at a battle, one that's portrayed at the Vatican Museum in a gigantic fresco and that battle is called the Battle of Milvian Bridge. And the story goes that on the eve of that battle, Constantine saw the guy in the row, the Greek symbols denoting Christ and Christianity and heard a message from on high saying, you know, conquer by this. And so he puts that on all the shields. They win the Battle of Milvian Bridge and in keeping with the classical style of being aligned with victorious deities and that is something that affirms one's claim to rulership Constantine aligns with a God that had not been popular among the Romans, at least at the political level for some time. Well, Constantine then declares Christianity a tolerated, not the official, but a tolerated religion with his edict of Milan. And then we get into a very complicated fourth century in terms of the relationship between the Roman state and the church. All of a sudden the Roman state starts to become involved in theological affairs with the overwhelmingly effective council of Nicaea, but that was called by an emperor. That's it's kind of a weird thing in terms of what that does for power and particularly for one aspect of the power of the state, which is the power of the sword. The government uniquely holds itself out as having the exclusive claim to violence in society. Some of my dear friends have pushed back on that and conversation suggesting that no, like the fact that you could hit somebody or you could have a gun and defend yourself means that the state does not have a unique claim to violence in society. But generally speaking, the state will then determine whether or not you use that violence legally and appropriately and if they determine you used it inappropriately and then we'll use violence against you, meaning that government ultimately is wherever the buck stops in terms of who uses violence and who declares whether you were right or wrong and choosing to use it yourself. I don't offer that definition in a way that's meant to criticize or praise government. I just think that's a practical reality of how the state works and that starts to become mingled as we get into the fourth century. And then you get an emperor named Theodosius who seems to be very enthusiastic about God, but he's got some problems with some people's behavior and he's still ruthlessly violent. There's an incident, wow, I don't remember for sure. I think it was in Thessalonica at a stadium where I mean, I did some kind of horrifying, like dark action movie kind of purge that happened in a stadium. Like they locked the doors and killed a bunch of people at Theodosius's command and the Bishop of Milan ended up calling him out and making him publicly repent for this. So now the church can call emperors to repentance. This raises some interesting dynamics. And well, the state now is starting to use the sword a little bit in defense of things that involve theology or the church. And then by the time you get into a less Roman and more European later classical age or early Middle Ages, we see multiple kings around Europe, not just the old Roman emperor who's now situated in the East, modern day Istanbul, Turkey, but you're also seeing powerful dynasties in France, the Merovingian dynasty, eventually the Carolingian dynasty starting in the sixth century and reaching prominence in the eighth and ninth centuries. I mean, the pope can call on said emperors to provide the pope with an army to go and defend the boundaries of Christendom. That's a very new relationship as well. And as these things become more intertwined, and as the church increasingly is responsible for affirming kings and emperors as anointed by God and as religious leaders, archbishops and popes are only really able to continue to exist at the good pleasure of the tax collecting and army wielding capital punishment wielding kings and emperors is kind of kind of tangled up situation. Well, eventually in the late first millennium, people start to have ideas that really upset the balance of things in terms of the relationship between the church and the state. And we do start to see that flip to a persecuting church, one that will lay siege, one that will go to war, one that will call crusades and some of those crusades end up being carried out against Jews in ghettos in Eastern Europe on the way to go and fight the Muslims. Some of those crusades end up being carried out against quote unquote heretics and I mean, just objectively, the Alpagensian crusade, the crusade against the Cathars in the Languedoc France region of southern France where this kind of splitter group of pseudo-Christians caught on. I mean, sure, on paper, yes, they were heretics, but they were citizens of Europe and you have a crusade being called by the pope using secular forces to go and violently arrest or eliminate them. So there's something really different about the first several hundred years of Christianity and how it catches on without the sword at all. I mean, nothing longer than the United States has existed. You have no proliferation of Christianity via the sword. It just isn't happening. Instead, the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church as Christianity spreads as sympathies are shifted from the violent oppressive state to the victims who courageously just stand there in a Colosseum and get torn apart by lions just to make a point. And these martyrs tell a compelling story and they appear to be more effective in stoking responsiveness to the message of Jesus and the kingdom than any amount of sword or gun play sense has ever been. It really was a golden age of the church in which early Christians endured all sorts of shocking types of persecution. But eventually Christianity becomes the man and it's easy to be the employee that sits in the cubicles with your pals and gripes about the boss. It's tough when you're the boss. You got to start swinging the sword and you got to start making decisions. And the church finds the same problem, not so much in the East where Islam rivals or even thwart Christian power, but specifically in the West where the Roman church has such a large role in governance like it or not that just comes with the sword. And the results of that are going to depend from person to person how you assess that in terms of whether you are more sympathetic to the Catholic church in the Middle Ages or meaning no disrespect to anyone today like me if you are more skeptical of what that institution looked like in the Middle Ages. I don't think that was the best era for the Roman church. And I would point to the violence wielded by the Catholic church in the Middle Ages as why I don't think it was the best era of the Catholic church. Easy task for them. Heck no. Am I empathetic to that? Yes, I am. But at the same time it just comes back to this. If you draw the sword, you die by the sword and that very principle that Jesus laid out right here the first time somebody took out a weapon and tried to kill people to advance his kingdom. That very principle proved to be the Achilles heel, the thorn in the side of the notion of Christendom, of a union of church and government that wields the sword domestically and foreign Lee, and that transcends even national boundaries. I mean this cautionary tale that we see in Exodus that we see with Heyman in the book of Esther and that Jesus explicitly points to here. Yeah, that's a tough one to overcome. Violence begets violence. Live by the sword. Die by the sword. And that saying has caught on and stuck the way it has. Thanks for indulging me. I really like these just quick looks at big swaths of history. That's fun for me. And so far you've all been very nice and very patient with that. So thank you for indulging me on this one again. All right, I'm leaving it there. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
