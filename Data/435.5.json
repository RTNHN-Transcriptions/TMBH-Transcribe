Yesterday, Matt was having a conversation with Daelin Woodall that went a little longer than they had expected, and so we're going to give you part two of that conversation today as a special bonus episode. Speaking of bonus episode, we had a special request on the subreddit from user ChaosFF6 requesting a specific song be played as soon as we could possibly make it happen. Well today's that day, so Chris W, user ChaosFF6, thank you for the awesome and hilarious note, this long distance dedication is for you. Come on now! Hey my friends, it's Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Last time around, I was sitting and talking with my buddy Daelin Woodall from Alabama about, I keep using the term, I don't know what else to call it, this equation, this otherworldly, other currency, other values based equation that Jesus gets and that he's running and that he is articulating to his disciples about how somebody goes from not being in the kingdom to being in the kingdom, and it's completely different and totally foreign from any other transaction that we have in the world, any other trade or deal that we make and it's confusing and it's a lot to take in but also it's like center cut Christianity, it's clearly very important, the text keeps pointing us back to it and so I want to pick up where we left off kicking this around with my buddy Daelin, we're in Matthew 19 verses 25 through 27, here that is just as a refresher, wait a minute, hey Daelin, you got a Bible in front of you? I do. You want to just read it because I always read it, I thought it might be fun to have you read it, 19, 25 through 27 but with Daelin voice? No pressure reading in front of the class, yeah absolutely. When the disciples heard this that were greatly astonished saying, who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, with man, this is impossible but with God, all things are possible. When Peter said in reply, see, we've left everything and followed you, what then will we have? Okay, so let me ask you this, in your understanding, in your read of this text, in your faith tradition, what percentage of somebody getting to a point where they go from outside the kingdom to inside the kingdom is dependent on God and what percentage is dependent on that person making decisions and making changes? I think God initiates the process. I think in terms of straight percentages, I think the work of transformation is 90% the work of God in our life. God brings us to an awareness of our sin. We accept the fact that we are sinful and then we realize, okay, God is real, I'm sinful. C.S. Lewis says, I have caused to be uneasy. What happens now? We go from here. And I think after we come to an awareness of sin and come to an awareness of sinfulness, and we began the process of discipleship, everything from then on happens through and by God urging us. There's this great line in mere Christianity where C.S. Lewis talks about how we learn to write and how the teacher often takes their hand and they overlay their hand above ours. And it's our hand that's making the letters, but it's the hand of the teacher that's doing the guiding. And I think that's a wonderful example and illustration of what authentic discipleship in the Christian life is like. It is God through the work of the Holy Spirit, through the example of His son Jesus. His hand is above our hand and it is leading us and guiding us and compelling us and motivating us and strengthening us and enliven us. But it is our hand that is making the impact, that's making the impression, that's making the letter in our life and in our context and in the environment around us. So I think it's a kind of partnership, it's a kind of symbiotic relationship, it's a kind of initiating and responding that's taking place. Or unfortunately in the case of this rich young ruler not taking place. This is challenging for me because it seems like there was a volitional moment with the rich young ruler. But it just looks like it from a human perspective. It looks like a kid walked up to Jesus was like, all right, let's talk about the equation I'd like to be in. And they had a bit of a negotiation, they ran the equation and the kid was like, I, price is too high. Right. I ran the calculation. This, I mean, it'd be cool if you could come down a little bit, but you seem pretty locked in on your position. Bummer. This is something I really wanted to buy. Something I really wanted to sign up for. You can't, it looks volitional. But then you move down a couple of verses to what you and I have been talking about mostly. And that doesn't sound volitional anymore. Now it sounds like, no, you just can't pull it off. You just simply cannot make the mental leap, the mental transformation from what happens in the world all the time where everything is a transaction, everything's a deal. I bring this much value, you bring that much value. And charity is kind of a deal for what it gives to the person who's doing the charity. Right. It looks like that passage is saying this transaction cannot happen without the superintendents of God. And I understand why the disciples almost feel despair at the situation. Absolutely. Because it isn't the same kind of transaction is anything else we ever do ever. Absolutely. And I think there is a perfectly reasonable logical hang up here about the chicken and the egg, and which comes first. And what you just articulated is more akin to historical Arminianism. And I might tilt a little bit more toward historical, reformed thought, what is dead may never live, but the dead can't make itself alive. It has no participation. I mean, there have been moments in my life where I would answer my own question more like, that's a hundred zero. This is one of those crazy moments where that very free will position is on display because it looks like the kid rejects the offer himself like he chose to reject it. And it also looks like that election that God picks, he opens eyes and closes eyes. He opens hearts and shuts hearts and ears. It looks like both of those are on display within like three verses of each other. Absolutely. I guess final question here, my friend, are both true? Yeah. Yeah. So, and I think what you just articulated, I think, is the importance of Scripture that informs theology as opposed to theology that informs Scripture. Because if we're going to look at it with a purely reformed lens, I think there are going to be some things in this passage that we miss. And if we're going to look at it with a purely, as you articulated, Arminian lens, I think there are going to be some things in this passage that we miss as well. So I think in our reading Scripture, we have to listen to the text and we have to really meaningfully encounter the meaningful challenges in the passage. I see Peter saying, what then will we have? It's such a striking question after giving up everything we have. He himself is wrestling with the cost of the sacrifice and what he's going to receive in return. And he himself is coming to terms with... And he's running the equation. Absolutely. Peter, who is a disciple, who is faithful, who is authentic, who has sacrificed, who did with... And who did with... At the gate and all the jokes. Absolutely. You know, he's in a way, you have this interesting parallel of someone who's on the outside of discipleship running the equation and saying the cost is too high and then you have Peter who's on the inside of discipleship running the equation and saying, well, what are we going to get? But both of them are running the same equation and just coming up with a different answer because one of them is inside the process of discipleship and Christianity and one of them is concluded outside that it's too great a cost. And we have to puzzle with and wrestle with and consider and contemplate these areas of Scripture and ultimately see and hear the voice of Christ saying, with man it's impossible. But with God all things are possible. What? Okay, I think we better just roll right on ahead into that verse 27 because I think you're right. I mean, what you're referencing is where the passage goes next. Jesus looks at the disciples after they're like, well, how is this going to work? Like if Larry can't beat that guy up, how can anybody beat that guy up? They ask who then can be saved. And Jesus says to them, with man, this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. And then immediately the next verse is Peter answered him. So this is conversational. It's not like a few weeks later, Peter thought about that and brought this up. Now very next thing Peter answered him and said, we've left everything to follow you. What then will there be for us? This is a blow up meltdown moment, I think, where the emotions are somewhat neutered by the Aramaic and to the Greek, the Greek into the English 2000 years of history, the efficiency of Matthew trying to cram all of this onto one transportable scroll. We don't get all of the passion that was here, but I think the same passion that had Peter hopping out of a boat and walking on water, trying to the same passion that has Peter barking at Jesus. No, no way. I'm never going to let that happen to you. The same passion that has Peter swinging swords around at people's ears a little bit later on has him getting here and being like, dang it. I thought I understood how the deal was. There was some kind of indication that if I gave these things up, I got this other stuff. And if you're telling me that what that guy just did isn't good enough, and that if you're telling me that if this is unachievable apart from God, then wait a dang minute. When do I get my thing? And what do I get? And I'd like for you to please clarify this transaction because I quit my job, dude. I'm married. She's at home right now. I'm hiking around with dudes in some desert headed to a place where you tell me you're about to get killed. What do I get after that? How does it work? Is this a jerk question from Peter? No, it's a completely reasonable question. And it's one of the most profoundly existential questions in all of scripture. He's really asking what's it all for and what's it all about? And for someone who has, as you articulated, made those sacrifices, I would contend it's a perfectly reasonable question to ask. And it's a question that scripture is perfectly sufficient to ask. I think about what Bonhoeffer said. Bonhoeffer, you're talking about the guy, the guy who opposed the Nazis in World War II, the German Lutheran minister who eventually decided he needed to resist what was happening by joining an assassination plot against Hitler. This is Bonhoeffer. Right. And would ultimately himself be killed in the process in his book, The Cost of the Discipleship. He really distills down, I think, to its truest essence what discipleship is. And he says, the call of a disciple is to come and to die, to give up our own ambitions and our own desires and our own view of ourselves and our deservedness and our merits, all in the service of Christ. And what's happening in this passage, I think, is Peter is coming to terms with that. He's settling on to Peter because he obviously has, in his mind, a very clear sense of everything that he's given up. And as he sort of thinks about the future of discipleship, there's not as clear of a sense of everything he's going to get in return. And that's where that question comes from. What then will we have? What they have in Christ is of a much more surpassing value than anything they gave up. That's what the disciple ultimately learns, that what we gain when we gain Christ and accept salvation is what we have and what we gain means more than what we lose. But we don't arrive at that realization without time and tension and frustration. I would say that we don't arrive at that realization without a great deal of doubt and a good combination without these kinds of moments where we think, my God, look at all the things I gave up, look at all the things I walked away from, these kinds of moments that sort of force us to come to ourselves and force us to examine whether or not what we've gained in Christ is worth it. And I think Peter ultimately concludes that it is. Yeah. And I think every authentic disciple ultimately concludes that it is as well. In Acts chapter three, you got one of the early miracles Peter and the disciples when they're still sort of mingled with Judaism and there's a guy who's like, oh, help me, help me. And Peter, he says, I don't have any gold or silver. I don't remember the exact quote. He's like, I got something better than that. And he tells a guy to get up and walk. He imitates the miracles of Jesus in that it's incredible. And so yeah, I mean, we see the guy come around, but there's a lot of steps between Matthew 19 and where his head's at here and the Acts three version of Peter a few years down the road. Well, maybe a year down the road. It's not that far away from. And that really encourages me, Matt, that God is patient with us. That when Peter is running the calculation that God is patient enough with Peter and Christ is patient enough with Peter to basically say in time, you'll understand, you'll stumble, you'll, you'll fall, you'll make mistakes. But in time, you'll come to understand the answer to this question. What then will we have redemption, salvation, eternal life? Well, and Jesus answered this question, didn't he? And Matthew chapter six, with all of the business that he said right in front of Peter already, he's already answered Peter's question. Don't store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust is growing with thieves breaking and steel, but sort of for yourselves, treasures in heaven where moth and rust don't destroy where thieves don't break in and steal for your treasure. Is there your heart will be also nobody can serve two masters. That's right there too. Right. Isn't it? Absolutely. But that's the beauty of this passage, right? That put that existential push and pull within Peter, Christ is constantly saying, hey, here's what you're getting. Here's the perspective that you should have. But Peter is like us. I think William Sanderson says that biblical characters are not models for morality, but they're mirrors for identity. And Peter's like us very much so he needs to be reminded. He needs to be reminded time and time again. But what he's left in his past is not greater than what he'll gain in the future by being a faithful disciple. They're not measurable by the same metrics. Exactly. I mean, we use this language in our conversations here a lot about currencies. You got a currency that works in one place. You cross certain red lines. It doesn't work in the other place. Right. Well, the same seems to be true of world kingdom and kingdom, kingdom. We're going to see a parable later on where Jesus is like, yeah, yeah, use your kingdom resources now for stuff that doesn't go away. You got to convert that world kingdom currency into kingdom, kingdom currency. Right. Because it's like you're just going to die soon and you take none of this with you and it just doesn't matter. I'm coming back to this. I think Peter's our point of view character like you're driving out right now. And as the point of view character, he's asking the question that I think me is the reader that I'm supposed to be asking to. And that is, wait a second, why am I doing this? Am I doing this because of how excited I am about Jesus and God? Or am I doing this because of the opportunity that Jesus and God presents? What is the actual deal here? What's the transaction? What do I get? And if this isn't about me at all, and it's it only possible because of God and it's entirely within the purview of God, then what do I bring to the table? Why would he even bother? If I don't bring anything to the table that he couldn't just call out of non-existence himself with a snap of the fingers, why would he even bother to invite me into his new family of faith? And I think it's okay as we kind of land the plane here, my friend, I think it's okay that by this point in Matthew 19, we have more of a sense of it than we did back in Matthew 5, Matthew 6, but I think it's okay that we don't fully have this nailed down yet either. This question is supposed to be coming more profoundly pregnant, and we're supposed to find this question to be more and more unavoidable. And that's why every time I turn on a microphone and we sit down and we talk right now about what's going on with what Jesus is saying and what the people around him are scratching their heads about, this equation keeps coming up. What does God bring to the table? What do we bring to the table? What's the deal? What's the transaction? It's supposed to be hard, but it's kind of the bajillion dollar question of the whole document for each reader who encounters it. Absolutely. And I think when you say it's supposed to be hard, I think we kind of land at one of the things that's true of Scripture. It challenges us, it challenges us to examine our values and our assumptions and our priorities. It challenges us to examine what is the root system or what motivates our faithfulness and our commitment to God. It challenges us and I'm grateful that it challenges us and that it can withstand our challenging and our examination as well. It's a profoundly durable document. It can handle it. You know, Scripture can handle it. It can handle all of our existential questions and all of our questions about meaning and value and purpose and all of these things. It's sufficient to handle it and to answer it. Before I turn you loose, you just published the book, What's it called and how do people get it? I just published a book. It's called Faces in the Crowd Around the Cross. It's available at gracepublish.org. Really excited about it. So you go there and it just pops right up or you can just search it within that website and find it. You go to gracepublish.org and you click on the menu button in the upper right hand corner and click on the button that says Bookshop. And it's right there. It's available in the hard copy and it's available as a digital download as well. Sweet, man. Well, Daelin Woodall, thank you for your brain. Thank you for your friendship.
