Music by", "url": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/thetenminutebiblehourpodcast/GAL160.mp3"}, "transcription_data": {"text": " There's this theme that runs all through the Gospels and really the whole Bible about the people who don't see well Sometimes in the kingdom being the ones who actually do see well and the people who have it all together being actually Blind and we see that in the book of Matthew with Jesus. I'm turning the page frantically right now Yeah, Matthew chapter 9 it happens more than once Jesus interacts with blind people and there's always this immediate contrast with people who theoretically Can see but they actually maybe can't To me the stuff about Paul in the New Testament gives a real strong hint That something was wrong with his vision. I could be wrong. We're still working that idea through started yesterday We'll keep going today but whether there was something wrong with Paul's vision or Something else was wrong with him. There's definitely a thorn in his side he had some kind of issue that kept him from being a model of peak performance and It bothered him and the Galatian church got an up-close look at what was wrong with him And now Paul is appealing to that here in Galatians 4 as a point of connection between them to remind them of their relationship and to try to Remind them of the trust that they had with each other that points toward the gospel started talking about it yesterday We'll keep talking about it right now after Jeff plays a little bit of music In The book of 2nd Corinthians Paul references something that's been bothering him and he's even asked God Solved he calls it a thorn in the flesh and I think in the Age in which we live I'm gonna be delicate. I know kids listen in the age in which we live There's a certain type of illicit media that is very available to everyone and it's kind of informed Everything like how men think how women act what happens in drama and television There's just sort of a illicit Image of vacation. I'm trying to be gentle of everything that has happened So when you come to a passage like 2nd Corinthians 12 7 It's really easy because of the language in the image ready to be like oh It's it's an addiction to that particular sin of our age that eats so many people's lunches and that casts such an ugly shadow over Culture and human relationships today, but I don't know that I necessarily see that here to me Contextually it reads more like the guy had a physical ailment and it really slowed him down and it made it hard for him to do the things He wanted and he couldn't understand why God wouldn't make him More capable and give him all of his capabilities and capacities To do awesome things for the kingdom at 2nd Corinthians 12 7 to keep me from being Conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations There was given me a thorn in my flesh a messenger of Satan to torment me Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me, but he said to me Do you remember what it says next? This one of those passages that I think It maybe just sticks in people's head a little bit. This is what Paul says the Lord said to him But he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness Therefore I'll boast all more gladly about my weakness so that Christ's power may rest on me That is why for Christ's sake I delight in weakness and insults and hardships and persecutions In difficulties for when I am weak then I am strong Oh, I would Paul be saying that okay You got all the reasons that are right there on the page But maybe another reason Paul would be saying that is because he actually has some data on this It doesn't sound like he had these problems before he met Christ on the road to Damascus I mean you caught that right that to keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations There was given to me a thorn in my flesh It sounds like Paul believes it's from God and it sounds like it happened in his life after he met Jesus on the Damascus road To keep him from thinking he was anything too special Maybe Paul knew that he would get conceited and would be ineffective like like it would be more bad For Paul to have no ailments and be able to attack these missionary journeys and what he wants to do full force Then it would be for him to not have all of his capacities have to depend on other people and have this ailment Maybe even embarrassing ailment that gave him a handicap that made it hard for him to do the things He wanted to do as effectively as he might have otherwise been able to do it But it kept him humble and he viewed it as a gift from God and he chose to thank God for it And he said that for when he's weak he's actually strong So maybe Paul rolls into Galatian territory Which would you know in the axe 13 and 14 accounts this would be Iconium? Lystra Derby and Passidian Antioch maybe a big part of the reason that it worked is that instead of some Amazing and profound looking messenger from the gods with his six foot five 215 pound chiseled jaw appearance instead He's hunched over dude is having to fumble around a little bit because he's having trouble seeing where he's going Maybe instead of him being able to dynamically read things Dramatically in the style of the great orators of the Greeks instead He has to stumble along because it's a little bit hard for him to read things Unless they make giant print scrolls that are special for him in which case he has to fumble around with more scrolls Because it takes more scroll space to read the stuff that other people could read on one scroll It was humbling do whatever the case and it looks like Paul if indeed We're talking about the churches that he met on his first missionary journey early on here in Galatia in acts It looks like Paul is saying that that weakness. He's describing in 2 Corinthians is part of why it worked It's part of what built the connection between these Galatians who've now wandered from the gospel and Paul in the first place As you know It was because of an illness that I first preached to the gospel to you You know in the same way, I don't know exactly what team that soccer player was on Who then defected to a rival team? I can kind of fill in the blanks. I don't need all the details to get the emotional gist in the same way as that here All right, so I don't know exactly what illness I've got my theory. I think it has something to do with his eyes I could be wrong. We'll talk more about that in a minute But he needed treatment or he was in a situation where he was exhausted from going too harder This was the first huge flare up that he's ever experienced with this and it's a deeply humbling moment And where is he when all of this comes to the surface? Apparently he's right there around the Galatians and rather than them turning up their nose at him They minister to him as he ministers to them and something beautiful happens there And it sounds like maybe this church in Galatia or the churches in Galatia Was born out of that very vulnerable Moment even though my illness was a trial to you. You didn't treat me with contempt or scorn Instead you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God is if I were Christ Jesus himself So again, he didn't look like a messenger of the gods, but they received him like one Well, that to me feels like a little bit of a nod to something we get an act as well Remember in chapter 14 when he went to the city of Lystra. That's the city where he would meet his lifelong Friend and protege someone who at the end of his life. He would even call his son Timothy on that visit Paul does miracle he heals a crippled guy who's been lame from birth and immediately the people of Lystra in southern Galatia are like whoa Barnabas is Zeus and Paul is Hermes we need to sacrifice bowls and stuff to them and then Paul Obama's like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa No, you're totally missing the point. That's it's not like this is a different thing You think about like Greek gods and stuff. There's a different thing and then you're all like fine Then we'll just hit you with rocks Jerks if you don't like our sacrifices and Paul this is a town where he looked so dead after that stoning that they dragged his body outside the city thinking he was Deceased and then some Christians come around him and the language is kind of vague. I mean he came back to life I don't know the resuscitated at least and he just goes on doing what he's doing. So in Lystra in Galatia Paul apparently came in and made this great impression and everybody completely missed to the point and attributed pagan deity values to him and then got mad when he wouldn't be their pagan deity in the flesh and tried to kill him I mean my goodness that has biblical parallels with other stuff it is sort of the story of human nature and Human's relationships with celebrity all just kind of in a nutshell right there. It's a very very profound Passage, but then when Paul makes his way to wherever this is these churches or this church in Galatia that he has in mind that he's writing to if this did indeed happen after he got stoned in Lystra I mean, maybe he got hit in the eye a whole bunch Maybe he was just so beat to garbage from that incident that he looked anything like a messenger of a god Nobody at this church was gonna look at him in that condition and think to themselves. Oh, you're probably a Hermes or something No, I mean he looked like a complete mess and even though he was maybe very difficult to Put back together if indeed that is what happened They welcomed him as though he were an angel of God as if he were Christ Jesus himself You see the contrast to me it feels like there's some inside baseball language there Kind of saying you guys remember the whole thing at Lystra or get it with rocks until I basically as far as I could tell I was dead and then I came your way at some point after that and do you remember what you did for me? And how you treated me and the way they mistook me for a messenger? I was not but the way you treated me Rightly as though you really understood who I was and who I represented and what I was here to do Do you guys remember all of these stories that we have together again? I know there's a lot of speculation here that I'm squeezing into this story But in the same way I can understand a very important player being on one team and then moving to a rival team Even if I don't know his name and know nothing about the league So we can kind of piece this together with the details we have and even if it's one of the three or four or five ways We've speculated about here. You can understand how what Paul is saying in this emotional Relational appeal section of Galatians for you can see how that would hit home how that would land I've said it before I'm gonna say it again now. I don't think Paul is off the rails here I don't think he's lost track of his argument. I think he's doing something really intentional He's referencing back to a point of commonality a war story that the Galatians and he have together that pointed them both toward mutual affection and toward the gospel Paul's trying to appeal to that to remind them of that in very Relational terms and with very honest feedback holding up a mirror and We need to explore it a bit more which we're gonna do tomorrow. So I'm gonna pause there We'll pick up where we left off next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
