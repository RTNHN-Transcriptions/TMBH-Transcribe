This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And as promised, we are picking up exactly where we left off yesterday, right after my friend Jeffrey plays some music. Here we go. The rest of eight and nine just keep demonstrating that theme of authority, authority over disease, authority over nature, authority over the spiritual forces of darkness, authority over paralysis. That's the story at the beginning of nine where the guy gets lowered through the ceiling. And you remember the language that he specifically uses there? The teachers of the law are all mad at him because Jesus said he's forgiven as fellows blaspheming. But then Jesus knowing their thoughts says, why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts? And his picture I'm pointing at. Hey, yeah, you guys are over there. So which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or say get up and walk, but so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he looks at the paralytic and he says, get up, take your mat and go home. And the guy does exactly that. And then Jesus chases that by turning right around and wielding more authority to forgive. This time it's not just authority over Jewish regulation and jurisdiction. And like what he demonstrated in forgiving sins here or touching the unclean leper in the previous chapter. Now he's demonstrating authority even over Roman jurisdiction by effectively restoring recruiting and demonstrating authority over a tax collector. Then Jesus demonstrates authority over the disease that causes the woman's bleeding, demonstrates authority over death by resurrecting the dead girl in the house of Jairus. Does it say Jairus and Matthew? I don't remember if it does or not. But I think that's who it is. Then the two blind men right after that call out to him have mercy on a son of David, they won't leave him alone. And what is Jesus ask him? Like, do you believe that I'm able to do this? Yes, or they replied. Then he touched their eyes and said, according to your faith, it will be done to you. Yeah, he has that kind of authority. Really, chapters one through four set up the question of what kind of authority is this that he can do these things, maybe not in the public eye yet. But this is legit historical, big picture authority stuff. The sermon on the Mount frames the question, this is authoritative talk. This isn't a screaming head or a cable news pundit. We're getting something different here. Can he back that up? Does he have the authority to speak in a manner that seems commensurate with such authority? And so then we see his authority over nature and even the rules in eight and nine spelled out. But we're not done with the authority theme yet beginning of chapter 10. He called us all disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and heal every disease and sickness. So we learn in 10 that this authority extends to his ability to commission others into it. And in 11, we see that he not only has the authority to pronounce forgiveness, but he has the authority to pronounce judgment. And he does so against the current generation there, against Corzine, Besseta, Capernaum. These are local communities that had produced people who had come out and bumbled around and said and done dumb stuff that Jesus is judge of everything is within his rights to condemn. And then the end of chapter 11, look at this at that time, Jesus said, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. All things have been committed to me by my father. No one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and those to whom the son chooses to reveal him just in case over the course of eight, nine, 10, and 11. Anybody was looking at that and like, well, where does he get off with all of this authority thing that he's claiming? What's from his father? And he spells that out very explicitly right there. Then he talks about his authority over the Sabbath. He's Lord of the Sabbath. He holds himself out in chapter 12 as having the authority to give or withhold signs. He has the authority to look into the future and tell parables in chapter 13 about how the kingdom is going to unfold. That's effectively, that's how history is going to unfold. And in the face of doubt and disrespect, whether it's from his own family or from his hometown, doesn't matter, his authority isn't a result of things that human authority comes from. It's given to him by his father. It is a different deal. He demonstrates authority over nature by making provisions out of nothingness, feeding 5,000 and then 4,000. The seraphoenician woman or the Canaanite woman in chapter 15, same kind of scenario that we get with the blind guys in chapter 9, she can see what's actually going on, recognizes his authority, uses titles that are indicative of that authority. And to use language that the New Testament and the Old Testament use about Abraham, it's credited to her as righteousness. And that idea of authority and authority that can be given away and commissioned out comes up again in chapter 16, when Peter rightly identifies Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus says, Blessed are you Simon, Son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my father in heaven. And I tell you that you're Peter and on this rock, I'll build my church and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. We did an extensive breakdown of all of the layers of meaning that come with that, but at the most basic level, what is it? As Jesus is saying, I have authority. I have the keys. I can commission you with the authority I've been given. In chapter 17, we see the authority of Jesus as he is transfigured. And as the highest of ranking religious people, saints of the past, are there with him. And Jesus is portrayed as being greater than even Elijah or Moses. In chapter 18, he has the authority to give guidance to his church, his new family of faith that he is creating. In chapter 19, he deftly expresses the limitations of the authority of an earthly prince and earthly king, even with all of their resources. Then starting in verse 20, there's a whole slew of parables over the next several chapters, all of which have the same punchline. The king has authority to do king stuff. The king has authority to forgive, to judge the king has authority to rule. And in chapter 20, when somebody comes and asks to get a chunk of that authority inappropriately and to wield it and hold it almost fully, almost on par with who Jesus is and the authority that he has, that's a no go. When Jesus is coming into Jerusalem in chapter 21, he says, go to the village ahead of you and you'll find a donkey tied there with their cult, untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord needs them and he will send them right away. That is a flex of authority. It's a humble one. It's a subtle one, but it's there. Then Jesus demonstrates that he has authority over all of the social goings ons of the day, just walks in to the temple area and starts flipping over tables. This is my father's house, and this is what I'm going to do. Then when the city loves it and the children are yelling Hosanna to the son of David, a title of authority and the religious leaders are like, you make them stop that. Jesus replies, I mean, I've never read from the lips of children and infants. You have ordained praise. In other words, their acknowledgement of authority is accurate. They are right. Then we get a series of tests of Jesus authority, with little quizzes and riddles and things that are meant to trip him up and none of it works on him. He outmaneuvers a challenge indirectly about paying taxes to Caesar. He outmaneuvers another challenge about the idea of resurrection is being completely laughable. Also, he gets challenged directly on the question of authority. Chapter 21, Jesus entered the temple courts and while he was teaching the chief priests and the elders and the people came to him, by what authority are you doing these things? They asked, and who gave you this authority? Jesus replied, I've read this one so much, and I'm not apologizing for it. I think it's a pivotal passage in the book. And if this one really sticks and it's extra in our hip pocket, like a piece of gum that you had in there, but you forgot and you washed your jeans. And now you're reminded of every time you put your hand in your pocket, that's fine. I want this one to stick. Jesus replied, I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I'll tell you by what authority I'm doing these things. John's baptism. Where did it come from? Was it from heaven or from men? They discussed it among themselves. I don't know how if we say it's from heaven. Then I'll ask them, why didn't you believe them? But if we say for men, we're afraid of the people from they all hold John as a prophet. So they answered Jesus, we don't know. Then he said, okay, either. Well, I tell you by what authority I'm doing these things. Then he gives another parable that indicates the right response to authority. And in that parable, the religious leaders are not responding rightly to the kind of authority Jesus wields. But later on, the way we see the disciples respond in the very end and the women faithfully respond, falling at his feet, worshiping him. They are responding to authority or that level of authority in a way that makes sense that is to measure it with the kind of power and authority we're actually talking about. The give to Caesar passage that I mentioned earlier, I mean, you can't talk about the most powerful position in all of planet earth at that point and have Jesus be so casually dismissive. I don't know. He printed up some money, put his name on it. He's given this little trinket thing that he wants so bad, a lot of paraphrasing there is mine, but I think it's faithful to the meaning of the text. But what about you? Whose image is on you? Well, maybe the same way you're so quick to give deference to this guy who printed up some trinkets. Perhaps you should give deference to the one who printed up you give to Caesar what his Caesar's Jesus says almost dismissively and to God. What is God's Jesus says, acknowledging the authority of God and what the right response to that kind of authority looks like. I thought this one might be a two-parter. It is definitely going to be a three-parter. I'm just going to do the thing again where I hit pause. And we're just going to resume right where we left off tomorrow. Thank you a ton for doing all of this with me. Look at how close we are to wrapping up Matthew. Also real quick, thank you a ton to everybody who's left a review. I cannot stress enough how helpful that is. I mean, the the most meaningful thing you can do to get this in front of other people is to invite somebody to listen to you with you and talk about it together. But the next best thing is to write a review on any and all podcast apps. It is crazy how much those suggestion algorithms really like reviews. I've read a ton of those. Thank you for doing it. Don't feel weird if you haven't done that or that's not your thing. But to those of you who have huge, huge, huge thank you, it means a ton. All right, we're pausing here. We're picking up tomorrow where we left off a mat. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
