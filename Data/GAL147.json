I think it's a great technique for telling people a difficult thing or for being told a difficult thing because it puts it all in perspective. It reminds you that there's a whole bunch of good stuff, but there's just some stuff we got to work on right here in the middle. Are you familiar with the idea of the turd sandwich? I think we've talked about it before. We probably heard of the turd sandwich. You probably have been on the receiving end of the turd sandwich and you've probably dealt out a few turd sandwiches in your life. The principal goes like this. You got, you know, a sandwich. You get the bun on the top and you get the bun on the bottom in the middle. You have whatever you filled your sandwich with. If there's a difficult conversation to be had, sometimes a good way to handle it is to remind people of something good. This is going great. This is awesome. Wonderful. Now here's the difficult thing. That's the turd sandwich part that's apart in the middle, the undesirable part. But what happens next? There's more delicious fun. Here's some other great things that are going on. And I understand fully that there are going to be some of you who are like, I don't like that beating around the bush. Just don't give me the turd sandwich. Hit me with the thing. Let me get on with it. But deep down, I think most of us like the turd sandwich because it's really nice to be reminded that in the grand scheme of things, a lot is going right here. We just got this one thing that we need to work on. I've been reading this book of Galatians here for the last however many months, hanging out with you, working on it. We're through three chapters. We're into the fourth chapter. We just did two giant side quests because I'm into those. We did one on how the clothing makeeth the man and the motif of being robed in the righteousness of God throughout the whole Bible. We did one on that arc because there's this language about how if you were baptized into Christ, you have clothed yourselves with Christ. So we did that whole big arc at the end of chapter three in the beginning of chapter four. We did another whole big side quest arc on the idea of the fullness of time in the Bible. And you know what? Sometimes if you stack up a whole bunch of arcs, you can get a little disorienting. This is turd sandwich conversation is about reorienting to what's going on in the big flow of this book. So we're through three chapters. We're getting into the fourth chapter. And the more I look at Galatians, the more what I'm seeing here is sort of a disproportionate turd sandwich where Paul is going to lead with some nice things, some good things. Then he's going to get into some very difficult things because Galatians is at its heart a corrective letter from an authority figure, two people under his care who are blowing it. But as we pivot from somewhere in the middle of chapter three on toward the end, there's a lot more bun. There's a lot more good stuff. Thus the turd sandwich again, a very weird dis sheveled, disproportionate turd sandwich where the bun on the top is more like a tortilla. It's very, very thin. It's very, very quick. We get past that very quickly and we get into the third part. And then the bottom of it, you know, that's bigger and fluffier like Texas toast. That is a, that's an odd visual. But here we are. So before we dig deeply into all that's going on here in the beginning of chapter four and some very loaded language that Paul is using and I think maybe drawing on Greek philosophy and other ancient ideas about the nature of reality and the world for people who know God and for people who don't before we get into all of that, let's just step back for a minute and make sure that we're all on the same page and we're seeing this whole Galatians thing for what it is. The letter starts off very nice. This is the tortilla on top of the turd sandwich. Paul an apostle sent not from men nor by men, but by Jesus Christ and God the father who raised him from the dead and all the brothers with me to the churches in Galatia. Grace and peace to you from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age. According to the will of God our father to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. Beautiful. The whole message of hope is in there. The message of the gospel is in there. A reminder of how they all became Christians and what they believed in the first place is in there. A reminder of Paul's authority is in there. It's a lovely little tortilla of deliciousness before we get into the turdi middle part, which isn't really turdi at all. It's beautiful and important theology. It's just relationally it comes as a corrective. I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel, which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach the gospel other than the one we preach to you, let him be eternally condemned. Now we've got our arc for this whole middle part of the turd sandwich. People came and messed with these Galatians who were new in their faith. They had received Christ. Everything was working, but some people came up for whatever reason and gave them a different version of the gospel. And now these churches were these poor Galatians if they're all confused and they don't know what to make of it. And now Paul is going to write this letter to get things straightened out. It's going to be read in front of everybody and it is going to create a socially awkward scene as the interlopers who brought this extra gospel, this other teaching that is antithetical to Jesus. They're going to be in the room. The people who fell for it are going to be in the room, the squishy middle who just wanted to make everybody happy and tried to believe all of it at once. They're going to be in the room and the people who held firm and were like, no, I think you guys are outsiders. And that's not the message of God that we received when this all started. They're going to be in the room. Weird, weird, weird. Paul knows that. And it's all coming through in this letter. Paul spends the rest of chapter one and a good chunk of chapter two defending his own authority to say these things, to even be writing this letter because what would you do if you had an organization and some people had come in and the organization had kind of morphed. And now people believe slightly different things. And then somebody from back in the past came in and was like, it ought to be this way. Well, if you're part of team change, you're going to be like, who's that guy? Who cares about his dumb opinions? Whatever. It is news. Who cares? He's just making stuff up. Now things are better. We're getting stuff straightened out. You would just dismiss it. So it might seem at first glance as you and I as outsiders are reading through Galatians, eavesdropping on this letter. And I feel like, wow, Paul, it's pretty self centered. That's a lot of time on your own resume and your own authority. I'm not sure I like that. But when you think about what's going on and you put yourself in the shoes of people at that church, you get why Paul would offer this defense. Also as we look closely at Galatians one and two, what we see as his defense is overwhelming lead to the praise of God saying, all of this is from God. All of this is the work of God. And even though my resume is really good, you don't even actually have to take my word for it. Go and talk to all the other people who were there. Go and talk to the other apostles. Go talk to the really big, powerful, important people with great reputations back in Jerusalem. They're signing off on what I'm saying. I went out with the same message they're going out with. So he's doing this big, broad reconstruction of the whole authority of everything and really trying to kind of lock things down and be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Christianity, the following of Christ is not going to be some meandering thing where we just make up a billion different beliefs vaguely related to Jesus. And it can go any number of a billion different enormously self conflicting ways. No, there is a true heart to this message that is the true gospel. And it's not arguable. It's not negotiable because it's not from man. It's from God. So that's what we get in the first chapter and a half. Then we get a very specific example when we get into chapter two, still dealing with this theme of what is the message that they have strayed from and what is the message that Paul has rightly brought? What's the authority behind it? And to further make the point that this message is from God and that even very good people could get fouled up in this thing for a minute and get it wrong, he brings up an example of Peter getting it wrong and Antioch and Paul had to oppose him to his face. And the error Paul says that Peter was making and here we kind of get the shift in the letter into the real substantive material of Paul's critique of this church. Paul says the error that Peter was making implicitly is that he was trying to have it both ways. He was trying to somehow seek right standing with God through the old ethnic associations of the Jewish people from his ancestry and also from adherence to the law. But then Paul really starts to drill this argument starting at the end of chapter two and really running all the way to the end of the book, but all the way through chapter three. He's pounding the point that the law of the Old Testament was never designed to give right standing with God. If right standing with God was ever to be achieved Galatian church, it was to be achieved by the grace of God and by believing God. Just like the father of the entire Jewish race, Abraham himself had happened in his life. Abraham was the man of faith. He believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness. So Paul is going to keep appealing back to that for the Jews in the room in these Galatian churches and for the Gentiles in the room to be like, it's not like we have a new religion here. It's not like we have a new thing that's happening. The law was a tutor. It was a trainer and in the same way that a prince of a kingdom or a noble estate doesn't get the keys to the kingdom right away off the bat. They are subject to a lot of rules. They have a tutor and a trainer and it's difficult and it's rigorous in those early years of the kid era of that kid's life. Well, so it was with us. The law was our tutor, our trainer. It served great purposes and that it reveals a character of God. It still serves a great purpose in revealing the character of God. It still serves a great purpose in revealing the wantingness of man that we can't handle our own business, the sinful state of humanity, the hopeless, cursed state of humanity apart from God. But Paul argues through Galatians chapter three that kid era was never the end game. The end game was the air, H E I R era era after the kid receives the difficult tutelage and lives subject to that. The kid grows up and becomes a participant in the household. His ownership in the household is identified as a son, a daughter of the king is clothed in the noble garb of the king and he used Paul's language are recognized as heirs according to the promise. So what Paul is saying through Galatians chapter three theologically is this that as long as the air is a child, he's no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. He's subject to the guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. So also when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world. But when the time had fully come, God sent his son, born of a woman, born under the law to redeem those under the law that we might receive the full rights of sons. And that takes us up to Galatians four, verse five, which is basically where we're at. I couldn't tell you exactly where we pivot from the meaty middle turd part of all of this and move into the big giant Texas toast bottom of the turd sandwich, which is really fun and good because there is a tone of correctness through all of the book of Galatians. And it is going to get pretty harsh again, especially toward the outsiders, the interlopers who came and tried to cut the Galatians off from the right relationship with God. It's I mean, it's going to get pretty harsh toward them again later on. So the turd sandwich analogy doesn't work perfectly. Maybe it's like a big Mac where you get the extra layer of bread in the middle. I don't know whatever it's breaking down a bit at this point. However, what I'm driving at is at the beginning, you can see that Paul at the front end of this letter, he's hopping mad. He barely gets through this super thin, super quick restatement of the gospel, grace and peace to you. And then boom, he is into the war path. This is not the faith handed down to you. You're getting it wrong. You are misunderstanding what God was doing in the Old Testament with the law and what God is doing now. These two things are working together in harmony through the fullness of time and Christ represents a change. It represents the high point of the plan, the pivot point in the plan. The law has done what it was supposed to do. Excellently, Christ has done what he's supposed to do flawlessly, perfectly. And the right response for that Galatians is to put your hope in Christ to have faith and join Abraham as the man of faith. And in doing so, the righteousness of God is imparted to us. You cannot achieve that simply by doubling and tripling and quadrupling down on human effort to try to obey the law, to do so is to misunderstand the point of the law and to misunderstand the point of Christ and to misunderstand the whole arc of God's grand redemptive plan.
