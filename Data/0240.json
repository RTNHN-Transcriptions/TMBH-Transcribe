This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And as we've discussed before, I'm in avid almost to the point of being unhealthy Denver Broncos football fan. And the Broncos, if you know anything about the National Football League or American football, have this one character who looms large over all of Bronco's history moving forward. And this is John Elway. He's a great quarterback who led the team to multiple Super Bowl appearances and eventually a couple of Super Bowl wins right before he walked away and retired from football, winning two straight championships. That's just amazing, right? And since then, though it is not a spoken prophecy, there is this almost prophetic-like belief amongst Bronco's fans that there is going to be another Elway, that at some point a youngster is going to rise up and demonstrate that he has the same leadership chops and the glory of old will be restored and it's going to be great. And Peyton Manning came along. He's another great quarterback that the Broncos rented late in his career for four years. He was awesome to watch. But since he retired after winning another championship, just got to mention those and if you're lucky enough to have him, you got to talk about them. And since Peyton Manning retired after his brief tenure with the Broncos, the team has had nine different starting quarterbacks. And very quietly and sometimes loudly, fans and analysts wonder, is this next one maybe Elway? And they go out and they play and you look and you're like, is this the one who is chosen? No, no. Look at what he's doing. That's not, no, that's not what a successful Hall of Fame quarterback would do. That's dumb. Let's try out the next one and you just cycle through all of these candidates to be the next coming of the great John Elway, the quarterback that will lead the Broncos back to glory. Do I even need to say likewise, I feel like this one is just so obvious. Can I say it anyway? I'm going to do it. Likewise in Matthew chapter 11, we're now a third of the way through Matthew and the audience is along for the ride. If they're still even reading at this point, which I think they would be, I've found it interesting, they would be reading still because there's a possibility that Jesus is the one who is to come is the predicted one who's going to lead everything back to glory or a newfound glory that is better and different and more right and then holy and redeeming than anything we've ever seen before. Maybe by the time we get to chapter 11, the original audience is starting to allow themselves to hope because this is a bigger deal than just maybe this guy would be a good religious person in the mind of the original audience and in my mind, Jesus, the Messiah would be the one who would fix everything. The stakes are very high. But the interesting thing is you've got this character who we hung out with like 150 episodes ago, maybe more, John the Baptist and John the Baptist is predicted in the Old Testament. He's this guy who is related. He's a cousin of Jesus of Nazareth and it's his job to come before Jesus and play with the point people toward him. He's the voice of this one crying out in the wilderness, make straight the paths for the Lord. And there's this whole religious revival that happens before Jesus is ever on the scene. And it's all led by John the Baptist who lived a life of rejection, of worldly possessions and wealth and comforts. And some people even believe that because of his lifestyle, he might have been associated with the Essenes who had the Qumran community where the Dead Sea Scrolls got discovered that we talked about over on the YouTube channel. Whatever the case, John is out in the desert, Northern Dead Sea, Jordan River area. And that's a long walk for people to go from the civilized parts to go out there and hang out with him. But people keep doing that. And some people who come out and get baptized by him and listen to his teachings never go home. They became John's disciples. Now John was not the object of worship at any point as best as we can tell. I was pointing people to God. He was calling people to repentance. And you and I remember what his message was because he said it and then Jesus immediately said it. And then Jesus repeated it when he sent out the disciples with it in Matthew chapter 10. It's the kingdom of heaven is near. Now John specifically emphasized repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And then people come out and they're like, well, what do you mean by repent? And you remember this from Matthew chapter three? Sounds like, well, if you're doing this weird thing, knock it off. And if you're doing that, you probably ought to do that. And if you're this person, you probably ought to be doing this. And it looks like a lot of people probably turned and walked away and discussed, but a lot of people stuck with it and they went home and their lives were changed or they stayed out there and they added to this group of disciples that were wandering around in the desert, not with Jesus, but with his cousin, John the Baptist. Now to go back to our analogy, pretty much nobody other than a few fringe outsiders and confused members of the Herod family suspected that John was the return of John. Oh, wait, the promised one who would come and make everything right. People were reading what John was saying pretty clearly because remember part of John's message was, whoa, and Amy, there's another one who's coming whose sandals. I'm not even fit to untie. I baptize you with water. He's going to baptize you with the Holy Spirit. But John was never, ever cool with people signing up to worship him or imagine that he would be the fulfillment. He was clear on his role and he pointed people to Jesus. So John then cannot be lumped in with the desert messianic claimants that were popping up all over the place around this time. He's something different and he went out of his way to make sure that people understood that. So in Matthew 11, we run into a bewildering passage. It looks like John, whose entire purpose in life, his entire point for his existence is to know the Christ when he sees the Christ and point people to the Christ. It looks like he's not totally sure if Jesus is the Christ. Let's just read the passage and we'll break it down. So 11, 1, after Jesus had finished instructing his 12 disciples, he went out from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. Okay, we covered that. Everybody's filtering back in from their great big trip. And now it says, when John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him, are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else? Okay, one. Oh yeah, also I need to tell you, John's in prison now and he's going to be in prison for the rest of the document. All of the synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke handle the John prison thing in kind of a goofy way. Mark gives us just this little nugget about, you know, we're rolling right along. I think it's right in Mark chapter one. And then all of a sudden John's just, oh yeah, by the way, in prison. Verse 14, after John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee and you back up, you know, there's no other indication that John was put in prison, which means that Mark assumed everybody knew that John got arrested or he would have given more context to that. Matthew writing to a very Jewish audience must have also assumed that everybody was really clear on what happened with John because he intersperses it a little bit as well. Matthew four, right after we come back from the temptation, Jesus comes back to the news that John has been put in prison. When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee leaving Nazareth, da, da, da, da, fulfilled some stuff and that's how that worked out. So for both Matthew and Mark, it's kind of this passing mention and then Luke touches on the whole John is in prison thing, you know, weird chronological aside that harkens back to the out of order storytelling of Memento or the usual suspects. You're rolling along with the baptism of Jesus and all of this teaching repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Oh, what should we do? And John's telling like, hey, if you got too tunic, share one of them and tax collectors like, well, what should we do? And John's like, well, this is quite a rip and people off. Taking all their money is stupid and mean. And then some soldiers like, well, what should we do because the kingdom of heaven is at hand and he replies to them, you know, don't rip people off, don't take their money and don't accuse people falsely, be content with your pay. And everybody's excited and expectant and Jesus is there. And then in verse 19, it just completely jumps to, but when John rebuked Herod, the Tetraark because of Herodias, his brother's wife and all the other evils, things that he had done, Herod added this to the mall. He locked John up in prison. When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized. Oh, wait, John baptized Jesus. Ah, so that whole thing I just read you in verses 19 and 20 isn't aside chronologically that was filling in for the reader details. They already knew everybody knew John got arrested. Everybody knows that John's fate is that he got beheaded by Herod. Everybody knew that John called out something about the Herod family. Luke gives us a few more details. It's this weird half incestuous divorce remarry wife swap thing that he was doing that maybe we'll spend more time on some other time. So all three of the synoptic gospels, let us know that casually John just got arrested in here somewhere. Matthew 11 has John's disciples who are now just free radicals floating around out there somewhere in the desert. They don't know what to do next. Do we point people to Jesus? I guess that's what our master was doing. We should probably do that too if that was his quest. Well we just better make sure that Jesus is the actual one. I mean, John cheated a little bit and knew that Jesus was the actual one because they met one time when they were both not born yet and like kicked and stuff. And that was enough for him to have confirmation, but I wasn't there, not yet born. So I don't know. And Steve, you weren't there either. So here's what we're going to do. We're just going to go and look up Jesus. He's out and about anyway. And we're just going to be like, Hey, we just want to know for sure. Are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else? There are two ways that we can take this. One is what the heck? Come on, John. You don't have them briefed for this. What do you have them briefed for? This is awful. But I think the other way that we can take it is with a little bit of empathy. I've never been arrested and knew that I would never see the light of day again and that eventually I was going to probably get beheaded or hung. I've never felt that before. So I don't know what that despair is like, but I do know that under much lighter difficulties, I have gone to dark places in my faith and my hope and like, Oh, some people said some mean things about me at church. I just don't know what to do next. And that's nothing people say mean things sometimes. Who cares? Oh, stuff's a little tight financially. My faith. I mean, we're weak. John is not. This guy's been tough as nails throughout. He's done his job consistently. Now he's kind of out of the game because he's getting starved to death in some cell. And so I guess it might be understandable that he might waver or wobble a little bit in this isolated setting where he's going to struggle. It makes sense that his disciples would waver or wobble a little bit because they don't know where the thing goes next. I really don't have that big a problem, even though they've seen all this stuff, all this great teaching, all the miraculous things, even though that's there, I still think and people are human. Faith is hard. It's okay that it's hard. And Jesus is never terribly mean to people who are like, I really want to make sure I get this right. Are you the one? His response to these guys is something we're going to break down moving forward against the backdrop of Jesus being patient with people who would like to believe and get it right, but are wobbling. And Jesus readily affirming people who get it right, even though it seems like they shouldn't have been able to get it right and recognize him as the king. Online, everybody in Bronco's country is waiting for the second coming of John Elway. And every time you see somebody who sort of meets the qualifications, you got to ask and scrutinize, but you don't want to jump at it too quick. Likewise in Matthew 11, everybody's looking for the Messiah. Everybody can't wait for this thing to happen and for it to be real. But a lot of people have said, I'm the Messiah. It's me over here. And so okay, here are some people who've been waiting a long time too. And it looks like they want to make real sure before they go and throw all of their weight and energy behind this. I'm Matt.
