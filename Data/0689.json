This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and a huge welcome to everybody who's on the newer side. Those of you who just jumped in here recently, thank you for giving this a go. I know it's a really well established podcast, not like, well established like aren't we fancy, but well established like we've just been doing this for a while and we're quite a ways into the book of Matthew. And I understand it could be intimidating to feel like you're jumping in the middle of that. It's awesome that you're here regardless of where you're coming from, what you think about the Bible God, Christianity, any of that business. This is a conversation that is inclusive of tons of people coming from different places on those particular questions. If you want to and you are new here, you're always welcome to go back to the beginning and just power through it and catch up. But hopefully you can jump in here and get good things out of it and piece it together as we go along as well, whatever the case. Hey, for those of you who've been here forever, I love that. Thank you for those of you who have just joined and from the looks of things a lot of you have here in the last few weeks. Wonderful. That is super exciting. I'm glad we all get to hang out together and do this. We are in Matthew chapter 26, which is right toward the end of the book of Matthew. And we just experienced the story, the tragic story of Jesus being arrested in the garden of Gethsemane. And now it looks like he's going to face some trumped up charges. And if you're familiar with anything about planet Earth that all you know that he's headed to the cross where he is going to be executed. And in the meantime, we pick it up with this verse right here, right after Jesus got arrested. Matthew 26, 57, it says, those who arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. Now, for those of you who've been doing this with me for a while, you're like, huh, well, there goes the rest of our day because we're going to spend a talking about Caiaphas, aren't we? As a matter of fact, my friends, we are for those of you who are new. Sometimes we get further than one verse in a day. You know, it just kind of depends. But anytime we have a chance to go and dive in a little bit to the history of certain things that go beyond the biblical account and that we can compare notes with in the extra biblical historical world, I like to take the opportunity to do it in this Caiaphas guy is super, super interesting. Archaeology and history from the larger world and their relationship with the Bible, it's a really interesting thing. There's a pattern that kind of repeats where stuff that's in the Bible, people might be like, well, you know, I don't know about the details there for sure. People might raise some questions about that, but then things come up archaeologically and pretty much without fail. It's always like, oh, okay, well, it turns out the Bible, whether you believe the stuff about God or not, you got to admit it was set in a real time in a real place with real people, real names. Everybody and everything is where it's supposed to be in the 66 books of the Bible that most of you would have sitting in front of you. There were questions about a particular governor named Surgius Paulus who comes up in passing in the book of Acts. I'm like, I don't know. Is the timeline exactly right there? Well, then somebody later finds a rock and the rock is right where it's supposed to be and it dates to exactly the right moment. It says Surgius Paulus right on it. It's like, oh, okay. Well, I guess that was that guy. This high priest, Kiaethis though, he's a little different animal in terms of being historical character because he's all over the New Testament. He's in the book of Matthew. He comes up in the book of John. He comes up in the book of Acts. I'm probably forgetting some stuff, but he's very well attested to. We know a lot of details about his life there. Well, we also know details about his life that line up very, very neatly with the biblical account from a very prominent first century AD historian named Josephus. He was a Jewish guy. He was very interested in the history of the Jewish people, but he also to save his own skin partnered up with the Romans. And so he's writing this larger history of his people for an audience beyond his own people. He does a lot of explain it to me like I'm five stuff and we get a lot of details. Probably at the time I was like, yeah, we all know. We totally all know, but that for us looking back through the lenses of history and through the fog of 2000 years of history, we're like really grateful that he wrote all of this stuff down. So the things that the Bible tells us about Kiaethis and that we know about Kiaethis from extra biblical early sources, contemporary sources even is that his father in law was another high priest. The guy named Anas and this high priest role was one that in a way could really be traced back all the way to the book of Exodus. Now we've talked before about how the role of high priest evolved and changed and it was disrupted and some things happened. But effectively, this is the guy who is at the head of the religious leadership. He is performing the role of go between between God and man. So this is a little bit awkward because the Messiah pretty evidently the Bible is holding out Jesus as being. Well, his job is to be the mediator between God and man. So now I guess we have two mediators between God and man. This could get uncomfortable and it does in particular for Jesus who gets crucified, which is the uncomfortable part that I was referencing. Kiaethis by all accounts was a crafty politician who was caught between a rock and a hard place. He had to keep Rome happy because the entire temple system, the entire religious system he was head over only existed at the good pleasure of Rome who had a foreign policy of conquering people and then letting them pseudo govern themselves because they felt like they could get more peace and more taxes out of conquered people. If those conquered people still felt like they got to be like themselves mostly and didn't have to be like Romans in every way, but they would have Roman governors who would oversee certain regions and those Roman governors held the power to appoint key ethnic rulers for those conquered people. So in the case of Judea, the Roman governor would have the authority to appoint a high priest. It's pretty weird. That's not really who you want to do that. I mean, that would be like Donald Trump or Barack Obama or Joe Biden getting to pick like I don't know who the president of your denomination is or who the next pope is going to be or who the pastor of the local mega church. I guess just, I mean forever. Imagine going to that church. He would feel like this guy's a little bit compromised, but he's all we got and okay. So this is different than the historical priesthood. It's an awkward situation and Kyapha says father in law, a guy named Anis, A N N A S. Am I spelling that right? I'm pretty sure I'm spelling that right. A N N A S. I think that's correct. I mean, you can see why I'm trying to make sure I get it right. I mean, just listen to the name. It's when you just if you get it, you get it. I'm sorry. I'm trying to be tasteful. So, Anis ruled from, well, ruled is too strong a word. He was the high priest up until 16 A D. So, I don't know, 14, 15 years before the events that we're reading about right now in Matthew 26. And then some other guy was in there for a little while. I don't remember how he ran afoul of the people who were in charge, but after some other guy who was in there, his name escapes me, then Kyapha was appointed high priest by the Roman governor, Valerius Graddis. So that means that Kyapha's would have become high priest around 18, 19 A D. And I'm sure that is Googleable, but I didn't. So let's just say that that is about right. Even though Kyapha isn't really on screen until Matthew chapter 26, he is casting a long shadow throughout the whole thing. Contemporary readers of the book of Matthew would have known who Kyapha's is. In terms of high priests, he would be the Queen Elizabeth or Elizabeth I or Queen Victoria, very long standing, famous ruler whose era was so defined by him that everybody knows who that guy is and what he was about and what it felt like when he was in charge. Kyapha's was not some forgettable dude who was just in and out of the role very, very quickly. Kyapha's would be remembered as like the epitome of the guy trying to thread the needle between I guess I started to say this earlier, but didn't round it out. This is the rock in the hard place thing that I forgot to complete. Here it is. He was trying to thread the needle between the Roman occupiers and all the people who wanted to get rid of the Roman occupiers, especially the zealots, one of whom was a direct disciple of follower of Jesus. He got the people who want a violent revolution to get rid of Rome so they can establish a kingdom and get things cooking again so that the promises of God can be fulfilled and they can self govern. And then you've got the people whose entire position depends on the proliferation of the Roman occupation. Because remember, Kyapha's wasn't appointed by the zealots who wanted to get rid of Rome. Kyapha's wasn't appointed by a bunch of church people who just loved the Lord and just wanted to put their heads together and get the best guy in there to really reach people and serve God and serve others. That wasn't the plan. He was a political appointee who owed his political loyalty to Rome. So the point of all of that is even though Kyapha's isn't on screen until the very end of Matthew, everybody knows that he is the big power, the kingpin. He is the head, the champion, the big boss of all of the people who were opposing Jesus. All of the people are presented as being the bad guys. They all answer to him. He's in charge of the cabal. I got a lot more I want to do on this Kyapha's thing. These historical deep dives, they get this way. We do this from time to time where we go look at history stuff and talk about these characters and I'm never satisfied to cover it in one conversation. So we're just going to hit time out. This is what that sounds like. These are my hands. Can you hear it? Making that time out thing. Two of them. I actually heard a little bit. I went a bit too hard. We're going to pause there and we're going to pick it up and talk more about Kyapha's next time around. Appreciate you. A mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
