I understood my parents didn't really have much in the way of money back then. Sharing vehicles. My younger sister was driving by then and my little brother was going to start driving soon. Yeah, they can't just be throwing cars around willy nilly to every single kid who goes to college. Times were tight. So I didn't get a car. They also told me, you don't need a car. Look at this beautiful campus. You're going to here on the north shore of Chicago. There's so much to do here. All the students are here. Just be here and be present. And they were right. That was absolutely the right call. I met my wife on my first day in my first class. I met a whole bunch of friends in the first couple of days just moving in and they were absolutely right. It was great to just be there and be present. But sometimes you want to go do stuff. I mean, you're in Chicago and I had one friend. We all had one friend who had an automobile. His name was Bill and Bill drove a Ford Fiesta. It wasn't terribly nice. It had tiny little tires. We're skinnier. I mean, it was almost like bike tires on this thing. It was an ultra compact car and it had blue and pink lines, mauve lines painted on the side. They were kind of curly and decorative. I think maybe this is what the good people at Ford back then. Imagine that a Mexican Fiesta color palette might look like. So like Taco Bell colors from the 90s. I don't know. I didn't care because it rolled and it got places. It had a gas pedal and it had brakes and you could sit in it and it would move you at high speed from one place to another. And you know, those Chicago roads and everything are a little bit stressful. But so what? It worked. And also we're all kids and we're not thinking about any of that stuff. So it worked. Well, then sophomore year comes around and some more people have vehicles now and whenever we go somewhere as a group, you all decide who's going to drive what then junior year comes around and now people are starting to get kind of nice vehicles that their parents are giving them and stuff. And we decide where we're going to go and what would happen is everybody inevitably, you know, would start volunteering to drive or whatever. And Bill would be like, I'll drive. But then people who used to love to ride in the Ford Fiesta suddenly were making up excuses about how they don't want to ride in it anymore. They're like, Oh, you know, safety wise, it doesn't really have enough seat belts. I'm just concerned. Did it have analog brakes? I mean, the weather being the way it is and what not. You frauds. That car was absolutely fine for you two years. You don't care about analog brakes. What are you talking about? You just want to ride in Kyle's car because it's brand new Mustang and it looks way cooler, which is completely defensible. But just don't hit me with this fake stuff about being too good for the Ford Fiesta because you weren't too good for it two years ago. If you had problems with the safety standards on the Ford Fiesta, you should have brought that up two years ago, but you didn't because it was the only option and deep down in your heart of hearts. You thought it was absolutely fine. And this is all perfectly logical to you because you can see all of the psychology and everything that's going on here. Likewise, the Apostle Paul brings up a buddy and a traveling companion of his named Titus in Galatians chapter two. And in this metaphor, Titus is Bill's Ford Fiesta Paul and Titus, they had all kinds of adventures and travels together and Titus was rock solid, absolutely reliable. There's a book of the Bible named after him and Titus went with Paul to Jerusalem on one of these trips. And apparently Titus, and if you didn't catch this already, that's a very Gentile name. I mean, Titus ironically is the name of one of the two guys, him and Vespation, who would destroy the temple in Jerusalem just a few years after the writing of the book of Galatians. So it's a very Gentile name and Titus went to Jerusalem and apparently he met with both of these two camps from the Jerusalem squad, those who were inclined to support Paul in saying, yeah, the gospel is just for the Gentiles and they don't probably really need to do anything except Jesus, you know, bend the knee to Christ as Lord and move forward. But Titus also apparently met with a bunch of the Jewish Christians who later came up to Galatia and caused these problems in these churches because they wanted all of the Gentile Christians to get circumcised. And remember Titus is a Gentile Christian. So think about what a weird trip that must have been for him. You go to Jerusalem, this foreign, everything smells different. The food is different. You're from a totally different culture. And on top of that, everybody's constantly pestering you and wanting to know the status of your genitalia. You saw you, you're from Greece then? Yeah, yeah, man. Is it nice up there? That's just, yeah, it's absolutely beautiful. They got a lot of olive oil, right? Yeah, really, like the most extra virgin olive oil is really, it's really great. That's awesome. That's awesome. Got your foreskin on there. What now? I mean, really weird trip for this guy, but it seems like Titus endured it very dutifully. And it would seem that all of the Christian leaders from generation one, the original followers of Jesus, they didn't bring anything up. They didn't have any complaints about Titus. It didn't come up at the Jerusalem Council. They weren't like, Hey, you know, just like one other quick note, you're going to need to get circumcised or you're not a real Christian. I mean, in fact, the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15 with Titus in the room ruled in the opposite direction. You remember the findings of the Jerusalem Council, right? And Titus, remember he's here for all of this. Let's just review it real quick. Acts 15, so men came down from Judea to Antioch and we're teaching the brothers. Unless you're circumcised, according to the custom top I Moses, you can't be saved. Most brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed along with some other believers. We learned later that that was Titus to go up to Jerusalem, see the apostles and the elders about the questions of the church and Antioch to send them out. They go and they travel there and the apostles and elders met to consider this question in Jerusalem. This is all Acts 15. And then after a bunch of discussion, Peter gets up and he's like, Hey, your brothers, you know, a lot of some time ago, God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips, the message of the gospel and believe. God who knows the heart showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them just as he did to us. He made no distinction between us and them for he purified their hearts by faith. Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples, a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? No, we believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that they were saved just as we are. And then the whole assembly became silent. They listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done on the proof of journey, the first missionary journey, probably where the Galatian church got established. When they finished, James spoke up, brothers, listen to me. Simon, it's Peter, has described us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles of people for himself. And then he quotes some stuff from the Old Testament and he says, it's my judgment, therefore, that we shouldn't make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. Instead, we should write to them telling them to abstain from food, polluted idols, from sexual immorality and from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. It might seem like a weird list to you, but that was the list I talk about it in another series somewhere. If you want to know more about it. Then the apostles and the elders of the whole church decided to choose some of their own men to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas to paraphrase his mind, share the good news about this resolution and let them know that, hey, we're moving forward. This is great and this is exciting. That's it. That's what happened at the Jerusalem Council. Well, there were two parties at the Jerusalem Council from Jerusalem. You caught that, right? There were the people who went through everybody into confusion who caused problems in Antioch. These were Jewish Christians were like, Hey, you're not Christians unless you're circumcised. We're coming up to them in Antioch and be like, Oh, you're Christian. I'm a Christian too. I'm Barnacles and I'm testicles and we're two very Greek people with very Greek names and we're not circumcised at all. And we're also Christians. Bring it in. This is a big Greek hug pops of clays. Bring it in over here. We're like, we're all hugging with the Jewish and the Jewish Christians in this hypothetical situation. We're like, no, we're not doing any hugs because you're not real Christians because of your genital status. You are not circumcised. You get out of here. You fake. You're not even real. This is stupid. And so then up in Antioch, they're like, well, we got to do something about that. And so they have the Jerusalem Council. The Jerusalem Council rules unequivocally in favor of Paul and Barnabas and the Antioch church and Peter and James. Everybody's on the same page. There's no debate. There's not even really any compromise. And so in the room here are generation one of the disciples at this point, all of whom, but what James, is it still alive? There's James. Yeah, James would have been executed already by this point by Herod. So pretty much all of them would have been there at this point. And then also in the room are the agitators. I don't know what else to call them. The times they get called the Judaizers. These are the people who went to Antioch and caused the problem in the first place for barnacles and testicles and popsicles and said that you guys aren't Christians because you're not circumcised. And this same ilk after presumably the Jerusalem Council is like, well, we'll just go a little further out. We'll go further afield and they go against the wishes of the Jerusalem Council and travel all the way up to Galatia, probably if I've got my timeline, right? And they pick the same fight there, hoping they'll get away with it for them. It's just what is your weird obsession with this? You guys are being super, super weird about things and culty. And so now Paul in Galatians two, which it occurs to me that I've still not read to you at this point, Paul comes back at them and is like, Hey, do you remember when the metaphorical Ford Fiesta that is Titus came down to the Jerusalem Council and we put him right in front of all of the generation one of the Christian leaders, all of the big pillars of the faith and nobody had any problems with him then. Nobody was like, Oh, you know, the tires aren't thick enough. That's not safe enough. I don't like the painted Mexican Taco Bell stripes on the side. That's no good at all. He's not circumcised. What's he doing here in this meeting? James didn't say anything fussy like that. Peter didn't say anything fussy like that. In fact, they said the exact opposite. It was you guys who were putting all kinds of pressure on him on just a simple vacation, like a work trip. You're putting all this pressure on him to make part of his work trip agenda being adult circumcised. You guys don't think that's a little bit weird and a little bit pushy and you push that agenda out in front of everybody, all of Christianity. And you got told no, you got your hand slapped and it happened in writing to and now you guys are still at it. Come on. Now you guys are coming up here to Galatia and you're trying to tell these Christians, these Gentile Christians up here and these churches that I just got done planting these fledgling Gentile Christians who we should be helping. Now you guys are coming up here and you're like, well, actually, we talked a little bit more with some of the most important Christians down in Jerusalem because that's where we're from Jerusalem. It's very important. You might have heard of it and they were like, yeah, it turns out the circumcision thing actually is a problem and we just needed to kind of walk that back a little bit. We do have a problem with a lot of you Greek types pretending like you're Christians. If you're not circumcised, you're going to have to really get circumcised and they bought it in Galatia. And that's part of why Paul is so mad. And here in Galatians two, Paul is like, no, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute. Does this pass the Ford Fiesta and whether or not you will ride in it in your junior year of college now that there are nicer vehicles to choose from test? No, it does not. Titus was there the whole time. Some of them raised objections. Those are the guys who got their hands slapped and are throwing you into confusion, Galatia and the other people who met with Titus, the pillars of the faith, they didn't say a dang thing. They didn't raise any objections. There was no problem. So there is no problem. And now I've done it. I've gone off. I've burned all of our time cracking jokes about fake Greek names and talking about circumcision. And now I didn't read you the part of this actually from the Bible. We did Bible today. We did Acts 15. So that's pretty good. But I got to actually read you Galatians two and break down what Paul actually said and how he actually employs Titus as a test case here. I should have done this the other way. I probably should have done this the other way. Whatever. We are what we are. And here we are. So we're just going to pick it up right where we left off tomorrow. We're going to look at Galatians two. We're going to see how Paul articulates all of this. I bet it's going to be a lot more efficient and have fewer juvenile infantile jokes than I had. And we will just go from there. All right. I'm going to hit pause. We're coming back tomorrow. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
