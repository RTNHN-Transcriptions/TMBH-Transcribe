For us, that's a two part lawmaking body. It's a Senate, the House of Representatives, the smaller one. House of Representatives, the big one. It's like almost 500 people. So they get together. They got all these little rules that are parliamentary for how they get things done. And some of those rules allow for a bit of shenanigans. And from time to time, you'll hear about some midnight assembly to try and sneak something through that happened recently, where one party had an idea for something they wanted to get done and they found some procedural loophole to get it done. And a member of the other party heard about it like three in the morning and showed up and was like, hey, no, you can't do that. We're going to have to do it in front of everybody. And then everybody's irritated and annoyed because it's politics and that's just how it works. There's a bunch of people jockeying for power and trying to justify it in themselves that they're doing something terribly moral and selfless to serve everyone else when in reality. And it's all just kind of ick. Well, it's easy for us to be like, man, politicians are just the worst. I mean, who isn't going to stand up and applaud and agree with me on that? Like what politicians and their moms would be the only people who are really excited about politicians. The rest of us, it's like shooting fish in a barrel to say, there's something wrong with that ilk. But if I'm going to be completely honest, I do a little bit of politicking myself and I did a ton of politicking when I was a kid. Like I try to find a quick opportunity to pull my parents aside and workshop an idea or get something for myself when the other two siblings weren't there to muddy the waters with their requests. So I mean, yeah, it's human nature. We all like to try to work angles. It's embarrassing when we get caught. Hopefully as we grow up a little bit and become a bit more dignified, we maybe knock it off with that stuff and manage to become a little bit more selfless. But it's hard empathy and grace and peace to all of us for being a little bit selfish and a little bit jerk sometimes. I just, I get it. And with that in mind, it's hard for me to get super judgy and mad at James and John and their mom here in Matthew chapter 20 for trying to pull off one of these clever little parliamentary assides with Jesus when nobody's looking. The other disciples are not around. Jesus just got done saying that he's going to die and he raised back to life. And that means that this is like the kingdom thing would happen and kings have people who said that they're right and left hand. So James and John's mom runs up and she's like, Hey, Jesus, real quick. Just one of them is here. I mean, I just had a favor. I wanted to ask of you, can my kids like rule for all of eternity with you sitting here right and left hand? Like, no, we don't need to speak about it loudly. Let's just cover that now. Maybe we can just make a commitment come to a decision somehow that would be completely binding. We just do that real quick. And Jesus is like, yeah, you guys can't really drink from the cup I'm going to drink from. Yeah, we can. And Jesus is like, I mean, in a way, yeah, I guess you're going to drink from it, but not exactly in the same way. And it's not up to me to give away the right and the left. Like that's all my father's stuff anyway. And then, well, as is so often the case when somebody tries to pull a little parliamentary stunt, sneaking through some binding legislation when nobody's looking when the rest of everybody involved in the decision making finds out that that shenanigans gets pulled. They're really mad. And so we have a bit of a unity crisis amongst the disciples of Jesus that starts here in Matthew 2024 at a moment that should be filled with grief and wonder and confusion and excitement and questions because Jesus just said he's going to die and die violently at the hands of the Romans and he's going to be raised back to life. But instead, once again, parliamentary bickering is what we get. Verse 24, when the 10 heard about this, that being James and John, their moms request that those two should get to sit at the right hand of Jesus forever, they were indignant with the two brothers. Well, fair enough, they're pulling a stunt here. It's reasonable to be irritated with them. We got a brewing crisis. They're about to start bickering and ripping each other apart. And these are the people who Jesus has invested in the most. They're the plan for taking forward the whole message of the kingdom and the church and everything. He can't be fighting about this stupid stuff. It's never going to work. Jesus knows he's about to die. Seriously, this is the parting gift you all are going to give me. The thing that I want most is to have a clear sense that you understand what this thing is and that you're ready. I'm saying that from a very human perspective, but I think you're tracking with me. And so he calls him together and he says, you know that the rulers of the Gentiles lorded over them and their high officials exercise authority over them? Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be your slave. So this is son of man didn't come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. And if you're sitting there listening to Jesus words and you're like, didn't he just say something like that? The answer is yes, you are right and you are paying attention. Good job. At the end of chapter 19, Peter's like, well, what do I get? So Peter kind of pulled one of these little parliamentary aside. I mean, maybe it's not a side. He'd probably ask that question in front of everybody. Like, hey, we've left everything and now you're muddying the water with all of this stuff that you're saying to this rich young ruler, you're saying that like, if you have possessions or stuff, it's like a camel getting through the eye of a needle. And how does this work? How can anybody be saved? And then Jesus is like, well, God, it's possible with man. It's not possible. And Peter's like, well, I just don't get it. How's it work? You're going to be gone. What's our fallback plan? What do we get? We left our jobs and our families and stuff. Like, how is this going to work? And then Jesus affirms them and says, no, look, like you've got a role here. And it's a very significant one. You just hang in. This is going to be good. And not just you, but everyone who gives stuff up to pick up their cross and follow me, I'm kind of mingling a couple of passages together there. There's going to be a reward. And he goes right to hyperbole here. It's not literally 100 times. It's like 100 times as much. That's going to be your reward. You're going to get eternal life. But many who are first, they're going to be last. And many who are last will be first. And you think, like, OK, I get it. Just pride is not going to work here. We're not owed anything by God. It's all about his character and what he does. I get it. But they don't get it. And I don't totally get it. So then Jesus gives us that whole parable about the landowner and the day laborers who he brings in at different times of the day. And then he pays them all the same thing. And he gets to the end and repeats that same thing. So the last will be first and the first will be last. You would think that would do it. He said the thing. Peter asked the question. He's just reassured them like, no, it's going to be good because of my character. But the first will be last. The last will be first. And here's a whole parable. And the first will be last. The last will be first. You'd think that would do it. And then he's like, OK, so in light of that, here's kind of what that looks like. I'm the first because I'm the king. I'm the awesomest. He doesn't say all that. But I mean, it should be pretty evident from the stuff that he's done. And I'm going to go die. Not a cheap one or a quick one either. Not like a quick swing of the sword or something. I'm going to get flogged. I'm going to turn the hamburger back and then I'm going to get crucified. I'm going to suffer horribly. And then I'm going to come back to life. So that's kind of what this first last, last, first thing might look like. Here's an example of that. And immediately the disciples start scheming like, oh, yeah, first will be last. That's deep. So at any rate, can I please be first? What? No. And then the other disciples are mad because they're like, I thought we were going to maybe not do that, but if we were allowed to, then I would guess I would want to ask to be first. And so Jesus pulls them together and he repeats the same thing again. For like the fourth time overtly or subtly political world system, Kings, Lord, their authority and their position over everybody else. That's how the world system works. You accomplish even the slightest thing. You gain even the slightest bit of authority. It goes right to your head. It makes you feel important and significant pretty quickly. You can't even imagine who you are without that achievement to those accolades, that authority, those resources. And you lord it over other people, even if you do it in a socially clever, mature, subtle way, so that you still look dignified. You're still doing it because that's how people are. That's how the world system works, not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great amongst you must first be your servant. There it is again. And now just in case that wasn't clear enough, here it is again, again, verse 27. And whoever wants to be first must be your slave. Why does Jesus have to say this so much? One, because it's very, very, very, very difficult and runs contrary to every bit of our nature in every way. Two, because the people he's saying it to who he really needs to internalize it are clearly not internalizing it. And they're getting ready to tear each other apart in a mad grab for power. Now Jesus is going to round out this thought that has been beautifully structured over the last 30 plus verses of this passage that spans chapter 19 and on into chapter 20. He's going to round all of that out by once again demonstrating, spelling it out even more clearly that he's the first. He's the best. He can break the laws of time and space. He existed before time began. He's the infinite, the Alpha, the Omega. He's the king of everything. He's God in the flesh. If you've seen him, you've seen the father, he's that. But in spite of all of that, he didn't show up here to be served. He came to serve. What? And not just to serve, but to die. What? And not just for no reason, but to die for the very people he is serving, the very people who don't get this and are not worthy of it. He's better, the people he came to serve and he came to die for are worse and he's doing it anyway. In other words, disciples, I'm not asking you to do anything that I'm not willing to do in several order of magnitudes. More significance. First, Jesus is leading from the front. Jesus is leading by example. Jesus is the embodiment of this right mentality. And later on the Apostle Paul, who was a very fancy man himself with a whole lot of accolades and a whole lot of things to lord over other people, he eventually comes around understanding this principle as well. And when he writes to the church in Philippi, he points right back to what Jesus is talking about in terms of his attitude here in Matthew chapter 20 with this very famous passage, Philippians 2 starting in verse 5. Paul writes, your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus, who being in very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be grasped. He made himself nothing, taken on the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross. Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Right there sums up everything we've been looking at in Matthew chapter 19 and 20 about this first and last stuff and about how Jesus modeled it for everybody more profoundly than we could ever have asked for and in a way that should set the example, even though it's fair to admit that this is a difficult example to follow and can't be followed apart from the work of God.
