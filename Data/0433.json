I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and the funny thing about sayings is that if you mess with them even a little bit, they suddenly mean something very different. For example, I just made this one up. I hope it's going to work. I haven't really tried this out yet. Fish and company stink after three days. You've heard that one. It's pretty easy to know what it means, right? Oh, you let fish sit out for too long and they get kind of gross. So ha ha ha, company can be like fish. And if they're around too long, they go from being pleasant to very unpleasant and you're eager for them to be out of your house because of what the rotting fish or the stayed too long company is doing to the vibe in your home. But what if we just slightly alter that saying and what we discover is that, oh no, fish and companies stink after three days is actually an old English saying and the word for fish is actually very close to the word for fist. And somebody just misunderstood it. The real saying is fists and company stink after three days. Why would people have said that? What does it mean? It gets like fighting with people, gets old after three days because this use those for fighting and fight for too long. It wears you down and you want the fight to be over. If you fight with your company too long, that doesn't feel very good. Fists and company, fishing company. Okay, whatever. But we have to admit that we get to whatever the meaning is slightly different. It changes the meaning to mess with that one word. Likewise, when we look at Matthew chapter 19 and verse 24 with this very, very famous saying of Jesus, probably a top 10 famous saying of Jesus, even for people who've never read the Bible and aren't familiar with what part of the Bible it comes from. When we look at this phrase that Jesus says about a camel going through the eye of a needle, there is some contention throughout the centuries as to whether we're even actually getting this phrase right and whether this rendering that you and I have heard and repeated so many times is actually even reflective of what Jesus said. So once again, there's a rich young ruler. He comes to Jesus. It's a nice exchange. It seems like Jesus even kind of likes the guy. He's got a soft spot for him, but the kid comes up and the passage portrays him as waving his world kingdom resume about and trying to use the currency of his money and his name and his wealth and his reputation to impress Jesus and to demonstrate that through his good behavior and all these other things that he has, that somehow he is worthy to come into the kingdom. But Jesus reiterates a point that's been iterated a whole bunch throughout Matthew. That being all of your impressive world kingdom accomplishments and stuff are infinitely reproducible by God. He doesn't actually need those things and you can't impress God into being a part of the kingdom. Rather, you assume this posture of humility, of total dependence on the king. And that, and only that is how you are admitted to the kingdom. It's by the grace and the character of the king, not by the impressive resume of the individual who aspires to be part of the kingdom. So we get done with that. And then the kid walks away because he's like, well, I want to be perfect. Tell me what I do to really nail this thing. And Jesus is like, okay, if you want to be perfect, do this. And it was something he wasn't willing to do. And it was a conundrum for the rich young ruler. He's like, well, if I give up all of my stuff, as Jesus told him to do and I sell it, then that takes away the thing that makes me me. And the thing that makes me me is what makes me so worthy of being in the kingdom. And I think he walks away sad and not wanting to part ways with his stuff, but also probably a little bit confused because of how foreign this equation is. That gets us into this brief exchange with the disciples that we're looking at again today. Jesus says to them, I tell you the truth. It's hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again, I tell you, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. I think you and I had a productive conversation about this yesterday. And I think the meaning of the text really isn't that tough given what we're reading here. But what if much like the fist fish thing, we are misunderstanding the word camel, what if, as I have heard in some sermons and in a few commentaries here and there, the better translation would be thick, heavy rope. So that would have Jesus saying, again, I tell you, it's easier for a thick, heavy rope to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Now, before we go just dismissing this, I have to acknowledge there is some historical precedent for this. There's a church father named Cyril of Alexandria, a very important, very famous church father who somewhere in the fifth century suggested that not shouldn't be translated camel. It should be translated rope. There must be some mistake in the manuscripts. And part of what he pointed to here is the fact that the word for camel in Greek is almost identical to the word for thick, heavy rope in Aramaic. But the word for camel in Aramaic is not as close to the word for rope in Aramaic. So what, what's going on here? Now, we even got a couple of manuscripts granted they date to a thousand years after the time of Christ and the New Testament. But we've even got a couple of manuscripts in the nine hundreds in the one thousands that use the Greek word for rope instead of the Greek word for camel. There's overwhelming agreement between all the manuscripts we have of Matthew, Mark and Luke, the three books of the Bible where this exchange comes up. There's overwhelming agreement among the manuscripts that what we're looking at here is the word camel in Greek. But I mean, we're trying to be fair to the evidence here. There's a couple renderings that have this heavy rope translation. Now, the Greek word that pretty much every manuscript of Matthew has here in Matthew 1924 is comellon or comellos depending on the form. And it's not that tricky to see the same word gets used everywhere camel comes up. And this exact same word, comellon is used when Matthew and Mark give the description of the outfit that John the Baptist wore a garment made of camel's hair. It doesn't work quite as well to say a garment of thick heavy rope. But I suppose it's not completely impossible to make a case for that. The same exact word, comellon gets used over in Matthew 23 24 where Jesus is rebuking some people and he says you blind guides you strain out a net, but swallow a camel would make a ton of sense there for him to be saying you strain out a net, but swallow a thick heavy rope. Now, the strongest evidence suggests that now the word that we've got in all of our Greek texts from which modern translations are translated is comellos, comellon and not the much more rarely used comellon, comellon, comellon. That's the difference between the two. And that latter word would describe a thick heavy rope or a cable. What's interesting though is that when I hear people talk about this argument from Matthew 19 24, they talk as though it profoundly changes the metaphor. No, let's think about that for a second. It's in the tell you the truth. It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for rich man and or the king of heaven. Okay. Well, camel's like the biggest animal you can think of. The biggest thing that would be out meandering around eye of a needle is the narrowest opening that any normal person would think of. So, okay, it seems to work. It just makes it clear that's not very likely to happen. But then you think about a thick heavy rope. I guess, yeah, threads or strings or what you would normally put through the eye of a needle. So, okay. I'm not sure there's much distinction between the possibility of this being a big giant heavy rope would have trouble passing through an eye of a needle versus a camel would have trouble passing through an eye. Neither of them are going through the eye of the needle. So the question then comes down to two things. One, what we've already done, which is looking at the actual words and thinking through what's going on. And I have to concede the reality that it looks like the Aramaic word for thick heavy rope could look very, very similar to the Greek word for camel. Okay. So we got that. And then the other way to consider the reality here is literary context. And well, which word seems more likely to have been used given what Jesus is saying. Does it make his point more strongly to say like a big ridiculous animal that's never going to fit through that eye of the needle? Ah, that would do it. Or does it make his point more strongly to be like a slightly bigger rope that probably wouldn't fit through there? I would argue it's more consistent with Jesus teaching style to use hyperbole as we talked about yesterday. That seems to have been a rhetorical style that Jesus likes to employ. And I don't think he more effectively illustrates his point by reducing the absurdity of this hyperbole. I camel through an eye of a needle down to like a much bigger rope through an eye of a needle. And I suppose in summary, other than as a curiosity to spend 10 minutes on a podcast on once in our lives, I don't really even see the upside to trying to make the case that no, it is this super minority position. And he did mean a thick heavy rope. How does that change the meaning enough that in some way it reframes it in a way that's like, oh, no, that's a very important biblical truth that was lost on us that we're trying to reclaim and salvage from the ashes of history so we can reconnect with the true thing Jesus meant to say. No, it seemed that the two possibilities we have in front of us here is that a it's completely ridiculously impossible to imagine that your world kingdom currency would have any value in buying you into the kingdom kingdom. Or if we take option number two with this thick heavy rope language, then I guess what Jesus is saying is it's only pretty silly to imagine that your world kingdom resources would have value or buy you into the kingdom kingdom somehow. So again, I know there are much smarter people than me out there who see this one differently, but after taking my best run at it here today, getting ready for this podcast, I got to say that I think the vast majority manuscript tradition, that being that the word here is indeed camel is probably the better read linguistically and contextually and either way, I guess I don't need to be in a fight with anybody because it seems like the meaning holds. But we're still out there with this camel. I have the needle thing because there's one more really interesting historical interpretive core here where some have suggested that there might have been a super secret gate that nobody knew about until relatively recently called the eye of the needle gate that camels could like squeeze through if they tried super hard, but it was very, very difficult and that that's what Jesus was referencing. We'll break down the veracity of that possibility next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
