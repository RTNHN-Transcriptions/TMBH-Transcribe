And right now, we're going through Esther. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Wait, this is a Monday episode. Camilla just said that. Good job, Camilla. Thank you. Isn't it really lovely? I'm going to talk about episodes of the podcast where we're going to talk about edicts that include killing and destroying and annihilating your enemies and even the women and children. She makes that feel a little less traumatic. I am grateful to her. I think she brightens this whole thing up quite a bit. Hey, I'm picking up right where we left off in our last conversation from last time around about this edict and the terribly, unavoidably violent implications of what has been said in motion with Haman's edict first and Mordecai and Esther's edict in response and Esther chapter 8. We see that this situation, I mean, it means business. This is going to be ugly. And it's interesting the way it actually all plays out that we don't really get a look at how it was ugly. And maybe that's why we don't immediately appreciate the horror of violence in the ancient world because here in the Book of Esther, we don't really have it spelled out for the fact that for us what the actual fight looks like when we finally get to that point. When you go and look at Herodotus, he doesn't give us a bunch of details about the military tactics and how it all worked back in this time. You just get the impression from the weapons and the warfare and the numbers that get thrown out that it really was a gruesome time in the history of the world. You're seeing the beginning flashes of civilization and even some sort of Pax Perziana here where the idea is to establish peace empire wide. But right beneath that golden veneer, that artistic veneer of civilization and artistry and sophistication is still this whole slew of ancient rivalries and tribal blood feuds. And we're just looking at one of them here in the Book of Esther when we look at the conflict between the Aggagites or the Amalekites of whom Haman is one and the Jewish people from whom Mordecai and Esther hail. These things existed all over the empire. This is just the big one, the story that makes its way down to us. I'm sure it was exemplary of a whole bunch of other tensions that existed as well. So we got this edict that goes out from Mordecai and Esther. It effectively reverses all of the circumstances of the edict of Xerxes from before. But it looks like Mordecai and Esther are treating this as an opportunity to settle a score that should have been settled a long time ago and that cannot just be kicked down the road forever. It's going to have to be settled. There's a certain people group within the ancient world who wants the Jews gone, eradicated. They will not be happy until they are all gone. Ten of the twelve tribes are already gone. That probably feels like a win to a whole bunch of people in this crowd. The fact that two of those twelve tribes from the kingdom of Judah, which was conquered in 586 by the predecessor to the Persians, that being the Babylonians and Nebuchadnezzar. The fact that two of those twelve tribes persist is a fly in their ointment. It is their turd in the punch bowl and they are not going to be happy until all the Jews are gone. So you got to appreciate that in the background of reading this text. You also got to appreciate when this is happening. Look, the deal is Esther and Mordecai seem to realize that the enemies of the Jews are about to reveal themselves. Almost providentially, God even through the evil intent of Haman has ordained through stuff that maybe looks like circumstance or even fate with the casting of the poor has ordained that on this day the enemies of the Jews are going to reveal themselves. And now, things have pivoted in such a way that the Jews are not to stand there and helplessly take it, but they are to go and fight back. And it kind of looks like the instruction is that that defense is to flip to offense. What about the language here that says that they are to destroy, kill and annihilate any armed force of any nationality or province that might attack them and their women and children and to plunder the property of their enemies? Now as it actually turns out, they don't end up plundering the property of their enemies, as I recall, but the edict goes on to say the day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the 13th day of the 12th month, the month of a Dar and then the copy of the letter gets sent out. Told you last time around, there are some people who try to put lipstick on this edict a little bit and reimagine it in terms of modern moral sensibilities and how we think about warfare. I disagree with them. I think the edict is exactly what it looks like the edict is. And part of the reason for that is the ongoing saga of the Amalekites who are the historical epitome of the people who want to destroy the Jews. There's specific language from God delivered through Moses saying, make a mental note of what happened here. Write this down on a scroll is something that shall be remembered and make sure that Joshua, that's going to be Moses' successor, hears it as well because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. So then Moses built an altar and called it the Lord is my banner and he said, for hands were lifted up to the throne of God, to the throne of the Lord, the Lord will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation. This isn't a little thing. This is a loose hanging a free flying thread from the history of the Bible that is not yet resolved. That stuff that I just read you is from Exodus. But then again, in Deuteronomy 25, it's re-emphasized. Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt, when you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey to cut off all who were lagging behind. They had no fear of God. When the Lord your God gives you rest from the enemies around you in the land, he's giving you to possess as an inheritance. You shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget. Look, it says what it says. It was an ancient blood feud that the Jews did not start with this cousin people group. Rather, when the time came and the opportunity was there, they revealed who they were. And that is people who want to see them dead, gone, and entirely eliminated from existence. And as you and I have discussed repeatedly, years and years later, the prophet Samuel, this would be 400-ish years after the stuff I was just reading you from Exodus and Deuteronomy. The prophet Samuel reminds Saul of exactly what those decrees were. I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. Now go attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Don't spare them. Look to death, men, women, and children, and infants cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys. That's 1 Samuel 15. Saul then doesn't do that. He defeats them, but strategically, he wants to keep them around probably apart from the command of God. If I were a king, that's the decision I would make as well just because of, I think, totally understandable moral squeamishness. But here, the difference is the story holds it out as there being an obvious God manifesting obvious power and triumphing over the pitiful efforts of false gods and false religions who have no power and are not present. And this God who appointed Saul said, this is what needs to happen. This has to be settled implicitly. If you look at the bigger text, the message is there are people who want to eliminate every single Hebrew person, every single Jewish person, but the redemptive plan runs through the Jews. So every time somebody tries to mess throughout the Old Testament with the Jewish people or end the line of Judah or the descendants of Abraham, something big happens. And sometimes it's obviously an overtly miraculously God, like the crossing of the Red Sea, for example, kind of hard to argue with that one. If you were there and you actually saw that happen, I think you'd attribute that to a supernatural force pretty clearly. That's what it must be, the timing, the event, the physics of it all speak for themselves. I mean, that was clearly God. But other times it's a lot more obscure. I mean, the Esther story, the one we're looking at, there's no smoking gun here. God isn't even mentioned. So sometimes it's overt. Other times it's subtle. But along the way, anytime anything messes with God's chosen people and the preservation of this lineage through which redemption for all of humankind is going to come, it looks like God just simply isn't allowing that to happen. And the idea of there being this age, old blood rival who are dedicated to the elimination of God's chosen people and thus effectively the most opposed people to God's redemptive plan, that's where we get a lot of these understandably to modernize troubling passages that we encounter about stuff like this. The Bible is very much holding it out as though the Amalekites are a legitimate threat to completely eliminate the Jewish people. And when we look at the tone and the assumptions behind the text of this ancient document, there is no apologizing for it. Are you catching that? There's nothing here in Esther chapter eight that would cause the reader to be like, oh, no. And that was a very sad day for the Jews and for Xerxes and for everyone alike because these were such dark tidings. No, in ancient thought, this is a total reversal and it's a flip from a complete defeat to a complete victory. And tonally, the way I'm going to read this text out loud to you is different than the tone that somebody even today who is Jewish would take in reading this text. And it would be entirely different than the tone of how somebody would read this in the ancient world. And you're going to see that as we get to the end of chapter eight because the last three or four verses are all celebratory and jubilant and everyone is thrilled. It's like the ticker tape parade after we won World War II in Times Square. Everybody's unified and cheering and Hitler got what was coming to him. Go not Hitler. Go not Nazis. We won. It's great. That is the tone that we're intended to feel as we read Esther chapter eight. And so we just have to take that for what it is. The original audience was not flinching here and thinking, Oh, well, you know, both sides. This is kind of tricky. They should have looked for a ceasefire or considered what a proportionate response to the pursuit of their eradication would have looked like. No, instead everybody's like, Hey, we're going to win. We're going to win. We're not going to be eradicated. We're not going to get genocide. We're going to defeat our enemies. And in this moment of opportunity, we're going to defeat our enemies who will never rest until we're gone once and for all forever. And the mood is celebratory. And look, I'm not going to tell you what to do with that because I can say that, but the reality is I was born when I was born. And I do have the moral sensibilities that I have. And as much as I've been around the Bible, I do struggle in certain points to jump back in there and really immerse myself in the feel of the moment and the mentality of the original audience. And that's okay. The Bible can handle that. It's done just fine through the centuries as people have thought about things in different ways. I don't think God or the text is threatened by me looking at this through modern eyes and really having to wrestle with it to make sense of how I'm supposed to feel or what's going on. But the text itself is not ambiguous at all. This is a huge win. This is even though he's unnamed clearly by the providence of God. The tables have turned. Let there be celebration, even though the day of reckoning hasn't happened yet. The outcome is a foregone conclusion. Even a Haman's wife at the end of chapter six could see that the outcome was now a foregone conclusion. I'm just going to let you stew on that and wrestle with it while I do the exact same thing. And then we're going to look at the jubilation that occurs at the end of the chapter. And we're going to see a really interesting response from a certain group of people who originally were thinking they'd probably be a part of eradicating all the Jews, but decide to play it a little different way instead. Thanks for letting me just game this out and grapple with it with you in real time here these last couple of days. I appreciate you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
