This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. In a few years back, I was playing a computer game with one of my friends, a guy named Jeremy, dear friend, all the way back to high school, like that kind of dear friend. And it's a game that is one of these strategy, medieval, magic kind of turn-based games. And what we did is we went into the map editor. You can design how you want the game to be in there. You can put treasures and artifacts that make your heroes more powerful and allow you to build bigger empires to fight against each other. And so we did like a draft. It was really fun. He had his computer open and I had mine open. I was like, okay, we can pick two elite-level artifacts and make it so that they're just going to be sitting right there by our hero when we start. And that way we get this little boost in the beginning. We'll get into the heart of the game quicker. And so we negotiated and debated who could get what. And then we played this massive, massive multi-day campaign together. And it was fun. His character turned out to be stronger and he outperformed me by a lot. But we had a nice time when we get along. Fast forward, I don't know, six months, maybe a year. And I'm like, you know what? That map that he and I made together was pretty fun. I'm just going to cue that back up and I'll play as his character because it seemed like things worked out well and we'll get it from his perspective. And so I load the thing up and I'm walking around at the very beginning of the game. I'm like, hey, what's this little cave right here? I don't remember that. And so I went into the cave and lo and behold, it's a treasure trove. He went back in and made a cave of wonders that was filled to the brim with golden stuff like in a Latin, except unlike a Latin, he was able to harvest it all and use it to get way ahead. And I was like, hey, I was just perusing around that long campaign game that we made the other day and I couldn't help but notice your cave of wonders. And he's like, well, and then he just laughed and owned it and I laughed back. But I continue to give him a hard time about that years after the fact and I think I might until we're dead someday. The point is this, somebody went back in after everything was made and changed the ground rules for their own purposes and to benefit themselves. And it wasn't me. Likewise, when you talk about certain passages in the Bible, there is a historical controversy and the suggestion that maybe somebody went back in after the fact and added a little cave of wonders to benefit whatever group they're a part of to make the Bible maybe more explicit on a given point. The accusation is that maybe some later scribes tried to help the text to make it more clear and add a smoking gun verse or statement here or there that would more demonstrate what was already pretty mainstream Christian theology to make it even more mainstream. Some others have argued that people maybe went in after the fact and created a textual cave of wonders with this verse or that verse in the Bible to defeat a heretical group or another brand of Christianity or to advance the cause of one political faction or another in the early years of Christianity. Now eventually there is such uniformity in the Bible and it's so well circulated that you really couldn't get away with this anymore. Well setting aside for the moment whether or not there's any credibility to those accusations, Matthew 1127 is one of those verses that at times has been accused of being an after the fact cave of wonders to help the cause of what we now call orthodoxy. And it makes sense that that accusation might come in because this is a gigantic verse. It's the I am Iron Man moment. I am the son of God moment from Jesus and he says here all things have been committed to me. This is Jesus talking by my father. No one knows of the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and those whom the son chooses to reveal him. This is gigantic. He's just coming out and being like you know what? I am the son of God and he's owning it and further he's saying and I know God and God knows me and he's my father and we have this intimate unique relationship and nobody can even really get a glimpse of that relationship unless the son chooses to reveal to that individual what this relationship between the father and the son is and the union between the father and the son and this is one of the foundational verses for understanding the Trinity. And so for you and me and the original audience and the original readers of Matthew, look this is a really high stakes verse. Either Jesus is saying yep all of that stuff that is maybe hinted to or pointed at me being the son of God and therefore surely the Christ the Messiah. Yep, that's true and nope not everybody is going to be in as a lot of implications for you and me and everybody else and if that verse isn't a real verse we should read the next several chapters of Matthew very differently. It changes the whole thematic narrative arc of what we're getting here but if that verse is supposed to be there well then we are into a whole new act a whole new phase and context of how we understand Jesus and how we contextualize the stuff that he says and does moving forward. So the stakes are very high for the honest onlooker who's trying to read the Bible on its own terms and give it a fair shake. The criticism goes like this we've got these three gospels Matthew Mark Luke that all have a pretty similar look and a pretty similar structure there called the sin optic gospel sin same optic eye there from a similar point of view. Then you got John which is weird and goofy and there's much more debate about when exactly John was written when it happened how it relates to what John also wrote that is revelation in first second and third John but John almost seems to be answering a different set of theological questions and it's almost as though certain sects of Christian faith had started to emerge by the time he wrote John and some people and I'm one of them would suggest that John looks like he's pushing back on some ideas that he rejects specifically Gnosticism in first John it's very explicit there and while history has given us a ton of different strains of Gnosticism which is a hybrid of certain Greek philosophical assumptions dualism and sort of historical Christianity we got a whole bunch of different versions of Gnosticism but they all have this thing in common the relationship between the physical son of God Jesus and the spiritual heavenly father that is tricky and sometimes the Gnostics would be like well I mean the father is problematic because he made material things and the physical world is bad and the spiritual world is good but Jesus points people toward the spiritual world and so that's better and again Gnosticism is always evolving it's very diverse and complex and I'm really flattening it out for the sake of time but John it looks like is really hammering this relationship between the father and the son to demonstrate they are on the same page John 1 34 as John the Baptist talking I've seen and I testify that this is the son of God I mean he's talking about Jesus right there verse 49 of the same chapter then Nathaniel declared Rabbi you are the son of God you are the king of Israel then John 3 the most famous passage maybe in the whole Bible for God so love the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him and should have eternal life and not perish but God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him it reads a little different when you put the emphasis on son doesn't it whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only son John the Baptist again later in chapter 3 whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for God's wrath remains in him there is a ton more in John and I mean I could just keep doing this for a very long time but I think you get the gist so John pretty much inarguably and historically everybody says yeah I mean he's drilling the son of God thing whether or not you believe Jesus is the son of God is of course a completely different conversation but I think most people who look closely at this stuff would say John legitimately has so many references to this it's such a point of emphasis he's got these seven statements where Jesus says I am indicating that John really wants us to know that Jesus is God in the flesh and that Jesus is the son of God but then some people come along a little bit later in the game relatively recently in the grand history of Christianity and they look at Matthew 1127 and they're like I don't know that sounds a lot like John and so they theorize that after the gospels had begun to circulate and maybe the late first century early second century some might argue maybe some people in the early church felt like they needed to help the first three gospels and how they characterized the sonship of Jesus and so maybe we borrowed some Johanine language that's fancy word for stuff from John or in John style and we crammed it right here into Matthew 11 now look you know I think the Bible is pretty dang well put together book and that I think it's a very credible book one of the ways you might be able to figure that out is because of how I put time into it every single day and we talk about it and I probably wouldn't waste my time on this if I looked closely at it and thought the whole thing were a giant dump but it is possible that I want it to be true you have to factor that in when you listen to me I'm trying to be fair but maybe I just so badly want there to be a God behind it that I might not read all of this data fairly so you got to take that into account and in support of the possibility that I'm wrong we got to go over and look at acts chapter eight check that no we are not going to go to acts chapter eight right now and the reason for that is because I just looked at the time wow how are we already this far in that's an interesting topic that I got a deep dive into I'm not going to quit here's what I'm going to do I am just going to keep recording right now I'm going to split this into two episodes and we're just going to do a bonus episode this week I'm going to release them both at once so that you can catch them both but I don't want to ruin my average time I like to keep it around ten minutes of actual content allowing a minute or two for goofing around on the front end in the back end so I'm going to hit pause right here if you are listening to this episode right now it means you also have access to the follow up I'm going to publish both of these immediately we'll jump over to acts chapter eight and just pick up right where we left off a mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast see you in a second.",
