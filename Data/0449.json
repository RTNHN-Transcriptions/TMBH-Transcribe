This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and yes, then it's a stretch. We are picking up where we left off yesterday. We're in Matthew chapter 20 looking at this little passage. It says, now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the 12 disciples aside and he said to him, we're going up to Jerusalem and the son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They'll condemn him to death and we'll turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. And on the third day, he'll be raised to life. This is pretty weighty stuff. And for you and I with the benefit of looking backwards on a text like this, it feels like, Oh, yeah, well, obviously that's the deal. But this was brand new news to the disciples and this brand new for the person who's reading straight through the book of Matthew for the first time. So there's a lot to unpack here. So I'm going to let Jeff play some music and then we're going to go do that. Death is a profoundly human experience. And Jesus is gradually spelling out more specifically that the son of man emphasizing the humanity of Christ is going to suffer the fate of humans. But it's not going to play out exactly the way it does as humans because there's this weird twist to every illusion that Jesus is making himself or that Matthew describes narratively to this whole death thing. And that is resurrection. He's going to be raised to life. Jesus is saying this again and again in every one of these mentions that this is going to happen, but he's going to be quote raised from the dead that he's going to be quote. They will kill him. And on the third day, he will be raised to life that he's going to be quote from Matthew on the third day be raised to life. And again here in chapter 20, quote on the third day, he will be raised to life. That is for explicit references to being raised back to life and what the timeline is going to look like in that regard. In other words, his death is not going to go down like most people's deaths. And it's going to accomplish something. Maybe people are still a little bit confused at this point as to what exactly it's going to accomplish. But no longer is Jesus talking about death in vague terms or in loosely spiritual terms that people could kind of understand what kind of death does he mean? Is he going to spiritually die and then be spiritually raised? How's this going to work? And in the same way that as a kid, I was a little out of touch with what exactly was meant by death. What are the details? How does that go down? How does it feel? What does it look like? But gradually I became more acquainted with what that looks like in the specifics. So gradually, the disciples are going from this vague notion of the impending death of their king, their teacher, their rabbi, their friend, to a very specific notion of what that death is going to look like. And that's also part of the power of this little passage we're looking at right now. Jesus says, again, we're going up to Jerusalem and the son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They'll condemn him to death and they will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. So in just a couple of sentences, the disciples have gone from a vague understanding that somehow some kind of death is going to occur to a very specific understanding of exactly what this death is going to look like. It's going to be incredibly physical. It's going to be painful. It will involve torture. It will involve shame, crucifixion would have popped in their minds immediately as a dishonorable death for people who are determined by the state to be the scourge of society. Then why do you kill somebody with a cross? Are we so close to the math problem that it's difficult for us to think about that anymore? Are we so used to seeing people wearing that around their necks and seeing this as a point of decor that it becomes difficult for us to step back and think about what the motivation would be for a government that wants to do that? Let's try this exercise real quick. Why would they use crosses to kill people? Surely, some kind of stabbing would be much neater and much quicker. You wouldn't have to pay for so many man hours or so much equipment. If you tied somebody up and just held their head in a bucket, maybe drowned them. There are a lot of quicker ways to execute a person. Why go to all the trouble? The answer is one of the reasons that societies employ the death penalty is something that I'm against. If you like the death penalty, we can agree to disagree. I just think it's too easy to make a mistake on that. That's one of those mistakes. If you can't unmake it better to go with caution than with aggression on something like that that involves a life and the potential to make us all dirty, owning the stain of killing somebody who shouldn't have been killed. That can happen. One example I would offer of a time when somebody got killed, who shouldn't have been killed, at least from a legal sense would be. Jesus of Nazareth, who we're talking about right here, so we know it can happen. There's my little aside on why I'm against a death penalty. I got more reasons for it. Whatever. You land wherever you land, but let's still just be candid about why societies have gone with the death penalty. One, somebody is just so bad that you want to eliminate any risk of them doing bad things again in the future. Two, revenge. It's punitive. You did this bad thing. We're going to do this bad thing over here. It looks like the death penalty and physical punishment was part of the deal in the theocracy of the Old Testament, at least. Well, what was it? I for an eye, tooth for a tooth. If we read the Bible in its entire context, we also have to acknowledge that those harsh rules of the Old Testament were designed to be set up as a contrast to the mercy and the grace of God and what happens in the grace and forgiveness of Jesus. Everybody who does such things deserve death, but in Christ, this different fate is what awaits. All of that said, we still have to acknowledge that historically, one of the reasons states execute certain criminals is punitive. It feels like there. The scales are now evened out. Justice has been done. But another reason is that the state wants to make an example of what happens to people who do bad things. So you got thieves, murderers, robbers, whatever. What's Rome trying to accomplish right now? They're trying to keep order and sanity in these provinces. They're trying their hand at having the biggest empire the world has ever known. They're doing this by having local ethnic client kings work with their ethnically Roman governmental overlords because they think the local ethnic client kings are going to have a better shot at pacifying the crowds and making people work and integrating them as Romans. And so so much of Roman policy in the first century is just like we want to collect your taxes and we don't want to have to pay to put down rebellions. So that's that's our prime directive here in terms of what we want our governors and our client kings to accomplish. Well, if that's the case, then very public executions from time to time could be a useful tool of the state to say this person is exactly everything that we will not tolerate in this society. We're going to lift this person up really high so everybody can see them dying and dying slowly. This will be an event. It will unfold over time. And you're going to have time after work or whenever you're passing by to get a look at what the least desirable least acceptable type of person in this society is. And hey, if you want the exact same fate, you just go ahead and imitate them. But if you want to live a life of peace and calm, don't be like that deplorable awful person who we're punishing in this way as an example as a deterrent. So we jump back into Matthew 2019 and the disciples know Jesus is going to get killed. They probably were figuring that the Jewish leaders would do it, which is probably difficult for them to picture in their minds as Jewish leaders can't kill people. They no longer have the power of the sword. Rome has taken that from them. And so they're probably wondering like, how's this going to work? Are these going to get handed over? And this is going to go down? Who's actually going to swing the sword? Well, now we know crucified means immediately to the original audience. It's not going to be the Jews. It's going to be the Romans who do this, the Romans. What? This is your first time reading Matthew. Oh, I have 20 chapters into this thing. Romans. Who the heck are they? Did they even come up? Okay. Yeah, we got that one Roman centurion in chapter eight, who's a part of the occupying force. But he bent the need of Jesus and understood who he was. That's like it. There's nothing about Romans. We had stuff about somebody from the Herod family killing John the Baptist. I mean, that's an ethnic sort of a sub client king. We think of Rome against the backdrop of this story because we look back at it all in some 2000 years after the fact. But if you just picked up Matthew and you came from outer space and you're just starting to learn this story, at this point, you'd be like, whoa, how does Rome even factor in? Like I knew they were there. But this seems like a conversation that is happening entirely apart from Rome and from the mechanisms of the secular state. This is going to somehow overlap. I mean, maybe you flip forward, you're like, there's only like this many pages left. How are we going to integrate Rome into this thing and have them get so mad that they want to kill Jesus and just that many pages? I don't know. We'll see how this thing works out. But for the original audience, and we know from the text that the people who were right there were only the disciples. It says he took his disciples aside and spelled out like, Hey, guys, here is exactly what we're walking into. But he tells them this and sets their world spinning. What Rome is going to kill you? You're going to get flogged. You're going to get mocked and you're the good guy. You haven't done anything to anybody. We haven't hurt anybody. We haven't picked any fights with anybody. We're not stealing things. We're not committing crimes. We're certainly not revolutionaries or brigands. I mean, those are the kind of people who get crucified. What the heck is going to happen over the next few days that we're going to go from what this thing has been like a cool little miracle in teaching to her to crucified. It just wouldn't have computed for them at all. But in this moment, they go through the same thing that I went through. Death for those people who they love interfacing it goes from this vague notion of I can't even picture that. But if you tell me that person I love is going to die, I guess I'll try to understand and think about it. It goes from that to very specifically, no, this is what the suffering is going to look like. This is how it's going to go down and this is what it's going to mean. Obviously, this crucifixion thing is going to come up a little bit more as we're talking about all of this. So there's a bunch more to unpack from the Old Testament about the theology of the thing that we are going to get to. But for these couple of conversations we've just had, I think it's important to focus on this pivot point in terms of specificity and getting a sense of how this thing is actually going to play out a little bit more. And it's important to focus on that title, Son of Man and the humility that comes along with that as well as the grand eternal redemptive promises, harkening back to Daniel 7 that come along with that. There's a whole lot in this much more specific description that Jesus is giving here of what is death and resurrection are going to look like. And all of that is going to very specifically inform what happens next, which is kind of oddly a callback to what we've been dealing with in terms of this, who's going to be first, who's going to be last, how does that all work with the values of the kingdom business that we've talked about over the last couple of weeks.
