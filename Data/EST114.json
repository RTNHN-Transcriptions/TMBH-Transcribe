This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast, and we have been talking about ancient Persia in the fifth century BC as we work through one of the all time great stories for the whole history of ever, not just in the Bible, but of all of the world ever, the book of Esther. And we're getting to this place in the book of Esther where the whole story, which has gigantic stakes, is about to hinge on just a couple of lines of dialogue that at least for one of the two people involved in this conversation is just sort of casual, getting his morning coffee, thinking about some stuff. And for the other guy, it's gigantic. It's huge, very important, but they don't understand. So the situation that we're getting to here in Esther chapter six, it's like one of those comedies where the whole joke is based on the missed assumptions of the different characters and the communication isn't quite clear. And maybe so and so thinks that this dude really likes her, but actually he was talking about her best friend. And then everybody acts in ways in keeping with their assumptions and hilarity ensues. It's the kind of comedy where it could be fixed with just one crystal clear adult conversation where you ask probing questions and make sure everybody's on the same page, but then hilarity would not ensue and we wouldn't have a comedy and it wouldn't be fun. What we're getting to in Esther six is really a very comedic moment, maybe the funniest moment for the original audience, maybe the funniest moment for us to in the whole dang story. And it comes right on the heels of massive dramatic tension. And so it's kind of crazy that this then gets resolved in a way that is so chuckle worthy. Xerxes, the king, he's staying up late because you can't sleep here on the eve of the day that Mordecai, the Jew is to be run through and held up high for everybody to see by his rival, Heyman, the right hand man of the king. And so Xerxes is up and he's having one of the chroniclers read some chronicles to him. I can't imagine how many volumes there were, but it just happened to pick the right one that happened to cover the moment in Xerxes reign when Mordecai, the Jew uncovered a plot by two guys, big than a Tarrish out at the gates of the palace. They wanted to kill Xerxes and Mordecai was like, I'm not going to sit on that. I know somebody in the palace who could help out the king. He tells Esther, Esther tells the king gives credit to Mordecai. The king is saved and that's really the last we ever hear of that. The next thing we read about in the story is Heyman being elevated. Well, the king is like, dang, we never did anything for Mordecai that you really should have done that. And at that exact moment, here's footsteps out in the courtyard and it's super early and he's like, huh, who would be up at this hour? We're not really doing business yet. And he asks the question, who's in the courtyard and is attendance answered? Heyman is standing in the court. We'll bring him in. The king ordered. Now we're into verse six of Esther chapter six is where it starts to get funny. When Heyman entered the king asked him, well, what should be done for the man the king delights to honor? Now Heyman thought to himself, was it that the king would rather honor than me? So he answered the king and just look at how precise this answer is. He had clearly thought about what kind of honor he would like to receive and what he had fantasized about the king doing for him someday. So he just reels this thing off in precise detail for the man, the king delights to honor, have them bring a royal robe that the king is worn and a horse. The king is ridden one with a royal crest placed on its head, then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princes. Then let them robe the man, the king delights to honor and lead him on his horse through the city streets proclaiming before him. This is what is done for the man, the king delights to honor. Wow, that is so much stuff he had in mind for himself. I know people who win awards and are good at things. I have a friend who recently won a super impressive award and we had lengthy conversations about the discomfort with receiving that award. And that's a result of this friend's character. I know another lady who won a big award and she was really uncomfortable with it and was not quite sure how to even receive it or how to talk about it because for a humble person, it's weird to have something like that happen and it doesn't necessarily even feel right or good to be propped up in that kind of way. But for Heyman, man, while he's thinking about lifting up Mordecai in a violent way, he's also imagining being lifted up himself in a very fancy way. And the fact that he could get both of these things on the same day, Mordecai lifted up in death and him lifted up in glory. Amazing. So he shoots the moon and he asks for all of it. But remember, I mentioned earlier, this is like one of those comedies where all the characters are doing things that make sense, but they all misheard what was going on and their failed assumptions as they eavesdrop through the window or they read a note that isn't signed or isn't addressed to anyone. All of their assumptions go right to where their ego would take them. And then they act in keeping with those assumptions and when all of that collides, very funny things happen. And that is indeed exactly what we're getting here. Have you been to a stage production of a comedy recently, a musical comedy or anything? I've been to a couple this year and quite a few over the course of my life. I was raised around musical theater and like any genre of storytelling, there are certain story beats and humor beats that are really baked into that. And the misunderstanding comedy, when it's a stage production, is the kind of thing where you can visualize the incorrect assumptions and you can tell as you move toward act three after several near misses where the confusion didn't get sorted out. You can tell when you're finally getting right to that point where the cards will be turned over and somebody's going to be shocked to discover that they had the wrong assumptions about everything. And if the end of chapter five read like a dramatic story of four people looking out at the same pale moon as the sound of the construction of Haman's gallows echo through the empty city at night, you know, if that felt like a big dramatic scene, this to me feels like the high point, the payoff point of the whole big grand carefully constructed joke of a musical comedy. You can picture somebody playing Haman with all kinds of face makeup and he is moving to the front of the stage and the spotlights upon him and he's got his hands out as he pictures the size of the horse. And one of the king's nobles, he makes a mock bow of authority and power and maybe holds up an imaginary scepter must lead him through the town. There must be a crest on the horse's head and he outlines what the crest should look like and he imitates what the people will be doing as they fawn and fan themselves. So delighted that the person who the king is honored. Heck, maybe this would even happen in a hilarious song that is completely over the top about all the things that he's going to get. I mean, it kind of feels like an I want song in Disney, right? You know, the second song that happens in all the Disney movies where the Disney heroine sings about what she wants to do, get out of the tower and tangled, go be up on land and little mermaid, get out of this poor provincial town and experience something bigger and beauty in the beast. This feels like almost a late in the game. I want song except it's the bad guys I want song and now he's going to look like a total idiot. So after this elaborate description, Xerxes doesn't argue, not a bit. Apparently he thinks that sounds like a great plan for what to do with someone in whom the king delights. He says, go at once, get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate and do not neglect anything you've recommended. Esther's about a lot of things, but one of the things is about is dramatic reversals, reversals that are absolutely needed and reversals that are absolutely unlikely to happen, but the then do happen. And surely this is the biggest one of all to date because not only is Mordecai going to finally get his do, but Haman's not going to be able to run him through with a stick and put him up above the height of the city walls for everybody to see him all naked and dead and writhing around and stuff up there because he's going to be on the king's horse wearing the king's robe being led around by Haman, his mortal enemy as Haman is forced by the edict of the king. The same type of edicts he tries to manipulate and control for himself proclaiming how awesome Mordecai the Jew is and that this is a man in whom the king delights. And I would submit to you that as readers before we think any big lofty theological thoughts or anything like that, I would submit to you that we are supposed to delight in this little twist of fate as well. This moment is supposed to be fun and funny and it's the beginning of the end for this jerk, this abuser of power, this awful vile man, Haman, whose pride is as tall as his gallows, but whose fall is going to be even greater than that. Quick thing on the way out the door here. Thanks to everybody supports the program. A lot of you do that through patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. Any others of you do that through planning center through the website, the T M B H dot com slash support. Thank you so much to all of you. You're the reason that we can have this weird little corner of the internet where we hang out and do weird things and work through the Bible in the slowest imaginable way. But I think it's fun, right? I'm having fun. It seems like you're having fun. You're here. So for all of you, those of you who are in planning center, you should have an email in your inbox today with a whole bunch of music that Jeff has put together over the last few weeks. And for those of you over on patreon, I've made a few posts with some of those and another one with a couple more today. But for everybody who supports, I want to tease this a little bit. I've got a cool thing I've been working on for six weeks. It's a resource that I think is going to be a nice compliment to what we've been doing here in Esther. It is cool looking and I'm not ready to tell you more about it, but it's it's really neat and it's really creative and I'm grateful to the talented people who have been helping me with it. I'm excited to announce that in the next few days. So there's another I think really thoughtful, really cool resource coming to serve as a companion to what we're doing here in Esther for anyone who is supporting in any way. Thank you so much to everybody who does that. And also thank you to everybody who doesn't. I'm just glad we get to hang out together and do Bible stuff. I think it's real fun. All right. Now that's all I got. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
