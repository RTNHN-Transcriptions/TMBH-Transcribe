She's got blue eyes. She's a little white wolf. She's half Pomeranian, half Husky. She's fun, fun, fun, fun, and breathes life into our household. She's an idiot because she's a puppy, but she's figuring it out. She's going to grow into it. She's learned very quickly that I am the alpha of the pack and she behaves pretty dang well when I'm around. She can get a little rambunctious and mischievous and get into a little bit of trouble. When I'm not around, but when I'm there, things go pretty well. The other day I decided to take her risk. House is all clean. It's like a real sharp. I'm feeling good about it. I look out my window and there's somebody out there at the end of the driveway who I want to go greet real quick. I know it'll be very fast. I look over at the pup and I think, well, I'm going to let you just stay out and have the run of the house because I think you can handle that responsibility for a couple of minutes. I think you know what the expectations are around here. So I went and I talked with this person and it was even quicker tonight expected. It was a very quick conversation. Very nice. I came back in and in that brief amount of time that had elapsed, all destructive hurricane of chaos had broken loose at the hands of that little gremlin demon. She obliterated everything. She chewed up multiple items. She both turded the floor and urinated the floor just that quick. Both duties immediately. The only thing she didn't do was barf, but given the way everything else worked out, I would assume she just did that and scarf it down as well. I've been telling you, she's a puppy. She's an idiot, whatever. So I learned the lesson. Even two minutes and everything can completely fall apart if I'm not paying attention. She's just not ready for that kind of responsibility. But seriously, two minutes. How could you wreck everything that fast? So likewise, I think this is how Nehemiah must have felt after he left things in great shape in Jerusalem in 444 B.C. and went back to see Artaxerxes and cut bear for him probably for a few years or whatever, probably in Babylon and then came back and made a return trip to Jerusalem and discovered that the metaphorical puppy had metaphorically crapped all over the metaphorical carpet and chewed up all of the metaphorical things in a horrible destructive way, not metaphorically, incredibly quickly. Here's what happened. Nehemiah left things in really good shape. We celebrated that over our last few conversations. He's got all the right people descended from all the right people in all the right occupations. It's all funded. The paperwork is all done. Everything is working. They're giant walls up now. So people who want to wreck it, they're all outside the walls. They can't come in. The people have decided we're not going to intermarry with the people who want to destroy us. So we're not going to import bad ideas. Everybody stood up at giant ceremonies, multiple ceremonies and said, this is what we're going to do. This is how we're going to act. We're going to kick in on all of these things. Everybody acknowledged who the bad guys were from earlier on during the time of the rebuilding of the wall a few months ago. The people who tried to wreck everything like we're not going to hang out with them. They are bad. We're not going to exploit people anymore. We're going to make sure that the people who run the temple system are funded so they can just focus on that and manage this very important aspect of who we are. Nehemiah left everything perfect. There's a little bit of ambiguity about the timeline at this point as to exactly when it was the Nehemiah's time was up and when he left everything perfect. Some people read it as though he may be made multiple trips back and forth between Sousa and Jerusalem or even Babylon where the king would have occasionally done business and Jerusalem. Looks like it was a 55 day trip to Sousa and therefore 110 day round trips as possible that Nehemiah made multiple trips and kind of held on to this title of governor for a dozen years, 15 years, maybe even more. Another way to read the text as we get a little further into Nehemiah 13 is that Nehemiah actually stayed for a very long time on this first trip and that he was there for maybe a dozen years and it wasn't until the 32nd year of Artaxerxes that he made his first return trip to go back and serve the king as cut bearer again, in which case he had a really long time to implement the plan. The you and I were discussing yesterday. I tend to think logic and knowledge of how the Persian courts work dictates that he probably made multiple trips back and forth. But on one of these trips, he went away for an extended period of time and by the time he got back stuff was in pretty ugly disarray and that's what we get as we move forward in Nehemiah 13. There is a time jump that occurs between the stuff we looked at yesterday in Nehemiah 13 one through three where the book of Moses was read aloud. We have a time Q right there. It says on that day, the book of Moses was read aloud. So on the day of the rededication of the wall in we're saying 444 B.C. The book of Moses was also read aloud. All the people caught the thing about the Ammonites and the Moabites from Deuteronomy 23 and they're like, oh yeah, that's right. God said not to let them into our sacred assembly and then they were like, okay, well, let's take that even further and let's just not let's exclude all of the foreigners. Period. And we kind of let that on a hmm interesting. Maybe that's a good idea. Maybe that's not a good idea. Kind of note last time around. Then we get time jump from that little tidbit that is definitely occurring on the day of the rededication of the wall ceremony. We get a time jump to verse four to a moment in the future where maybe Nehemiah is coming gone several times or maybe he's been gone for a while and is just getting back depending on the translation it reads a little bit different. But I think we can cobble it together goes like this. Nehemiah 13 for time jump before this. Elia Sheeb the priest had been put in charge of the store rooms of the house of our God. Okay, no problem sounds like somewhere in there. Nehemiah's plan is continuing to play out. Elia Sheeb, I mean, he's the priest. He's been involved in a lot of these things. Remember, he's the guy who did the blessing, the dedication all the way back during the build montage and Nehemiah chapter three seems like it was a pretty good blessing. I guess good job in everything. And then there's another priestly dedication that we just looked at at the rededication of the wall seems like he's a good blesser and purifier, I suppose. Ooh, but then an old name who's caused us trouble in the past resurfaces in the second half of this verse. Elia Sheeb was closely associated with Tobiah. Oh, remember Tobiah, Geshim and Sanbalat are the unholy trinity of bad guys who would oppose everything about the rebuilding of the wall. Well, okay, Sanbalat, you might recall, was a Horonite. Geshim, you might recall, was referred to as the Arab, but do you remember what people group Tobiah was from? He's an Ammonite. Oh, remember just a second ago in Nehemiah 13 when all the people in the same day they rededicated the wall? Remember they read the stuff from Deuteronomy 23 and remember what two people groups? They were like, Oh, yeah, God said not to include them in the holy assembly. It's the Moabites and the Ammonites. Okay. I see what you're setting up here, Nehemiah. I see why you gave us that last little note about that detail from rededication of the wall day because the very next anecdote we get after the time jump is about an Ammonite who is causing problems. Well, should be no problem though, right? Because Tobiah is an Ammonite and all the people just made a big covenant and just agreed that they wouldn't let the Ammonites or the Moabites anywhere near the holy assembly. So they're not going to go near the temple. They're not going to go near any of the ancillary buildings around the temple. Should be no problem. There's a clear plan in place. Nehemiah 13, five, it continues. Okay. L.A. She was closely associated with Tobiah verse five and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles and also the tides of grain, new wine and oil prescribed for the Levite singers and gatekeepers as well as the contributions for the priests. What? What are you doing, man? L.A. She come on, dude, you're a really good blesser than a really good purifier. You knew all of the gestures and how to ceremonially clean things. You've been in a lot of really important events and stuff. You seemed cool. What are you doing, bro? Why are you roping Tobiah the Ammonite back in? I mean, let's just set aside the Ammonite thing for a second here. Let's just say, oh, wow, that was really mean and use modern standards of judgment for the Jewish people. And be like, that was really mean. You shouldn't have excluded the Ammonites. You guys are jerks. Even if we just go with Tobiah on his own merit, he is a problem. We know that he is a problem. Why are you bringing him back in, man? And why are you bringing him back in in such a way where what you cleared out this really important room that is part of the system that's been prescribed and set in place to make all of this work for the long haul. You cleared all that out. All of the place where we keep all the stuff that pays for the Levites. Where is all of that being kept now? Why is Tobiah in there? Why is he inside the walls? Why are you having anything to do with this man? Let alone so close to the seat of power and the seat of influence? Well, you might remember back earlier on here that all these guys were intermarried a whole bunch. And so there are all these complicating alliances with Sanballat and Geshim and Tobiah. All those names from the name song the other day, a whole bunch of them were married into the family of these three arch enemies of the Jewish people in the rebuilding project. And so all of them had exchanged property and land and title and last names and had grand kids in common with Tobiah and Geshim and Sanballat. They had exchanged dowries. They had contracts with each other. It was a big entangled mess. And for all the effort that had been made by Nehemiah and Ezra to unentangle things. Apparently, as soon as Nehemiah was gone, Elia, she felt like he knew better and immediately moves Tobiah, maybe the biggest thorn in their side, a gossip and a subvertor and a mocker and a tattle tale and a liar who wanted to defeat all of these good things that have happened. Elia, she moves that guy right into sacred space, space that is vitally important to the execution of Nehemiah's plan for making all of these reforms stick long term. So in the same way, I went to the end of the driveway and my little demon goblin palm ski tore up my house in like two minutes and I came back and I was like, how did you do that so fast? So I think Nehemiah is going to come back here and be like, seriously, I was only gone for a minute. And you did the exact opposite of all the things that we agreed to. How did you screw this up so fast? What the heck? Also final note, I'm really sorry. I kind of teased the idea that Nehemiah ended sort of positively. And now here we are getting toward the end and there's not really a lot of time for this new trajectory to resolve. It feels kind of bleak and I think there's a point to that. We're going to talk about the point to that, but I know, I know this is a bummer. We were all rooting for this to work out better and we haven't even reached rock bottom yet. There's more things that are going to go wrong. Oh well, Rain or Shine, we just do whatever's next in the Bible. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
