It was the only channel that we could get on the TV at the little cabin we were standing for our all getaway. MacGyver is a program that was on when I was a kid and I had an actor in it. I think his name was Richard Dina Anderson. He had a real gentle face. He seemed like just a nice guy. It was a nice show because he didn't use a gun. He wasn't really a detective or a crime fighter. In fact, I'm not totally sure what he did, but I know that everybody called him to buy his name multiple times in every single conversation. I know that he often wore stone washed jeans with a belt and a bright white sweatshirt tucked in to those stone wash jeans. He just used his brain to solve problems. And so while all the thugs and baddies are using guns, MacGyver would just come up with an overly elaborate solution to stuff. And then he'd defeat the people who had the firearms and whatnot. He doesn't see him entirely plausible given the effectiveness of firearms. But you know, it was a fun suspension disbelief for what I'm like. We had fun with it. It was a nice time watching the show that was a glimpse into a more innocent time with my kids. And there was a fugitive in this episode. He's a spoiled trust fund brat. He's going to murder somebody to cover his tracks. And so he starts some shenanigans. He's out driving around in his car with a license plate and everybody's trying to find him, but they can't. And then he breaks into a place by jumping over a fence. And that's it. And then he goes to a really pricey house and he just prize open a door with a crowbar and goes right in. And that's all of it. I just thought, wow, that's not really how crime works anymore. I got databases and drones and Chinese social credit score apps, the skies to social media. And you just can't really go anywhere like that. You're going to get found real, real quick just because your electronic signature and because your face kind of getting towards some kind of dystopian minority report stuff. So then right after that, I was working on some other stuff, some super old history stuff. And there's this great anecdote about the possibility that some legendary king from a long time ago that we'll talk about some other day died and got replaced by somebody who was impersonating him, but nobody knew because nobody was close enough to the king. So they couldn't tell just in the same week encountering those two stories. I was reminded that like it's really a very recent phenomenon that we know what everybody looks like. And that we can be like, Hey, you're that lady, aren't you? Back then there was a lot of possibility for sneaking around and doing spy stuff, disguising yourself, going places you weren't supposed to be. And in Matthew 26, Peter is going to take a run at taking advantage of that opportunity that was afforded in the pre-electronic age because he is still of a mind to follow Jesus. Now, look, I don't know what Peter is thinking at this point because earlier in Matthew chapter 26, even though Matthew doesn't name Peter specifically, we know it was Peter because all of this stuff about the arrest in the end of Jesus life sent all the gospel so we can compare notes on all of it. We know it was Peter. It was Peter and character wise, even if we didn't know it was Peter, we know it was Peter. So Jesus is going to get arrested and Peter gets out of sword and he's like, I'm going to stab ears. I'll show you and take on the whole world, just stabbing ears. And so he does. And Jesus is like, we're not knocking off. We're not doing any of that live by the sword. All of that stuff that we talked about before. You think about it, like just run through it in your brain. The whole story like, okay, then Jesus gets arrested and he gets hauled away somewhere. Where does everybody else go? I mean, it says that they fled and it says that, you know, as a reference to the Zechariah thing that we looked at about how the shepherd is going to get struck and the sheep are going to scatter. But where did they scatter to? And what would Peter do? Well, what Peter ends up doing is perfectly in keeping with his character. Verse 57 is right after the arrest, but then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Now 57, those who arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. We talked about Caiaphas a whole bunch. You get on that. But Peter followed him at a distance right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. Like it's just Peter, and he still looks like a Galilean. He's probably still dressed like a Galilean, but I guess there's a lot of hubbub, but you also got to figure like what kind of hubbub, what kind of chaos or noise or bustling is Peter, the clumsy spy trying to take advantage of here? Well, if it was a normal night at the house of Caiaphas, he's not going to get away with any of this. There's just not going to be enough chaos for him to blend in. But Peter seems crafty and opportunistic. He knows how to read the weather and read the water and be like, you know what, I can outsmart my prey by going right over here with this net and you got to be clever to be a fisherman. So maybe you're supplying some of those skills and he's like, Hey, we got chaos going on at the house of Caiaphas. And I might be able to just blend in, keep an eye on things. Does Peter still have his sword? I don't know. I would have to guess that he was dispossessed of that after he used it on somebody's ear, but maybe he just picked it up or maybe that's why we needed to have two swords. And he was like, Hey, other Simon Simon the zealot. I need, I need to remember that other sword from before the dinner. I need that. No reason. No, just no reason. Thank you. So I don't know. Maybe Peter's got a sword. Maybe he's milling around in here still insistent that he's going to use some sort of force or violence to protect Jesus. Maybe finally now he's given himself over to the reality that this is going to happen. Either way, he loves Jesus. This is his master. It's his friend. He sold out everything. He dropped his nets to go and follow this guy. He is all in and unashamedly all in. He metaphorically and literally stepped out of the boat and Jesus alone has the words of life. Where else would Peter go? So here Peter is trying to blend in and counting on the fact that nobody is going to be able to know what he looks like to get away with it. Now enough chaos has happened that maybe Peter totally forgot about that whole. You're going to deny me three times deal that Jesus said back in Matthew 2634. Maybe it's still on his mind and he's all clenched and puckered up and he's like, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. And it's all he's thinking about and he's doing his very, very best. But it's like, you know, when you go snowboarding and you look at the tree, you hit the tree. If you don't look at the tree, you don't hit the tree. You remember the analogy, maybe Peter's just staring down the tree too much here. I don't know what's going on in his head. This is a very chaotic time. It's very difficult for him, but you got to salute the guy's boldness, even if he has really no plan here for making the trip. Well, if we look at the Matthew account, we would get the impression that Peter went alone and that this trial, this thing that's happening under cover of darkness late at night, like remember, this isn't in the temple courts. It's still dark out and all of this is happening at a time when all of the people of the city who like Jesus so much are, you know, they're someone bed. They're maybe just starting to make preparations for the day, but this beginning of a trial, it's not happening in an official capacity. It's happening effectively behind closed doors. It's happening at Caiaphas' house. And we know that not from Marker Luke, both of whom read just about like Matthew, but we know that. Check that. Does Luke give us that? I think Luke maybe does give us that detail. What would this be? 22? Now I want to know. Okay. All right. Peter's okay. Denial. It'd be about right there. Yeah. Luke 22, 54, then seizing him, him being Jesus. They led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed a distance and then you go over to John, though, and we fill in a few more details here that I think are really interesting, but understandably not particularly relevant to Matthew. Over in John, we got, okay, they came there arrested Jesus. They bound him and brought him, John 1813, first to Ennis, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Again, we broke all of the Ennis Caiaphas stuff down. If you don't remember that, you can go listen to the last few episodes. Those guys, just like the text says here, they're related stool pigeons, appointees of the governor of Judea for a very long period of time. The Ennis Caiaphas era of the high priesthood is something that went on for a long time. And Caiaphas, of course, he's the state appointed mediator. He's the world system appointed mediator between God and man. And Jesus is the God appointed mediator between God and man. So this is going to be weird. Caiaphas was the one who advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people more on that later. Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard. But Peter had to wait outside at the door, the other disciple who was known to the high priest came back, spoke to the girl on duty there, and brought Peter in. Okay, so we get a little bit more of the picture here of what Peter's plan looks like and how this all unfolded. Anytime John talks about an anonymous disciple, he means him. The disciple that the high priest knew is John. John was from a family of some influence, some finances, looks like John's family maybe held property in the north and in Jerusalem itself. That'll come up as we get further into the text at some point, I'm sure. And so John is using his privilege here to gain access, but Peter has to wait outside. Now it's really interesting because you kind of think that maybe Caiaphas would know John is associated with Jesus. Does he know that? I mean, as he talks to John's family, is he in the loop on all of that? And Caiaphas is still just okay with two of Jesus' disciples being around maybe. But the response of the other people that we're going to look at later in Matthew 26 and that comes next in John 18 indicates that it wasn't broadcast. I mean, Peter's trying to hide his identity. He's willing to lie about his associations with Jesus. So there's a little bit of a curiosity there as to how John's access to the house didn't betray John and Peter's relationship with Jesus, but did get Peter access. Maybe John was the same age as that girl that he was talking to and they were pals from school or something. And so he was able to pull a few strings without betraying anything. I don't know. What I do know is that it looks like Matthew isn't interested in giving us the detail about first speaking with Anas because, well, even according to John, it doesn't look like really much of anything happened in the conversation with the old high priest. It looks like it picks up right back with the new high priest, the current high priest, Caiaphas, as the narrative moves along in John 18 and that corresponds to what we're getting over here in Matthew chapter 26. So now you're getting one of those big dramatic act three sequences like you get in all the Star Wars movies where two bits of action or sometimes three are unfolding at once. You got a battle in space and Han and Leia. They got to get that shield generator down. And also you got Luke on the bridge there, the death star having a showdown with the darker side of himself and his father and the emperor. And we're bouncing between all of those scenes. We're getting that now. We're inside. Jesus is about to get a little bit roughed up. He's being questioned harshly. We got the big showdown there between these two superpowers and outside we've got drama about what's going to happen to Peter, who is sneaking probably with sneaky spy music going in the background, but he's just too hamfisted and clumsy to get away with this. We all know he's going to get caught. The only question is how's it going to be when he does get caught so much fun, such a good story. We've got a couple new episodes of good ideas for churches up. I've got a great interview coming up on that other podcast as well. If you work at a church or doing kind of ministry stuff or you know anybody who does, you might like the good ideas for churches podcast that is mostly handled by my buddy, Aaron Eutec, but that I don't know I work on. I help him with I try to make the thing go. So I really like what's happening over there with good ideas for churches. You might like it as well. You can go check that out if you want to or you can also not if you would rather not because of it's the internet. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
