This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. My little guy is playing Little League Baseball this year and I adore it. It's such a fun thing. I mean, the baseball is not great, but they are getting better. It's been fun to see the improvement. I get to umpire occasionally, but mostly I get to sit up in the crow's nest and call the game and pick the music. I'm really having fun with that. I'm trying to pick the most thematically inappropriate, not like content wise inappropriate, just thematically inappropriate music I can. It's been really fun. We did greatest hits of Rogers and Hammerstein night at the ballpark with all the inning transition music being from musicals. I did another with the swinginess hits of the big band era. I did a bunch more with the greatest hits of Bach Beethoven, the Baroque and Romantic era than I did a Michael Bolton Kenny G night. I think that was everybody's favorite. It's just really fun. People have a good sense of humor. They're 10 year old kids and my boy is so fun to watch because everybody gushes about their kid. How far do I want to go down this road? He's sweet. He's a kind little fellow. He loves his mom. He loves his dad. He loves life and everybody and is filled with joy all the time. When he comes up to bat, he doesn't really like to have the helmet all the way on because he wants to see better. The thing sticks way up and is crooked way back because he doesn't like the bill getting in the way of watching the pitches. The bat's kind of heavy for him. He's not a huge dude. He walks up and every time he does, he smiles the whole way to the plate because he gets to bat. Then he looks for people in the crowd who he knows and loves, particularly me and Camilla. He's real big at us and it's so fun because all the moms and grandmas put their hands over their hearts when he does. They're like, oh, he did the thing again. It's just adorable and delightful and innocent. If he wins or loses or whatever, he just likes trying real hard and he cheers for all of his teammates, even in situations where probably the baseball etiquette thing to do would be like, yeah, we're down 19. Maybe putting on the rally cap and cheering wildly for my buddy when they're two outs in the bottom of the last inning of the game and we're down 19. Nobody's on base. Maybe it doesn't make any sense, but it doesn't matter. He's just got this irrepressible, contagious joy and I love him without it, but I love him with it. If you can picture those attributes that are natural to kids, that sadly, we often watch get choked out over the course of life and a series of disappointments. If you can picture that beauty and sweetness and optimism that some people hold on to, but that most kids have in spades, then you can appreciate what's going on in Matthew chapter 18, starting in verse one. At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? He called a little child and had him stand among them and he said, I'll tell you the truth. Unless you change and become like little children, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. It's a pretty easy setup here in terms of what's going on contextually. Chapters 16 and 17 have raised the stakes within Jesus' inner circle. There's been all this pressure from the outside. Every time Jesus comes back to civilization and where people know him, he's getting bombarded with things and people are mad at him. They're trying to figure out what they're going to do to stop him. And then Jesus does a northern road trip with his guys. They head up to Caesarea Philippi and I imagine it happening around campfire. Jesus is like, hey, who does everybody say I am? They're like, John Baptist come back from dead or Elijah or Jeremiah or something. He's like, yeah, but what are you guys? Who do you say I am? And Peter's like, you know what? I'm just going for it. You're the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of the living God. And Jesus is like, yep, you nailed it. And from there on, he pivots toward the home stretch with his guys and the stakes do get raised because now they see him in some of his transcendent eternal glory in the next chapter. He spells out explicitly for them moving forward from that confession of Peter that he's going to have to go to Jerusalem and face death, but then also be raised back to life. And that death is going to happen at the hands of the religious leadership. And so we got all this pressure mounting and we have the disciples working through the idea that Jesus is going to die and that there's an expiration date on this whole moment in life. And we're going and where did their heads go? Their heads go to what happens after? What do we get? Who's going to be in charge? Like, okay, we've only got a little bit of time left. The 12 of us here, we're all obviously jockeying for position. That's what we all do. You give a pretty ringing endorsement to Peter. And I was just wondering, I guess, since you are going to die, if that's final, has that been decided? The Peter is like first among equals or gets to represent us or be our spokesperson. Is there any possibility that that list is still fluid? What could we do to obtain the title greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And obviously this is one of those Bryce Harper in the interview, his rookie year kind of moments where it's like clown question, bro. You guys are totally missing the point. This had to have been discouraging. I don't know if you can discourage God in the flesh, but frustrating, irritating, agitating for Jesus and indicator of where they're at for Jesus and that these guys, they're thinking about what they're going to get out of the deal. They're thinking about how far ahead they can get. And they're thinking about trying to impress Jesus so that they can out maneuver their buddies and their rivals to win some kind of silly game. And that's not what he's setting him up for. He's setting him up to be the torchbearers of this kingdom, the physical manifestation of this kingdom that he's been initiating and talking about. So that seems to be the emotional narrative run up to this thing, the headspace narrative of the disciples, the guys as we get into this passage. So they asked this dumb question. This isn't the only time a question like this gets asked. The James and John, they're constantly wanting to figure out who's going to be in the best position. You got some moms advocating for their disciple kids for quality position in the afterlife or in this grand kingdom that's going to happen after they imagine this reckoning. Everything is going to occur. Again, it's just a sign of not getting it. And Jesus could do one of the two things he often does in these situations. Thing number one is be pretty direct and correct. The behavior that is what we see with Peter chapter, well, just over a chapter earlier now when Peter's like, no, you're not going to die. I will never let that happen. And he's like, yeah, get behind me, Satan. It's a direct smackdown of the language. And Jesus repudiates it fully. Well, then the other approach we see Jesus taking when the disciples are being dumb is he comes back and he teaches, he gives a little nugget of rabbinical wisdom is like here. Think about this word picture in this example. And this time around, he uses the example of the heart of a child. Now right off the bat, we can see this is a negative contrast between the heart of the disciples and this moment and the heart of this free spirited little kid with his batting helmet on goofy, walking up to the plate with his oversized uniform, grinning and smiling at things and not carrying all of the cares of the world, but just trusting that he's in a safe environment and this is a place where we can play and it's all approved and let's just have fun and be light about it. So he calls a little child and had him come and stand among them. That's verse two and then verse three again, as I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven. Well, what's the immediate contextual difference here between what they were doing and what these little children are doing? Well, they are scheming and conniving and in pursuit of power, self-exaltation, control. That's the stuff they want. And it's been fashionable in Christian philosophy and secular philosophy alike for two millennia and very fashionable in the last 200 years, post age of absolute monarchs and gigantic mega states in the old world. It's been very fashionable for us to try to unpack what happened there, to unpack this human lust for power and control. Lord Acton is one of the famous thinkers who quipped, I believe in the late 19th century, that absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely Nietzsche wrestled with these kind of questions. And at this point in history, I don't think we're thinking very critically about that anymore, like the generations that immediately preceded us did. I feel like we're in sort of a dark, disappointing moment of being like, everybody's jocky in for power. Everybody wants power. The question isn't, is power a good idea or not? The question is, who's going to get it and I want it to be my team? And I think it's one of the great ethical crises of our moment in history and our spirit of the age, that is our unflinching agreement from all corners of thought that the relentless pursuit of power for our own ends is a good idea and a moral pursuit. I'm not sure that necessarily passes the test of reason or morality or philosophy or history. All of that said, let me tell you who is not in this example in the profound pursuit of power and their own glory. It's some kid just goofing around with their helmet on, throwing rocks in the air, goofing around, wrestling in the dirt, laughing, chasing, whatever. I think those were Van Morrison lyrics on accident. It isn't that guy. I mean that kid, that little girl, that little boy running around, they're just doing life. They don't even really think about power that much. They think about trust. Mom and Dad have authority in my life and they love me and provide for me and care for me. And they provide justice for me when I'm at odds with my sisters and my brothers or even neighbor kids. And that trust is the defining relational attribute of their childhood. And I think that is the contrast we are supposed to draw between the disciples power mongering in these little kids. And then Jesus takes it a step beyond a contrast and is like, look, unless you adopt the posture of this little kid, you're not going to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Now you saw what I was doing just a second ago there with all of the stuff describing the relational trust that a kid has with a parent and all of those elements that I just listed out there, all of the elements of the Lord's prayer. How then should you pray? You should pray like this, a prayer of dependence, a prayer of childlike trust toward your father, toward the king. And if that is your attitude, you have assumed a right posture before the king in this kingdom. And that right posture before the king, that right attitude before the king is a pretty big indicator according to the teaching of Jesus of what it looks like to be in the kingdom. The disciples right now were not acting in accordance with kingdom values. They were not acting in accordance with the prayer template that I assume they had been repeating since the Sermon on the Mount since Jesus said this then is how you should pray. They were out of step with the values of the kingdom. And so when he brings over this little kid, it is in keeping with the larger gospel books motif of here are the people who should be getting it, but they're not. And here's the people who shouldn't be getting it. These outsiders, these blind people who theoretically shouldn't be able to see, but then they do see where these kids who shouldn't get anything at all or these religiously illiterate people or these uninspired, unimpressive people. And yet all of them have eyes to see. All of them seem to be able to get it. And the people who should be getting it who've propped up their own glory and are worried about their own glory, those people aren't getting it. But motif is on display again in this little spot. What a happy time for me to consider this passage and the mindset of my joy-filled little boy who I have the privilege of dadding right now and tucking in at night and watching his optimism and delight at everything around him, watching his growth. What a beautiful thing that is for me to get to be a dad right now in this phase, but also what a valuable thing it is for me to get to consider a passage just like this as I watch stuff that my kid has down intuitively, but that with the worries of adulthood and the worries about my own dignity and my own place and things, that maybe I don't have down quite as well.
