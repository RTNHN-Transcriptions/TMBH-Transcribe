I mean, every now and then we do some, we're talking about the Africa renewal thing right now, which is sort of a sponsorship, sort of a partnership that's a little bit different. It's not really where you buy a product. It's where you go and sponsor a kid and just make their lives better. But in general, I don't do a ton of sponsorship on this program, just because it's quick. We don't have a ton of time to get into it. But on my other podcast, no dumb questions that I do with my buddy Destin, we have sponsorship on pretty much every episode. It's part of how I pay the bills as a human who does this for a living. And one of the great things about the products that we get to work with there is it's only stuff that we really like. We don't do any kind of sponsorship with things we think are dumb or even that we only sort of like. We send us over little talking points from time to time, but for the most part, we don't really need them. We just turn on microphones and we're like, Hey, if you get Hello Fresh, you get really good food that you're going to like. And if you get Casper mattress, you're really going to like sleeping on it and bomb a sock. So they're shaped like this and they feel really good. And in general, that's what you do when you have something that you want people to sign up for and that you think is a great idea. You tell them what they're going to get. And usually it's good, but Jesus is either terrible at marketing or is playing a completely different game here because whenever he does his sponsorship plugs in the Bible, he definitely leads with here are all the things that are going to happen that might hurt if you decide to sign up and follow me. Like remember that one time where the guy comes up to Jesus and like, I'll follow you wherever you go. And Jesus is like, yeah, I'm homeless. Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the son of man has no place to lay his head. And then the other guy's like, cool, I'm in, but let me go bury my dad. And Jesus is like, yeah, follow me and let the dead bury their own dead. Both of those things are really bad plugs because you got two potential new clients here and both of them are all rearing to go. And then Jesus totally dampens their expectations. Then you get to Matthew 13 and you have all of the business about the kingdom parables. And it looks like everything's going great. And he has all these parables that totally lower expectations. He's like, yeah, most people are probably not going to be down to this. They're going to look at it in three quarters of the types of soil on which the seed lands. It's just not going to take and work out in the long haul. It won't really return to harvest. And time and again, you and I have marveled over the course of 16 chapters at Jesus relentless insistence on disclosing how the things are going to be, what it's going to look like if you sign up, what it's going to cost you if you sign up. We have Jesus telling you specifically on the front end, like, Hey, make sure to add this thing up before you jump in because it's costly. It's a big deal. Now, clearly he's suggesting that life is at the other end of it and that the only thing that makes sense or is true is on the other end of this thing. But it is not like a podcast promotion in that here's just everything that's awesome. Here's all the stuff that you get and you pay this very small price. In fact, you pay even a little bit less if you use the discount code and DQ 10 or TMBH. And that's great. I mean, that makes perfect sense for operating in the marketplace. That is how things ought to be. But on this most profound of things, it's all flipped. It's upside down like the whole kingdom of God in general. Here's everything that's costly about this. And let me just lead with that. So there's no impression of cooking the books to get people to sign up for this thing under false pretenses. And that is exactly what we are getting. Oh, again, in Matthew chapter 16, right after Peter confesses that Jesus is the Christ and Jesus is like a roger that great job that's from God that's cool. And also I'm going to go to Jerusalem and I may get killed and then be raised to life on the third day. And Peter instead of being like, what? Tell us more about the raised to life thing and the defeating death forever part. And said, he's like, no, let's talk about the part where you die for a whopping total of three days. No way, Jesus, Peter pulls him aside and barks at him. He's like, no, we're not doing that. I'll never let that happen. And then Jesus says to him the same stuff that he said to Satan himself. Jesus turned and said to Peter, get behind me Satan. You're a stumbling block to me. You don't have in mind the things of God, but the things of men. And I told you yesterday that it doesn't end on that rebuiki note, though it turns out down the road that Peter really didn't have his head totally screwed on straight on this stuff. And when push came to shove in that moment, Peter actually was going to get it wrong. In fact, Peter is going to boast again about how loyal he is and then double get it wrong, which is an even worse look for him because he's the one guy who was bragging all the time about how he was going to get it right and how he had Jesus back. And then he's the guy who most didn't when the rubber actually met the road. But as promised, Jesus flips this thing around to some positive, redirective teaching for the disciples. So Jesus turns to all of the disciples here in verse 24 after having this sidebar with Peter verse 24, then Jesus said to his disciples, if anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it. What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? For the son of man is going to come and his father's glory with his angels and then it will reward each person according to what he's done. I tell you the truth, some who were standing here will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom. We'll unpack that last line later on because I understand it's a little bit tricky. The earlier stuff all fits this same pattern of what from a market perspective would be terrible marketing, but from the upside down values of the kingdom perspective is right on brand for Jesus. So he starts by saying, if you want to come after me, you got to deny yourself and take up this cross and follow me. So now we're getting a little hint, a little foreshadowing of what this death he's starting to point to is going to look like and it's like the worst kind you can have. Just a few pages earlier, this whole death idea is still vague imagery related to Jonah being in the belly of the whale. And all of a sudden we've fast forwarded all the way to, yeah, I'm getting nailed to a cross and I'm going to die or at least that is what he seems to be in toning because if you want to follow Jesus, he's saying you got to take up your cross and follow him. In other words, Peter, like that's where I'm going and that's what you would need to do if you want to follow me. Now isn't it interesting that church tradition and pretty well established church tradition says that after all of the fumbling and bumbling and hamfistedness of Peter's story, he does eventually end up following Jesus in that way. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but everyone wants to lose his life for me will find it. This is a motif that you and I have talked about a bunch already. It's the Sphinx from Mystery Men motif. It's the, well, this is this way, but remember the values of the kingdom are upside down. So it's actually this way, whoever wants to be first will be last. And across the gospels, we see Jesus hit this kind of language in response to whenever the disciples start boasting or clamoring for him to judge and destroy people or when a couple of brothers get together and argue about who should get to sit in which seat of privilege and authority. That's when Jesus breaks out this stuff that lines up world kingdom values next to kingdom values and rearranges it verbally so that everybody's like, oh, yeah, that's right. We're supposed to be reoriented to this other thing, this upside down kingdom with the values that deep down everybody really wants and that are sustainable because there's an eternal king behind them. What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul for the son of man is going to come with his father's glory in the angels and he reward each person according to what he's done. So we get a threefold argument from Jesus here in light of that. The first reason to diet itself to take up this cross and follow Jesus is that there's actually life in that and you can't actually hold on to your own life that only through this diminishing of self and exaltation of God is their actual life. Now world kingdom values would say the opposite. But remember, everything's upside down here and so it works in the exact opposite way of what we would normally expect and what is established and reinforced by nature, which is if you want to get ahead, you got to get ahead. If you want to be healthy, you got to be healthy. If you want to win at things, you got to try to win at things. So the first argument is it seems like you can preserve your life, but you can't. The only way to life is in death to self and life in Christ. And then the second reason to take up this cross is the one about how wealth is an illusion. Jesus addresses that in the middle of the sermon on the mount. I think that's 6 and 19 through, I don't know, after 19. And in that chunk, that's where you get the store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where mouth and rust do not destroy and where thieves don't break in and steal because this stuff lasts and where your treasure is, there your heart will be also same kind of language. So the point here again is world kingdom values. If you want more stuff, you could get more stuff in kingdom, kingdom values. If you want to have true riches or be a part of that, which is truly valuable, you move on from those things. You use them only in the sense of the parable of the shrewd manager in Luke chapter 16 as a way to invest in those things which do not perish and last forever. And then the third part of the argument for taking up your cross and dying to self if you're a follower of Jesus is that there's an end game to all of this. And even though it might seem like the world kingdom values are forever and immutable, it's not true. These kingdom kingdom values that are right there below the surface and that exist among the followers of Jesus and in the eternal kingdom of God, that's going to become fully visible later on. And it's like the parable in chapter 13 hinted at where in the end the angels and Jesus come back and they sort everything out. Well, in that sorting out all the world kingdom values get dispensed with and all of the kingdom kingdom values become evident to everybody. And that's just how the things are moving forward. So in light of this threefold argument, something that sounds on its surface to be crazy, take up your cross and follow Jesus died a self for the exaltation of this homeless guy. All of a sudden, if these truths of the kingdom, if there is such a kingdom where there is such a king and these upside down values do exist, then Jesus makes a lot of sense here. And the investment in the world kingdom doesn't make a lot of sense. Had a cool thing come in the other day. Somebody sent my wife this text and it just tickled me. It's this little girl on a scooter and her mom's talking to her. Listen to this. Oh, that makes me so happy. Jeff banged out that silly bonus episode song for a Saturday episodes in like half an hour. He knows what to do. He's a wizard. He's a magician. It's amazing. It seemed like a great opportunity for me to remind you of the 400th episode Easter egg music contest that we have running in the background right now. It's not too late to jump in. Everyone is invited. Whoever emails to me the most comprehensive, accurate list of explanations for all the bonus Easter egg music that Jeff has provided for the podcast, not just what the song is or who did it, but why it fits and why it's in there. Whoever gives me the best email is going to win a gigantic, glorious prize that you totally want and it's not going to be a fistful of warm mayonnaise loose in a bubble wrap envelope. Like it was that one other time. It's going to be like legitimately rad. Jeff slays it on the music. He's doing the music for the new podcast that I'm going to launch soon and tell you about here in a little bit and he puts a ton of work into all of this and I just think he's great. I think it's a super fun little bonus element to what we get to do together. This seems like an enjoyable way to celebrate that and the fact that we're coming up on 400 episodes, which is pretty cool too. So thanks everybody who's putting work into the Easter egg music game that we have cooking. Thanks to Jeff for doing that. Thanks to all of the rest of y'all for hanging out and doing this business. I'm Matt. Join the Bible Hour podcast and let's do this again soon..........", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 12.0, "text": " There's not a ton of sponsorship on this podcast, and that's
