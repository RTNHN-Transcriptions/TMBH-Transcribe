It's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour and I am unashamed, though I probably should be ashamed. I'm unashamed to admit that I really like the Denver Broncos. They're a football team here in the United States of America that used to be good at football. It was really fun when they were good at football, but now they're terrible at football. But when they were good, at times I get to a place where I really needed other teams to lose in order for the Broncos to make the playoffs or get the position and the playoffs you want them to get. That's fine. It's really easy to root against other football teams. No problem. Where it gets weird is when the team that needed to beat the team that I needed to lose was one of the teams that I'm supposed to hate as a Broncos fan. I'm really not supposed to like the New England Patriots or the Kansas City Chiefs or the whatever city they play in this month Raiders. And at times I've had to root for these despised franchises that are age old, historical rivals of my team. It's just weird to make common cause with the Raiders, the Chiefs or the Patriots. Now, this is of course irrelevant at this point because I stress once again, my team is irrelevant and terribly, terribly bad at football. But hey, the heart loves what the heart loves. What can you do? Likewise, in Matthew chapter 22, we run into one of these situations where two very rival teams find themselves in a situation where they're rooting for each other when under any other circumstance, they would never be rooting for each other. And these two rival teams are the Pharisees who we've talked about a ton over the course of our conversation, working our way through the book of Matthew and the Herodians who haven't really come up. But if you're paying attention, I mean, Herodians, it has Herod right there in the name so you can kind of figure out who these people are or where they might fit. Well, I want to unpack this a little bit because this is one of those moments where we go through the text and we're like, okay, now Matthew 22 15 was a sin. Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him and his words him as Jesus there. They said their disciples to him along with the Herodians and they asked our question, which we talked about yesterday, which we're going to get in more next time around. It'd be easy to just look at that and be like, okay, some people we don't know or care about anymore got together with some other people we don't know or care about anymore. And they're both going to go after Jesus and just to assume that these are probably like the same kind of people, but they're not the same kind of people. And the fact that they are so different and working together really says something about the situation and even more so it would have immediately conjured ideas in the minds of the original audience members about whoa, the Broncos and the Raiders are on the same team here. What the heck is going on? Whoa, the Pharisees and the Herodians are getting along. This is strange. That makes me take notice. And so we're just going to take them and try and figure out who these people were and where they fit. Well, the Pharisees we've talked about before, they're one of the two really big political religious sects at the time of Jesus in the first century AD. You got the Sadducees and you got the Pharisees. The Pharisees theoretically believe that some Messiah character is going to come from the line of David and fulfill all of the outstanding promises of God to his people to redeem that are there and the Old Testament and the law and the prophets and all of that business. And their job in the meantime is kind of to be these conservative caretakers of things and tell the Messiah comes. They make sure everyone is obeying the law and keep a close eye on stuff. They make sure behaviors where it needs to be. They're like the steward of Gondor. They just sit on the throne that is ultimately going to be occupied by somebody else. But they're just like keeping it warm and eating super gross squishy tomatoes decadently while they wait around for that to happen. So these people are still expecting that the religious promises of God that we saw manifest in the first temple era way, way back in the time of Solomon and moving forward in the second temple era and the time of Ezra after the exile to Babylon and moving forward. They think that those promises are still coming to fruition, that the Messiah is going to be a thing and their job is to point people in that direction and make sure everybody's heads up when the whole Messiah thing goes down. Now the Herodians, they're a completely different animal. The Herodians look like a significantly minority political, social, religious party and an interest group that existed at this time. We wanted to see the Herod family firmly entrenched as the direct governors of specifically Judea but also Galilee. I understand why any of that matters. I guess I got to step back and frame it up just a little bit more. At the time of the New Testament and Matthew chapter 22 here, the Roman Empire is like, I don't know, a few decades old, not much. It's still a pretty fresh thing. There's only been one really big great grand super swell emperor and that was Caesar Augustus who gets referenced quickly in the Bible in the beginning of Luke. And it's about to get a lot weirder in terms of what the role of emperor looks like. But the emperors can't be everywhere at once. The Senate is a puppet organization at this point. And so the Roman model of governance over this Mediterranean world is based on this client king relationship. And what the Romans would do is they would go and they would find some sort of ethnic ruler or local ruler who wouldn't be so loyal to the ethnic or political or cultural history of the people they're from that they would side with those people, but they'd be familiar enough with it than that client king would be a pacifier for the people. And they would have a duty and a relationship with the throne with the emperor. And the deal there was a client king would provide taxes and order and Rome would provide security and would prop up the authority of this client king and whatever dynasty would flow out of this client king. Now originally the deal that was struck was between Herod the Great and Caesar Augustus very early in the days of the Roman Empire. Remember he had a Roman Republic for hundreds of years before this. Julius Caesar is one of the last big famous figures in this. He gets assassinated. Everything spirals. There's a big civil war, Anthony and Cleopatra suicide in there somewhere. The Senate loses out and Octavian or as he would be known later Caesar Augustus wins out. And at this point it's like why are we keeping up the facade of a Republican or a Republican anymore? And so the rules are different. And early in the game Herod the Great he and his dad before him kind of read the writing on the wall and started to curry favor with the people they thought were going to win out in this whole mad scramble for power at the end of the Republic in the beginning of the Empire. And what do you know the Herod family guessed right? They curried favor with Octavian Caesar Augustus and Caesar Augustus rewarded them by making them the ethnic client king over Judea and effectively Galilee as well. Now Herod the Great was a pretty reliable agent for the Romans but he got super weird in his old age and it's always stabbing members of his family and other kooky stuff like that. And in the end the transfer of power from Herod to his absolutely broken children who came after him. And so he was really badly and Rome was like all right Judea just can't be a client king state. This is too volatile that's never going to work. Sorry what we're going to do here instead is direct Roman rule and that's where you get characters like Pontius Pilate a direct Roman ruler. Now that isn't to say that the Herod family doesn't have some influence there but it's not really a true client king state anymore after like four or five six AD somewhere in there. After that some of these lesser territories that aren't Judea which really was a pretty prized possession. I mean there's a lot of history a lot of wealth a lot of population there a lot of merchant activities a valuable province but these other ones rounded they're not as big a deal. And so there's a pseudo client king relationship between Herod Antipas in the northern region another state that being Galilee there's a client king relationship still there at the time of Matthew chapter 22 between Herod Antipas and at this point it's the Roman emperor Tiberius and the Herod family is constantly trying to make the emperors happy like look we made a town we called it Tiberius we could even rename the Sea of Galilee the Sea of Tiberius who would that possibly offend. So they're trying really really hard but as you might remember Herod Antipas and his family and their mess they're murdering each other just like their dad did and they're marrying the sister-in-law and everything and John the Baptist criticized that that's why he ended up without a head at the hands of Herod and his goofy super sexy dancing party girl and all of this ends up in a place where we get to Matthew chapter 22 and you've got of course the Pharisees who are like we're going to keep things together with as much Jewishness as we can and somehow our religion is going to win out and there's a very conservative restore Israel kind of mindset here the Sadducees are a little bit more of a liberal accommodating group but apparently it looks like there was this minority group called the Herodians who are like we want our client king state back and we would like the Herod's to occupy that role again that was stripped from us by the home office we want that relationship back. So their agenda was not like let's get rid of Rome it was like let's get the scraps from Rome's table a little bit more neatly arranged and make those scraps a little bit better and that's what they wanted. So here's what's crazy my friends the fact that these two teams are coming together to get after Jesus is not think about what the Pharisees are doing here the Pharisees think there is going to be a Messiah they think the redemptive plan of God is all going somewhere and if anything the Pharisees are being very shrewd and very clever biting their time with the occupying Romans to get things to where they think they need to be ultimately the Herodians are entirely pragmatists they completely cooperating with the occupiers in every way and would like to strike bargains to make that occupation be a little more fun for them. They don't have any kind of interest in a Messiah they don't think of a Messiah in those categories at all and yet these two both feel sufficiently threatened by Jesus that they come out with a unified show of force and try to trap him with Caesar stuff now you get why the Herodians would be like well should you pay taxes to Caesar because they're Herodians totally like Rome to the answer to them would be well absolutely how else can we have nice things that's the price you pay for living in a civil society whereas the Pharisees probably deep down are more like only if you absolutely have to but the second we are able to get rid of Rome we are going to get rid of Rome and for the Pharisees to partner with the Herodians here is a dramatic rejection of the notion of Jesus as Messiah we're not even considering or debating or looking at that like we're the ones who decide when the Messiah happens we're the kingmakers on this one and you ain't it and we'll even side with people who completely reject all of our convictions to make you go away again to you and me I don't know just couple names of a couple groups from a real long time ago and I guess whatever they showed up at the same party and they yelled about some things that had a fight or whatever I don't know I don't care but imagine if say Rachel Maddow and Tucker Carlson got together to go and argue against someone can you imagine anything that would cause those two at this point in the conversation if you're not familiar with who I'm talking about don't worry about there's very left and very right very different people but can you imagine anything that would get those two to be like we have got to come together this is a real problem we see it the same way and we're going to use all of our conniving and influence and cleverness to weasel this person into the dirt so that our things can be preserved we have to make common cause Rachel Maddow you've never been more right nor more attractive to me than you are right now Tucker Carlson let's do this thing it just ain't happening in the same way that if you're familiar with American cable news at all like that scenario that hypothetical just really popped for you then you can understand how wild it would be and how much it would have really popped for the original audience that these two strange bedfellows were coming together to be rid of Jesus. Alright we're going to break down how that conversation went a little bit more next time around I'm Matt this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast let's do this again too.", "segments": [{"id": 0,
