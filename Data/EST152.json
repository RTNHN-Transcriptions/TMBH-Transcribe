I don't know most of the things about the Bible. It's a very big book. It's a very complex book. The superintendents of God that I think is very evident behind it makes it hang together in weird and surprising ways. You don't see comment on your first pass or second pass or third pass or eighth pass or 50th pass. It was just a lifetime of stuff here to unpack and look at it's not like other books because its origins aren't like other books. And even people who don't believe as I do that the God of the universe is behind it have still found this to be wildly compelling. I know there are a whole bunch of you who are here having this conversation with me right now and say, yeah, that's exactly me. I'm not sure what to make about the God of the universe behind it thing, but the book is different than other books. It sits different and reads different. It lingers different than other books. And so like I was saying, I don't need another reminder that it's amazing and that it's bigger than me and that I don't own this thing and that I didn't write this thing and that I am not the nowhere and keeper of the flame of all wisdom. I am a student here. We are students together. And I'm always learning stuff and that hit me again here about five minutes ago as I was sitting down to start working on Esther chapter nine and talk about that with you, my friends and I read the first verse here and I was like, oh, wait a minute. I think it was wrong about what the theme verse of this book is, which means that I probably duplicated that mistake in the episode I made earlier this year in season two where we went through the Bible one book per day. And I was like the theme verse central verse of Esther is this one you got to read it. Is it? Okay. Here's what I'm working on. I'll be interested to hear what you think about this. Esther nine one on the 13th day of the 12th month, the month of the Dar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. Okay. So we're getting to go time here on this day. The enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them. Okay. And just a minute, I'm going to tell you why I think this might be the theme verse of Esther. But first, do you remember which one I was theorizing it might be before or because you guess? I mean, it's one that everybody points to in Esther, right? It's the end of chapter four and it's the line that is demonstrative of Esther's courage and her growth as a character and it's great. It's dramatic. It's wonderful. And it's very important, but like I've already said three or four times, I'm second guessing I guess in Esther chapter four. This is the part where we're coming off. Haman's edict being sent out and the king and Haman are like, awesome. And they sit down and they grab some drinks, but the Citadel of Sousa is bewildered and then Mordecai finds out about it and he puts on the sackcloth and he goes around town public morning. And then finally, the maids and eunuchs of Esther connect with Mordecai and Mordecai starts sending her messages, right? And Esther comes out of her blissfully unaware state as she lives in the nicest place to live in the entire world at this point in history and she gets this message, shakes her out of that. And understandably, it takes her a minute to get her situation because that kind of environment has something of a lotus effect. It's intoxicating. You sort of forget time and it seems like anything that you would do outside of that massive comfort is going to be a downgrade. And so understandably, it's a little tough for her to figure it out, but Mordecai has to kind of buy a proxy, grab her behind the shoulders and the shaker a little bit. And I like it's not too much. She's like gentle shaking to be like snap out of it. And she does snap out of it and she realizes that Mordecai is right. Deliverance is going to come, but if it doesn't come through Esther, it's going to come from somewhere else. And there's no version of this where she is going to avoid the realities that are ahead. She's the best position to do something about it. So she better do something about it. And then she musters her courage and she sends this message back to Mordecai. And Esther sent this reply to Mordecai. I guess I just said that. That was verse 15 of Esther 4. Go gather together all the Jews who are in sousa and fast for me. Don't eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will fast as you do. And when this is done, I'll go to the king, even though it's against the law. And if I perish, I perish. Oh, I like that one. It hits hard, doesn't it? Even though I already know where the story is going and everything else. So I think when I first came across ever as when I was first thinking through this whole book, that one popped for me. So I'm like, well, what's really the pivot point of the book? And back then, I thought the pivot point of the book was the awakening of Esther that she gets in the game and she goes on this journey, this character arc toward courage and grown up priorities. And she goes from being this pretty girl who just won a pretty contest and knew how to work over a guy, which are admirable traits, I suppose she goes from that to being the queen, the bold brave queen. And I spent a whole bunch of time setting up how big, how brave and courageous this move is because it doesn't immediately seem brave to be like, well, you know, wife, go talk to your husband, but in this context, it is. And so I think I kind of fixated on that and latched onto the idea that the pivot point of the book is also the pivot point of Esther's character. But I no longer think that the book doesn't actually pivot there, even though Esther does. The book pivots, as you and I have discussed at the beginning of chapter six, after Haman has decided that he's going to go ahead and impale Mordecai on a 75 foot pole. And there's no timeframe here. There's no window for anybody to do anything about it or solve it. But the other thing that I think is that the king of the king of the king of the king could not sleep. So he ordered the books of the chronicles, the record of his reign to be brought in and read to him. It was recorded there that Mordecai had exposed big than unterish. Two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway who had conspired to kill king Xerxes. That's it. A sleepless night and happening to pick the right volume of the books of the chronicles of the reign of Xerxes to be read. That's it. Looks like happenstance. If you're reading the whole book of Esther, if you're reading the entire document on either side of the whole Bible, you pretty quickly realize, oh, that was providential. This is God at work. That's not just me reading that in from the outside as we discussed yesterday. Even the enemies of the Jews are able to read that in. Xerxes and the friends of Haman, even Haman himself, then all of the people who were going to kill the Jews are many of the people who were going to kill the Jews at the end of chapter eight. Read this into it. The original audience, the original participants looked at this stuff and they knew it wasn't just happenstance. They knew it was God turning the tables as only he could. Look, if reversal for the purposes of God's redemptive plan is one of the paramount themes of the book of Esther, and it clearly is in keeping with the promise that God made to his people as they are headed into exile, being taken away through the prophet Jeremiah. From Jeremiah 29, the one that a lot of people there for a while were getting tattooed like on their lower back and stuff, all sexy style. The one about plans to prosper you and not to harm you. The bigger context of that passage is, of course, God saying, I've not forgotten my people. You're going to go into exile. You're going to live well there. And there's a future still for you. I'm not done. And really God pays off that promise of the reversal of what seemed like the horrible outcomes for his chosen people as they're getting carried away into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians, which eventually ends up being the Persian captivity. He pays that off with a reversal that happens in Ezra, a reversal that happens in Nehemiah and a reversal that happens in Esther. Esther is the securing of that loose end that's flapping around in the wind from earlier on in the narrative through the prophet Jeremiah. And all of that payoff, all of that completion of that part of the story is a reversal. It's a turning of the tables. And all of it is by the providence of God, who is the master of history and the master of everything. And so when we get to Esther 9, 1, where we're actually dealing with the actual threat of this book, which is that the Jews are going to be completely wiped out, killed, annihilated, and destroyed. Now the tables are turned. They're not actually going to be killed, annihilated, and destroyed, not by Assyria, not by Nebuchadnezzar, not by Haman, not by, I'll just extend this out, but this is my conviction based on what I read in the Bible, not by the Romans, not by angry Western Christians in the Middle Ages, not by Hitler, not by Hamas, not by Hezbollah, and not by fashionable Western college leftists. God has promised to preserve his chosen people because he loves them and because of the role they historically play in God's redemptive plan. And so this reversal, this turning of the tables is not just an Esther theme. It's a whole Bible, all of history theme that points not to the impeccable, perfect, always right, oh, so precious character of the Jewish people. Nope, they're up and down, more down than up, even in the Old Testament. They're kind of a proxy to stand in for all of humanity. They have problems just like everybody else, but it's a testament this reversal is to the character of God and his keeping his promises, even keeping his promises when by physical natural means it looks like those promises could not be kept. So as we get toward the resolution of this plot, I look at Esther chapter nine and verse one now, and I think, no, this might be the thematic payoff of the entire book. I need a little more time to think about it from a literary perspective in terms of whether or not I actually think this is the central verse, but it's at the very least a central verse and all that theology, big picture narrative Bible stuff that we've been talking about today. Well, that I'm absolutely sure of that is in plain black and white right here on the page of this book. And we'll look at more about how that plays out next time around. All right, I'm at this is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
