    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Revelation. My friends, we've come to the end of the road. Today we're talking about the book of Revelation, and it's the last book of the Bible. And I suppose anytime you get to the last book in a series of books or the last movie in a series of movies, wonder, is the finale going to be any good? Do the people who have their hands on the wheel of this storytelling, do they understand the story they've been telling? Do they understand their own characters? Do they know what needs to happen to land the plane properly? And if you've been a consumer of media over the last 20, 30 years, you know that the answer is often no that shows don't end in satisfying ways, books don't end in satisfying ways. But here in the book of Revelation, the payoff is incredible. It rounds out a multifaceted, multi-millennial story in a way that looks to the future and pays off everything that has been set up. It pays off all the prophecies, all the narrative arcs, all of the theological arcs, all of the historical arcs, all of the injustices and the villains who didn't get it. That all gets addressed as well. It is a magnificent completion to a magnificent book. Now look, the New Testament has showed us a beautiful new paradigm, the paradigm at the age of the church. Jesus came died on the cross was resurrected. The Holy Spirit shows up and dwells within his people like God used to dwell in the temples of your. This is a new paradigm. Grace is the name of the game front and center. God's forgiveness is what makes union with God possible, but still their physical bodies and there's evil and sin and corruption and darkness and lies and injustice in the world. And we're not in the perfect paradigm yet, but at the end of Revelation, we get a look at even yet a further completion of that paradigm, one where all of the stuff that is destructive and broken, all of the consequences of the fallenness of the world and sin are resolved. Why am I telling you all of this on the front end instead of trying to summarize everything about the book of Revelation and painstaking detail? Well, because of an interpretive bias that I have about the book of Revelation. Look, there are two things that often get done with this document. Thing number one is try to solve every single image and riddle and numerical allegory that is present within the thing to try to figure out who's the Antichrist and what's the dragon? Which one of the beasts is the which beast is which horn seal trumpet? Which judgment are we on right now? What's the timeline and what's the date when Jesus is going to come back? Those are the same questions that the disciples were asking getting toward the end of the book of Matthew in the closing hours of Jesus life. They were like, well, can you just give us the timeline, please? And instead of giving them the timeline, Jesus gave them, I guess what you'd call a little preview of what is recorded in the book of Revelation. And at the end of that little preview, he gives them a bonus addendum to that talk saying that nobody knows the day or the hour except for the father. So the point being you're to live expectantly as people who know that this end game to history is unfolding and will unfolding completion to the redemptive plan will happen. But I'm not giving you the exact timeline on that. Well, it's really easy to pick up the book of Revelation with the same impulse that the disciples had, right? Like, I want to know what just went through the whole Bible. Also, I look around planet earth and I see a bunch of stupid stuff. This seems really broken and bad. Maybe it's just recency bias, but it seems like it's maybe getting broken or in batter at times. I don't know. Could be that we're headed toward some sort of resurgence of good stuff as well. But the point is, I get why they asked. I get the pressures we feel in life. I get the helplessness that we feel as we look at the world. And I understand if somebody could come to the book of Revelation and be like, I'm going to decode this thing. I'm going to crack the code. I'm going to crack the symbols and I'm going to solve it once and for all that right there. What I just described over the last couple of minutes is a theological bias. Someone could bring with them to the book of Revelation. Another theological bias someone could bring with them to the book of Revelation is to say, I want the payoff to the Bible. I accept that I'm not going to be able to solve all of the symbols. I accept that I'm not going to be able to do all of the math. And I accept and gladly forfeit my imagined right to have a timeline here and to know the day and the hour that all of these things are going to take place. But what I'm looking for is completion to this story. Even if it's broad strokes, I want to know how it wraps up. Is it good? Can I celebrate it? Is it a happy ending? Does God end up winning? The lift that the book of Revelation is doing first and foremost is to give us the big picture of how history ultimately unfolds and God's ultimate victory over the serpent Satan evil death in justice or to use the term I keep on using the culmination of God's redemptive plan. So in light of that, here's the big picture of the flow of Revelation. It's written by John. John specifically names himself as the author. And even though as a genre, Revelation is what's called an apocalypse. It kind of looks like Ezekiel and Daniel to get this wild exotic imagery about how future things are going to unfold. But in the middle of this larger apocalyptic work of literature, we also kind of get some many epistles to the churches like Paul used to write except this time around it's from Jesus himself. Now, there's seven churches that get addressed here in the early going by Jesus. And they've all been around for a while at this point. The book of Revelation is probably written pretty close to the turn of the century getting into the nineties AD right toward the end of the life of the apostle John. And the book seems very eager to get on to the apocalypse side, but it bridges the gap between the age of the church and the end of all things by speaking into the age of the church while it still exists with these opening letters. This stuff reads pretty straightforward. Jesus likes some of what he's seeing there. He doesn't like some of what he's seeing there. He offers corrections, but then when we turn the page into chapter four, visually and tonally things start to change were introduced to this very prominent character throughout the book of Revelation who is a lamb, but the lamb has been slain, which is a pretty graphic image. And clearly it's pointing to Christ, the one who John the Baptist called the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, the ultimate sacrificial lamb. But this lamb isn't dead. The lamb is alive, raised and active in the unfolding of these final events at the end of time. And what we see through the middle of the book is that there's a scroll that can't be open and there's something very, very important in there. And John is sad as he looks at it needs to be open. Well, it turns out that this lamb who was slain is the one who can open it. And there's this musical celebration about that. You're worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were slaughtered and you purchased people for God by your blood from every tribe and language and people and nation. You make them a kingdom and priests to our God and they will reign on the earth. And every time we hear words like this throughout the book of Revelation, it's part of this heavenly gathering of different characters, some of which look very foreign, some of which look like saints who are saying the praises of God and the praises of Christ and celebrating the work of the lamb. And then we get this language right after that here in chapter five, worthy is the lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise. And from here through roughly the next 10 ish chapters, we see three individual sets of judgments that are unleashed on the world and the unjust nations of the world as seven scrolls are opened as seven seals are opened and as seven trumpets are blasted by angels or maybe what we're seeing there is a repetition of the same set of seven judgments from three different angles. Either way, the result is the same. The nations are like, yeah, that's a lot and that don't get me wrong. That hurts. But we're probably not going to repent and my friends, having just gone through the whole Bible together, if you read the book of Revelation for yourself, there's going to be imagery and language here that just pops for you from other things that we've seen. For the imagery of the locus that we get from the book of Joel, that is here. Remember Ezekiel eating a scroll bizarre. Well, they have John do the same thing here in the book of Revelation. And then Zechariah and Ezekiel use the imagery of the measuring rod. This kind of stuff, it's just all over the book of Revelation. And there's too much for us to dive into meaningfully as we're having this conversation. Long story short, there are a couple of witnesses who show up and they say the things that are true and point to the authority of God, but the nations aren't into it and they get martyred, but then they're immediately resurrected. And at this point, the nations start to blink and they're like, well, maybe we should repent for some of this lifelong evil that we've been doing. This is a very important note. Throughout the book of Revelation, we're seeing two distinct evil presences who are there who need to be dealt with by God, by Christ, the conqueror. And one is the serpent, that ancient snake Satan, the devil himself. And it seems like Revelation is telling us that all the appearances of this accuser, this evil one in all his different forms throughout the Bible, they're all this same actual personal character who is in opposition to the work of God and who over a series of three encounters, God ultimately defeats by the very end of the book. And then the other evil is the nations of the world touched by sin. These ambassadors of injustice and evil and perpetrators of wickedness and oppression that all just seems to flow down river and never gets addressed. They just keep doing it. They shed blood, they spout lies, then they memory hold the lies and move on to the next exploitative lies. Even as you and I live, it seems like that's never going to get dealt with. But in Revelation, it gets dealt with. And in the same way that Peter used Babylon as a metaphor for all of the evil nations of the world. So Revelation seems to lean into that as well at times using the language of Babylon itself and other times using the language of this idolatrous, licentious woman who is representative of Babylon itself, who drinks the blood of the saints and is the embodiment of all the worldly evil that has happened ever. And as we come down to the last three or four chapters of the book, this is where the payoff to everything we've seen before really kicks in. And it's, it's amazing. It's terrifying. It's justice. And as you read it, you're both vindicated and thankful that something is finally being done. But also you can't help but immediately feel like, whoa, I don't want to get swept up in that. I want to be marked by the lamb. I want to be within the household, within the family of faith, because this judgment is terrifying. It's awe inspiring. It's the day of the Lord payoff that we had all throughout the minor prophets in the Old Testament. Babylon is defeated. The beasts that represent the evil stuff are defeated. The dragon that ancient serpent, the devil that is Satan is bound up for a thousand year reign of Christ. People debate exactly when those thousand years happened, then briefly liberated again, only to be finally crushed and defeated by God. And in the midst of all of that, the king arrives this time around, not riding on a humble donkey to a mixed reception. This time around, he shows up like a conqueror on a war horse and his words are more powerful than any weapon of war that has ever been fashioned. And it can lay waste to everything as he sees fit to bring judgment and truth as he sees fit. And after all the evil is defeated, creation is made new. And there's this new Jerusalem where God doesn't dwell in a temple in a cordoned off place where you can't go. But now the holiness and righteousness of God is on his people. And so the people enjoy true fellowship with God once again, like the Garden of Eden, but even better as God's spirit dwells among them fully, realizing the promises God made through the prophets toward the end of the Old Testament. As a series finale, you can't really ask for anything better than that. It is a beautiful completion of the story and payoff of all of the themes. I have no sense of what the actual timeline is or how it works. I'm not qualified to sort that out. And even if I were, I still think it might end up being a fool's errand, but grace and peace to everybody who wants to go and try to read this document that way and track it down. But the one thing, regardless of how anybody comes at it, that we all should be able to take from this as honest, fair-minded readers is that God's victory is absolute and complete and public. And there is no more arguing or dispute. All of the things are settled and it's beautiful and God dwells among his people. And therefore, if somebody like you or me goes through this whole Bible, even if you were a complete outsider to it at the beginning and you're like, yeah, it seems like there's a God behind that. And like it's probably the real one. And I would like to be a part of that kingdom than what revelation prompts us toward is living and thinking and prioritizing and orienting in a way that is in keeping with this vision of the future and this amazing ending to God's redemptive plan. When you visualize a book or revelation picture, the lamb who is slain, when you think about the theme, reflect on it being an overview of all of theology that points toward the end of history and the success of God's redemptive plan. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to catch chapter five in chapters 18 through 22. Okay. I got three things I want to say quickly on the way out the door as we wrap up this final episode in our series going through the Bible. One, I know a bunch of you are here because you've been around the Bible a lot. And from the get go, you were like, I do think there's a God in that God's behind the Bible. I want to know more about it. Awesome. I absolutely love that we just did this together. But I know there are a bunch of you because I've heard from you who either weren't sure or still aren't sure what to make of any of that. Maybe you just wanted to understand this better. And I have mountains of respect for you, putting in the energy and time to try to understand it for what it is as you work through your journey of life and journey of faith. I'm thrilled that you're here. I hope we get to keep having conversations together. You can't hear it, but I am tipping my hat to you as we speak. Second thing on the way out the door, I'm going to do three episodes. One big look at the Old Testament, one big look at the New Testament and then some final thoughts on this whole exercise to round out this week. And then third thing I want to tell you, we're going to start on a new series, which is on the book of Esther. And I would be so honored if you would consider joining me for it. I'm really excited about the content. It takes us into the world of Persia. It's the hyper interesting era. I think it's going to be so much fun. I'd be honored if you'd join me and maybe even consider inviting a friend. I'm excited to take a big picture. Look at everything we've done and maybe spike the football together over the next three days. We'll catch you then. And at this is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. This podcast is supported by many of you at patreon.com slash the TMBH podcast. We're grateful because it supports our family."
