This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and you've heard the expression across the Rubicon, right? There's a Jeep named after it. It's a pretty good Jeep name. If you think about it, for what Jeep's branding is, like pushing the limits, pushing the boundaries, crossing some lines. Yeah, good job Jeep. But it's a reference to something that goes way, way back to a century plus before the time of Jesus. The deal was that there's a river on the Italian peninsula, not a particularly significant one, but it's north of Rome. It's called the Rubicon River. And because of some military political dustups that had gone wrong in the late republic about a century before the time of Christ, there was an effective boundary put in place that was this little Rubicon River. And the deal was, hey, if you are coming back from campaign as a general or a politician or both and you cross the Rubicon with a legion, we know what that means and we will meet force with force. It means that your intentions are no longer disguised. You really are marching on Rome with Roman soldiers. And of course, Julius Caesar famously did that. The quote is attributed to him. The die has been cast as he crossed the Rubicon River and fairness to that guy. He was on his way back home to get executed. He had so much success in Europe and Britannia that his political rivals just viewed him as too great a threat. And so they had called him back on what would prove to be trumped up charges to probably have him dispossessed of his property and probably even executed to keep his power and his influence in check. So Caesar's play was like, I better come with an army or else we're going to have trouble. So he came with an army. At a side, all pretenses of order and niceness were dispatched with the second he crossed the Rubicon and immediately everybody starts scrambling. All bets are off. Stuff's in the crazyville and I feel like we're finally hitting the Rubicon crossing point here in Matthew 26. It's not quite the arrest that is the crossing of the Rubicon. There's some plausible deniability there. The arrest of Jesus happened in the middle of the night in Matthew 26. It was, I was some random brigands, people swords and clubs, but they were high-rears. You know, I could have been anybody who was just overly zealous. Who knows what they were doing. The trial of Jesus didn't happen in front of anybody. So there's still possible deniability there. They could maybe even make nice with Jesus if he'd given the right answer. They could be like, hey, no more that Messiah nonsense. Let's just be a little more careful with our language and they could have a wink, wink understanding like the kind of understanding that you have at a casino. If the house thinks you might be doing something that looks a little too much like cheating and then everybody just moves on and nobody knows no Rubicon's crossed, we got a deal. But after Jesus affirms that yes, he is the Christ, the Son of God and that yes, he will be seated at the right hand of God and coming on the clouds of heaven. Now we're getting tiptoes right up to the edge of the water. Maybe we're ankle deep in the water with the first troops right there. And then the high priest, Kiafis, as we've discussed, is going to bastardize a gesture that is meant to communicate profound grief, even profound grief over one's failures and shortcomings and sin as it was in the Old Testament by rending his garments. But here the cheapening of that gesture is to demonstrate just such total egregious outrage that he just simply can't move forward with these clothes any further. And that sure is actually really well crafted. Now I think the Rubicon crossing happens somewhere between verses 66 and 68 of Matthew 26. This is the point at which the toothpaste isn't going back on the tube. We're not going back on this one because they put hands on him. What do you think? Kiafis asks the room. He's worthy of death. They answered, then it turns ugly, then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him and said, prophesied us Christ, who hit you? And now the die has been cast. It's just like that parable that Jesus told them a couple chapters ago about how the owner of this vineyard sends different representatives to go and collect the rent to make sure that the tenants are tending the vineyard properly on behalf of the owner, but they rough up all of the different people he sends. So he sends his own son and they ultimately decide that they're going to rough him up all the way to the point of killing him as well. Now they are doing exactly what the bad guys in the story did. Reason is no longer in play. We're spiraling into Lord of the flies territory and the restraint that they had been showing out of fear of the people suddenly. They apparently don't feel like they need to show that restraint anymore because he said certain words and the words were too much and it was from his mouth. Now we can make fun of him and jab him and poke at him and slap him and mock him kind of like idiots do to animals in the zoo in YouTube videos right before the animals in the zoo lurched forward and do horrible things to those idiots. And then the video always gets turned off because of the graphic content regulations on YouTube except that revenge moment. Second, I'm looking. No, it never really comes in the Bible. It never really shows up here in the book of Matthew. Jesus doesn't lurch to the edge of the cage and fire back. He does not call down a legion of angels to cross the corporeal Rubicon. Instead, he just takes it like a sheep led to the slaughter, like a sheep led to the shearer, he just stands there and the king of everything, the king who was promised and long awaited, endures this abuse at the hands of people who have completely failed to hold up their end of the bargain. If they just done nothing, maybe that would have been passable. Like, you really have to do much of anything to get this one right. Like just, well, you know, maybe you're the Messiah. Maybe you're not. I need more time to think about it and then just think about it like forever for a really long time. You know, okay, whatever, you couldn't be accused of complete and total dereliction of duty, but no, like the people whose job it was to connect people with God are now actively punching and spitting on God in the flesh. When I was in elementary school, my dad would read to us every night and miss that. He didn't do it for long. It was really a short little window where dad would come down. We would sit in Mark's room, my younger brother and all three of us would cuddle right up and he would read us different books. And one of the books that I remember him reading all the way through with us and I remember the pictures and everything was The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. And I didn't know the story. I didn't know anything about it. And huh, you know, I haven't thought about that for a really long time. I cherish that. Read to your kids if you have them. You got stuff to do at night. I know things are busy. You're wanting to just shut it down for the day. But epiphany time for me. Read to your kids at night. You're not going to get to do that for very long. And I think it's very memorable and very important and very formative. Anyway, he read C.S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's Chronicles of Narnia stuff. It's the first book in the book. You figure out that there is a dad figure, a father figure, a mentor figure, a Jesus figure named Aslan. He's a lion. He talks. And he's dangerous, but he's good. And you see along the way that he has the power to defeat evil yet in some weird twisted unfolding of things that seems completely not just and backwards and weird and wrong to a kid. Well, I'm probably to an adult as well. Aslan submits to inferior beings and let them spit on him and hit him and mock him and drag him to this stone satanic table out in the pagan woods and murder him on it. And of course, this isn't an accident. Lewis is trying to make the thing that we're looking at here in the book of Matthew register in a fresh way. He's drawing the essence out of the story to illustrate it and articulate it in narrative, which is a very powerful thing. And boy, was it powerful for me? The scene of the goblins and forest monsters all just delighted and tickled with what they were accomplishing. And also the idea that maybe any of them could have bounced the other way. But once that first shot was fired, once that first drop of blood was spilled, once that first pop across the muzzle happened to Aslan. Everybody's just in in gleeful Lord of the flies style delight. And all of a sudden everybody wants to get in their metaphorical one stab of the knife to demonstrate that they did their part to put this thing down in Matthew 26. The dyes cast the Rubicon is crossed the exact violent vile opposed to the things of God opposed to the prophets opposed to the redemptive plan behavior that Jesus was calling out a few chapters earlier in absolutely specific terms is now on display here. They are exactly who we thought they were. And while surely there were lots of Jewish people at this time who saw Jesus for who he was the Messiah, the religious leaders didn't just passively blow it. They are actively blowing it, savagely standing in opposition to the redemptive things of God. And it is a sobering scene. The hero of the story is bloodied and he is on his way to an unjust execution. More about that next time around. A Matt is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
