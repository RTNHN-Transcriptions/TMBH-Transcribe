I know there are a ton of you who are listening to these conversations and participating who would say, yeah, I just, I don't think there's a God, but I'm really interested in the Bible. I also know there are a ton of you like me who strongly believe that all of this came from somewhere in that the God of the Bible is the God who is still sustaining all things. So just acknowledging that we are a diverse bunch and we've decided that we're just going to hang out together. We're going to see things different. We're going to process big important ideas together. That's just who we're going to be. That's how we're going to think all of that stuff acknowledged. Let me throw out this question. At what point is it okay to passively disrespect a political leader, an elected official, a nobleman of the court, a president, a king, etc. And I do think this is a different question than at what point is okay to actively disrespect someone, like, run up and give them the double finger, double fingers, double finger. Get your, take that. What do I do to of them? Like that's, you know, that's a little bit more assertive. We're seeing more of that in our political discourse at this point. That's another conversation, but let's just go with passive disrespect. Like there's something that I'm supposed to do that shows respect for your organization or your bureaucratic post or whatever. And I'm just not going to do it. I'm just going to stand here and refrain from showing that gesture of respect. And we all know what that means. Now I'm sure there are some of you who are like, well, I mean, some politicians and bureaucrats and government leaders, they do really bad stuff, but give to Caesar. What is Caesar's? If you owe somebody respect, give them respect, if honor, then give them honor. There's nobody who's been put in a position of authority, except for by God's will and providence. And you look at that and you're like, eh, if the protocol demands the stand up or salute or spin around or make gesture or whatever to show honor to someone in some sort of leadership position in a government, then you would better do it. I'm guessing there are others of you who are like, seriously, you're just talking about not doing some sort of gesture of respect and just letting it pass by, like not cheering when you're told to cheer or not saluting when you're told to salute or not putting your hand over your heart when you're all supposed to put your hand over your heart. Oh, well, huh. Yeah, whatever. Just don't do it if you want to not do it. Go ahead and put a pin in that question, that debate for just a second. And let's look at Esther chapter five and the way the story is unfolding. We're going to run into a scenario here that takes us right back to that conundrum, that behavioral question for Mordecai, the Jew, once again in this story. You get the drill, Esther went to the king. She's received the king's like, what do you want? Half the kingdom. I mean, it's great to see a lovely to have you here. And she's like, I just wanted to have a banquet with you. That's all I want. And he's like, great, super. Let's do it. And Haman. Great. Let's have Haman go. Everybody's super happy about it. They go right over to the banquet. The king's like, all right, same question. Up to half the kingdom. What do you want? What's going on here? And the queen sizes it up. It's like, for some reason, this either was my original plan not to do it right now, or this thing was always designed to be a read option. And I can see the linebacker sniffing this out. Yeah, we're just going to go a board, a board, a board. I'm going to choose the second banquet option. And that's going to be my answer to the king. We're going to do a second banquet. I just wanted to have one more banquet. And then I'll tell you. And the king's like, oh, goody. This is great. Let's do a second banquet. And Haman is on cloud nine. I mean, he's got some stuff on his plate. He's got a massacre, an entire race of people and elevate his own authority. But who doesn't like getting invited to the fanciest banquets and the most important stuff? So he's just thrilled about all of this, thrilled that he gets to go to another one of these. And he cannot wait to get home and act all dignified until he gets there and then shut the door. And have his wife be like, well, what happened to be like, it was the best thing ever. I got invited to the thing. And there's going to be another thing. And guess who got invited to that to this guy? And then they're going to pump their fists and stop their feet because they're so excited about how things are going. And they'll open the door and they'll be all dignified again. That's what Haman has ahead of him for the evening. So he's leaving there in just the best of spirits. And then in fact, that's what the passage says, Esther chapter five. But there's going to be a fly in the ointment. Here's how it goes. Esther five nine, Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai, the king's gate and observed that he neither rose, nor showed fear in his presence. He was filled with rage against Mordecai. Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. Okay. First of all, let's give props where props are due. Good job, Haman. You kept it together. You had the good social sense to know that you're going to look like a fool. You're the lion in this equation. And you don't want to be roaring at a mouse and worrying about its opinions in front of other people. That will weaken the position of the king. It'll weaken your office. You can't stoop to that level, even though you're in the middle of an 11 month long massive stoop, where because of a personal slight, you're going to commit genocide and eliminate an entire people group from the face of the earth. But it's different because you did the paperwork on that one. And because the paperwork was there, it's politics. Like you, there's only some ad you can. I mean, it's just, it's not even immoral. It's just a bill that got passed. I mean, it's just, it's different somehow or at least I guess that's how we're expected to think. So good job, Heyman, not melting down, but Mordecai. Dang, this guy's not going to be budged. He's not coming around. He's not going to grovel in front of Heyman to try to get Heyman to change his mind. And it's amazing how much just one guy not standing up and falling all over himself about how great Heyman is, is enough to wreck this day. Are you kidding me? You got invited to the Queen's banquet. You got invited to another Queen's banquet. This is a great day. But that guy, he wouldn't stand up. That's how he was being. He just sat there the whole time. Everybody else stood up and he wouldn't do it. It makes me so mad. It really is a comically impotent moment for Heyman in that regard. But it also kind of flips the equation a little bit power wise here, doesn't it? I mean, who really is the lion and who really is the mouse here? If Mordecai, not even by actively doing something simply by doing nothing. Just not doing anything. If he can instill in Heyman such rage, rage that ultimately is going to lead to some poor reactionary decision making on his part that is going to play a role. Again, I'd say providentially in the whole unfolding of this story toward good ends. But let's go back to that question. We were talking about the beginning with Mordecai. We don't know in what's that. It's got to be the beginning of three here. Yeah, the beginning of three. We don't know why Mordecai wouldn't acknowledge Heyman when he came by in the first place, set all of these events in motion theories about it. Some people just assume it's because somehow Mordecai is religiously pious. There's really nothing in the text to indicate that. I kind of wonder if maybe Mordecai was upset that he got passed over for a promotion that really should have been his. He saved the king's life. I mean, if that's the case, dude has a point. And then instead the promotion goes to this enemy of the Jews. Maybe that's it. Maybe it's just a personal beef. We can speculate all we want, but the text, the author of the book just doesn't give us what we need in chapter three to say, here's why Mordecai wouldn't rise. But by the time we get to chapter five, I think we've got a pretty good idea why Mordecai isn't rising. It's because of the whole genocide thing. And different people are going to respond to this kind of a slight. That's the understatement of the entire history of the podcast in different ways. In the movie Whiplash with J.K. Simmons and a young Miles Teller, I think that's the story that introduced Miles Teller. Miles Teller's dad is played by Paul Reiser from Mad About You and three minute note, no, no, no, no, that's Ted Danson. My two dads, which if that came out now, it would probably deal with very different issues. But it was a sitcom in the 80s and Paul Reiser was a pretty big deal, but he plays with the dad in this movie Whiplash. And we learn a lot about him early on when he's sitting with his son, Miles Teller, in a theater. And somebody just rudely comes through and sticks their butt in their face, just cramming down the road, knocks over their popcorn and stuff. And Paul Reiser is a very passive man. And he apologizes to the person who knocks over their popcorn and is rude to them. And this is held out as a movie goes along as being very in contrast to the guy who works at the musical conservatory played by J.K. Simmons. And that's a good show. If you haven't seen it, I actually do recommend it. I don't remember if it's bad. I don't know. You know what to do in C-Internet. You can figure it out. So you got that kind of approach to enduring a massive slight or a minor slight. And then the other approach I saw play out recently with Emily Blunt's character in Oppenheimer, who is disgusted that another character is willing to accept massive indignities, character assassination even, and then is willing to shake the hand of the person who did it. And when the time comes for her to have the opportunity to shake this person's hand, she's like, no. And she looks right at him and withholds the handshake. Well, which you think is the better idea is probably going to a little bit depend on your wiring. And I have to acknowledge those biases when I look at a passage like this and I'm like, dang straight Mordecai. Sit on your butt and do nothing. Because simply by doing nothing, you expose what a clown, sham, power grab, megalomaniacal gesture of evil. This is on the part of that insecure coward just because he gets fancy outfits. And just because everybody's supposed to say he's so important and so good, because the proper paperwork was filled out and he was given a position that is made out of more proper paperwork, doesn't change anything about the fact that he is fixing to be a mass murderer, a genocidal maniac. And throughout history, we haven't always known what to do with people who commit massive human rights abuses, but fill out the requisite paperwork on the part of the state. Stuff has to really rise to the level of shock and horror for the citizenry to come together and rise up and be like, nah, we're going to have Nuremberg trials over that. Usually the political will does not exist to take that kind of an active step to say, okay, if you are a private citizen, obviously we would all pile on you, but it messes with our moral compass when the government does it and they fill out the requisite paperwork. And that's what's happened here. For me and the way I'm wired, I absolutely love this scene. I love this passive aggressive resistance where it's not even like Mordecai needs to jump up and tell him off and give him the speech, do better, Senator. Nope, we can just not do anything, because it's time for everybody to stand up and do their little performative thing, to demonstrate that they affirm that this reality is good and noble, and it is ordained, and it is from the king, and this is how things are. But this reality is evil. I don't care how carefully you filled out the paperwork. I don't care how official your government is. Somebody is fixing to kill an entire race. That is bad. And I think it would speak to the weakness of Mordecai if he leapt right up. I was like, thank you for genociding us, sir. Nah, just on a deeply personal level. This is probably my favorite Mordecai moment so far. He exposes just how absolutely frail and fragile this seemingly immovable monolith of the order of the man who best the signet ring of the king. He exposes how weak this whole thing is. All it takes is me not standing and playing along with your silly game. And you lose your mind because you know that I know what you know. And that is that this is all a performative frail joke. And if we don't play along, it becomes pretty evident to everybody that you don't actually have the kind of power that you hold yourself out as having. I think you and I can still get along great if you look at this scenario and you're like, nah, that wasn't shrewd. It might have felt good for Mordecai, but he probably should have just stood up and saluted the dude and not agitated him any further. And you could have a point. Maybe that would have been the shrewd thing to do. I also like that at some point, dude just said, now, whichever way you view it, we're going to see the same thing in the coming verses. And that is that Mordecai's refusal to acknowledge Haman, which agitates him, motivates Haman towards certain decisions and actions that are going to play a major role in the good resolution of this very difficult situation. And we will look at more of that next time around. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
