This is the 10 Minute Bival hour podcast and I just watched a couple of clips from Weird Owls UHF, which is possibly the greatest film in the history of films. You've not seen that movie before. You are missing out and you should probably go watch it. It is maybe the movie I've watched more than any other movie in my whole life, but there is this scene in there where the bad guy of the story, RJ Fletcher, he's the owner of the big important TV station, the network affiliate in town. RJ Fletcher is in this scene informed that Weird Owls and his TV station, a UHF channel, U62, he's been informed that the UHF channel is cutting into his ratings, is cutting into his market share and he flips out on all of his middle management and points to a painting of his father who started the important TV station on the wall and he says, this is an embarrassment, a disgrace. What do you think RJ Fletcher senior would be saying if he were alive today? And then one of the middle management people is like, help me out of this box. I can't breathe in here. Help me out. Which is not that funny, but it totally works on me probably because I saw this when I was 10 and that was funny back then, but there is a point, my friends. There's always a point, I promise. The point is that RJ Fletcher is invoking the old thing where you point to somebody who is now dead and gone, who figured something out and who had some standards and then you point to what's going on right now and you're like, hey, what do you think they would say if they were here today? Donald Reagan is rolling over in his grave right now. Well, our forefathers would be, you know, the trick and sometimes it's invoked and maybe accurately, probably usually it's invoked in a way that's pretty nonsensical as a rhetorical flourish. And the weakness, obviously, of this rhetorical technique is that RJ Fletcher couldn't actually possibly know what RJ Fletcher senior would be thinking about the state of the cross town TV rivalry in Weird Al's UHF. You can't possibly know for sure what George Washington and Alexander Hamilton would think about what's going on today. It's ultimately speculative and kind of a red herring because it draws you off into another debate about another thing. But as we've discussed before around here, what if you actually did know for sure exactly what those people of the past would think about what is unfolding right now? Well, if say you were like, God in the flesh and you knew all the things, then if you speculated about what someone from the past thought about current situations or circumstances, your speculation would not be speculation. It would just be a statement of fact. So when Jesus employs the, what would these dead people think about what's going on now technique, he is a little bit more credible with it because theoretically he actually knows. And that is what we get here in Matthew chapter 12. Matthew 12 has been hyper interesting to work through. You've got two Sabbath controversies between Jesus and the religious leaders. The religious leaders don't like the way that plays out for them. So they decide they're going to murder Jesus. Jesus strategically withdraws. People follow him to where he withdraws to and bring a demon possessed guy to him and Jesus heals that guy. And then he's better and the people are like, maybe you're the Messiah. The Pharisees are like, maybe you're in league with Satan. Jesus shoots that down. And then the Pharisees try to save a little face by being like, Oh, okay, maybe just one more miraculous sign. Could you do one of those? And then Jesus is like a wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. And now we're on the trail of clues and we're trying to unravel this riddle. What does Jonah have to do with Jesus? And then in verse 40, Jesus goes on for his Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish. So the son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. And yesterday we broke down all of the parallels or lots of the parallels. And that all is a bit presumptuous now, isn't it? Lots of the parallels between what's going on in the story of Jonah in comparison to the story of Jesus and I guess in contrast to the story of Jesus as well. So we did the work. We tracked down the clues. We have a much better sense of how those two things align and how whatever is going to happen in the unfolding of Jesus life is going to be a sign that gives us a sense of the character of God who he is, what he's up to and what he's into. And then in verse 41, we get into some new stuff. Jesus goes on to say, the men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And now one greater than Jonah is at hand. Okay, you'll recall Nineveh was the great Assyrian city that was wicked and violent and horrible and just picture all the things that maybe you don't like about society that you think need to change and then just throw an exponential on the end of that. And that's what Nineveh was like. It was a dumpster fire and God tells Jonah who's a prophet and he's in this business that you got to go to Nineveh and Jonah's like, yeah, but I go in the exact opposite direction. I'm not doing that. And ultimately God steers Jonah to Nineveh whether he likes it or not. And it reluctantly goes and does what he's supposed to do. But it's in the Nineveh is being like, yeah, forget you. I don't care very stupid God or any of that stuff. They're like, whoa, super sorry. We're very, very sorry. We're going to stop this all. And they repent and ash and sack cloth. And then God's like, cool, we're good here. And then Jonah is very mad that Nineveh ends up being spared and God has to sort that out. It turns out that the whole thing was much less about Nineveh and much more about the character of Jonah. Interesting. So Nineveh is a very important character in the story of Jonah and it illustrates how sometimes people and things that look utterly unredeemable are redeemable by God that God sometimes chooses to do something in the collective minds or hearts of the people or an individual and fix something that looks like it could never possibly be fixed. And that can be a pretty amazing thing. There's some parallels between Jonah's negative reaction to that and the very famous parable of the prodigal son and the older brother over in Luke who doesn't like that the younger brother who screwed everything up ends up repenting and coming home and is received by the father. So those themes are in play, but Nineveh, again, that's a Gentile city that seems to be getting things right that the religious leaders who are Jewish and therefore the chosen people of God are not getting right. So when Jesus says the people of Nineveh are going to stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, that's pretty loaded on a couple levels. One, that's pretty damning because these Gentiles and the Jews aren't getting it right in this equation. Jonah didn't get right in this equation, but two is pretty damning at the moment as well because Jesus is saying that the Pharisees are making the same mistake that Jonah made in not getting it, not understanding the heart of God, even resenting the heart of God, even obstructing the redemptive work of God for outsiders until they're absolutely dragged by the ear into participating in the thing. Jonah does not come out of the book named after him getting any credit. All the credit clearly goes to God, and if there's any hint of secondary credit, I guess it would be to the king of Nineveh who was like, whoa, what have we done? We've got to fix this thing and turn things around. So again, rather than offering one set of comparisons, Jesus offers two sets of comparisons to drive the point home even further, verse 42, the queen of the south will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here. This is the queen of Sheba who famously interacted with Solomon in First Kings 8, 9, 10, somewhere in there, and that in and of itself is a pretty interesting story because it looks like she and Solomon hit it off, if you will, and there's this whole other branch of the history of the religion associated with the Jewish people and eventually Jesus that comes out of that particular visit story for another day. But she was there in part because the wisdom of Solomon was breathtaking. So that's pretty easy to see what's going on here. Jesus is making these back-to-back comparisons, saying the men of Nineveh responded to Jonah's preaching. Are you kidding me? That wasn't even a good, even want to be there. And now one who is way better at preaching and communicating is here. So if they could repent with that crappy job that Jonah did, how much more so would Nineveh repent at what's going on right in front of your faces, but you guys aren't repenting. And the queen of Sheba, the queen of the south, she knew wisdom when she saw it. She was willing to make a giant overland trip in order to be in closer proximity to that wisdom. But someone wiser than Solomon is here right now saying wise things in front of you that are maximum wise. And y'all are like, well, the proof that you're not Lucifer or in league with Lucifer could just do another one of your tricks for us. And so where RJ Fletcher of Weird Al UHF fame failed to properly invoke the here's what these dead people would be thinking if they were alive today, rhetorical technique. Jesus on the other hand nails it because he has precise knowledge of what these people would be thinking if they were alive today. And further, once again, Jesus has pulled this off in back to back chapters at the end of chapter 11 after Jesus condemns this generation, the zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, the way people were thinking about truth and about God in verses 20 through 24, where he says, woe to you, Corazine, woe to you, Beth, say, to have the miracles that were proclaimed in you had been proclaimed entire inside on they would have repented long ago in sack cloth and ashes. But I tell you, it'll be more bearable for tire inside on in the day of judgment than for you and you Capernaum. We'll be lifted up to the skies. No, you'll go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you, it'll be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. So Jesus says all of that stuff condemning the spirit and the mindset of people who should have been quick to receive him back there in chapter 11. But that is directed at a general audience, a general mentality of the day in chapter 12, that same invocation of here's what the deal would be with these people. If they had seen what you'd seen or here's what they did when they did see it, here the invocation of that technique in chapter 12 is specifically targeted at the Pharisees, not just people in general who don't get it. And again, you will note that Jesus is hitting them where it hurts by pointing to two examples of Gentiles who are welcomed into the kingdom for recognizing the true work of God when they saw it as opposed to the religious leaders of the chosen people who can't seem to understand who it is is working and teaching and doing this miraculous stuff right in front of their faces. Look, last thought here, I am not saying I would have got this right if I had been there. Sometimes it's really easy to sound like I'm taking a tone here of like, ha ha, idiots, everybody else is dumb. I totally would have been for Jesus because I'm smart. I know how the things are. I probably wouldn't have. I don't know about you. Maybe you're wired differently than me, but I probably would have been on team wrong here. The tone that I'm taking, I hope is one that's just kind of fun as we buzz through the thing and look at it for what it is. But if in any way that tone sounds like I know how all the things are and I'm better than the people that are being criticized in this passage, then I'm saying it wrong and I would appreciate it if you'd give me the benefit of the doubt on that. But finally, if you haven't seen Weird Al's UHF, it might be time. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
