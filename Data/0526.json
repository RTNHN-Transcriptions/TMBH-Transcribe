This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. And I really like to open these things with some kind of fun uplifting example where it's like, ah, ha, ha, ha, I remember that thing. Oh, yeah, I can relate to that. That's great. But that gets really difficult when you're dealing with a passage like, well, we're dealing with right now in Matthew chapter 23, where it's just a pronouncement of seven condemnations against an establishment, against a group of people that nobody in the circle, nobody in the room is going to walk away unscathed because the one person in the room who has the credibility to be like, you know what? This right here, this clown show. And just so that you don't think I'm making general sweeping observations, I'm going to go bit by bit through each element of the clown show. And I'm going to point a very specific targeted finger at each and every clown contributing to the clown show so that everybody knows exactly what it is that's going on here. And if you all choose to continue to participate in the clown show, it's going to be with eyes wide open and everybody knowing that now the thing has been said. And so it's really hard to come up with like a super fun, happy example that gets us into that. So let me just do this. I want you to go to a dark place with me for just a minute and picture the last time you were a part of a clown show. And by that, I mean, it worked family circle of friends, maybe a weird church thing, religious thing, institution, social group, sports thing. I don't know. Like some sort of circle of social brokenness that you were a part of. Maybe it was your fault a little bit. Maybe you were just the horrified bystander who took the whole thing in and couldn't believe what you were seeing. Either way, just for a second, go back to that place and think about all of the moving parts that you gradually came to recognize. And all of the multifaceted dysfunction on small levels that added up to massive dysfunction at the highest level, but also that thing that you were a part of that I was a part of. Like nobody could point at the emperor and be like, they got no clothes. You all see how screwed up this is. Nobody would do that because you're risk losing everything because if anybody even starts to pick at how screwed up the thing is, the whole thing is going to break it. But sometimes you get this circle of symbiotic dysfunction where it's like the Simpsons episode with Mr. Burns where he had all the diseases at once, but they were all like wedged in there together so tight that if they fixed any of the diseases, all of the other diseases would break loose and kill him. So the doctors decided the best thing medically to do in his case was for him to just have all the diseases at once and never deal with anything. These kinds of Mr. Burns have all the diseases at once dysfunctional dumpster fires can happen. And probably most of us have at least one taste of that in the rearview mirror. And in the book of Matthew, going into this next chunk that we're going to be looking at over the next several days, we've been watching this dumpster fire materialize. We've been watching the dysfunction manifest before our eyes of what is going on with the religious leadership at the time of Jesus. And after looking at 22 and a half chapters of this together, I think one of the things we can probably admit is that there was surely a lot of sincerity on the part of each individual Pharisee, Sadducee, religious leader, maybe even Herodian. They all wanted the good of the people, the good of the nation, probably they all wanted to genuinely serve God and bring people to a place where they were serving God. But as Jesus has been pointing out in the first, whatever it is, the first 12 verses of chapter 23, this dysfunction, whether it's intentional or not, this hypocrisy, whether it's intentional or not, is so poisonous and toxic and awful and evident to anyone honest that at some point, even if it costs somebody everything, someone just has to step up and say what the thing is. So why not have it be the one who speaks with authority and not as the teachers of the law? Jesus himself is going to be the one who says the thing that is going to get him killed. And if you've ever been a part of something over the top dysfunctional, you know that at least metaphorically, socially, if you were to step forward and say, here's everything that's wrong with us and everything it would take to change it. I know everyone can hide behind their supposed good motives. But what we've made together is a complete poisonous disaster. If you were to do that, you would at minimum be socially killed through exile and social punishment in that circle. And as far as the tendrils of that circle of people reached out into the larger community, Jesus is going to make a value judgment here moving forward from verse 13 of Matthew chapter 23. And that value judgment says, I understand fully what this is going to do to me socially. I understand fully that this is going to turn the goodwill of experience so far against me. I understand fully that the people I'm about to call out for what they have built together, even though they might have built it with the best of intentions. I understand fully who they are connected with politically. And I understand fully that those powerful people with whom these religious leaders are connected have the ability and willingness to put me to death. But somebody has got to say something even if it's costly because this is the truth and the consequences of it are ruinous. What we are going to see moving forward from verse 13, almost to the end of the chapter of 23 is Jesus move from a general accusation of hypocrisy that we've been looking at for the last 12 verses in front of everybody to a very specific pronouncement of seven woes. Hey, this circle of disaster that has been made here is most manifest in these seven awful broken practices and sets of motivation. And one at a time we are going to shine a light on each of them, even though it is going to be very costly. I think as you and I work through these pronouncements of woe, these seven woes moving forward to Matthew chapter 23, it's going to make sense in the back of our minds for us to remember the beatitudes. There's another list that Jesus went through and those are blessed ours. These are woe to use. And I think we will see that even though they might not organize up in exactly the same order, still the structure is very comparable and the point is very comparable on the one hand bless it or you when kingdom values, this is the real true stuff. The stuff everybody wants the stuff that when you look at it and you see it, you just can't argue. That's beautiful. That's right. Versus over here on the other hand, you got the woe to you stuff that is the opposite of kingdom value stuff. The fruit of kingdom values, beautiful. The fruit of woe to you opposite of kingdom values are rotten. And the only reason that people don't go and do kingdom values is because it costs you something and the only reason that people go along with not kingdom values, dumpster fire, gross toxic culture of values is because the pushback on them would cost you something and to go along with them gains you something. But as we've seen and as I hope we are appreciating more and more all the time throughout this document as we understand the social setting better and as we put ourselves in these shoes, Jesus is weird, bro. Jesus is doing strange stuff, sister. He does not have the same motivations as your Facebook friends. He's not playing the same game on Twitter or Reddit that you are playing. He's not playing the same office politics that you're playing that has served you well, but that you kind of feel conflicted and gross about a little bit. He's not doing the same maneuvers that you're doing for the greater good of society with the questionable angles that we all often feel like we have to take to make sure that actual bad overt evil things won't happen. We are compromised. All of us, especially me and I say that with confidence because I know me best and I know how compromised I am. We are all all humans compromised except Jesus. And that's the thing that stands out as being so weird about this story. If you write any other story where you have a character who is this good and this other they can't help it come off as weird and unrelatable and Mary Soush, I go, yeah, all their motives are good. Everything's good except in this case, he is that good, which means he's the only one positioned the right way, the only one with the moral clarity, the only one with the courage, the only one with the ability to truly call out this brokenness and not get mired down in. Well, yeah, but you that one time remember or get mired down in, well, I know everybody means well. And so we're just going to have to move ahead with some really destructive things that we all know are fruitless and dumb and bad because Donnie and Carol and Mike, they all mean so well and they would never intentionally do these destructive things. And if we stop doing these destructive things, they would feel bad or criticized. And so we shouldn't do that. Who are we? And I get all of that rationale when we find ourselves in one of these situations. Jesus, however, is other. He is different. He's playing another game. And as we work through these roughly next 26 verses together that are the inflection point, the pivot point between him being able to walk away from this with everybody thinking he was super and just go back out into Galilee. And that was a nice experience and him being killed for words and who he holds himself out as being that otherness is going to be on display. So I want to try to keep the profundity of what we're about to encounter in the back of our minds and not just see this as like another online meltdown or a Twitter rant or an I quit and I'm telling everybody off kind of thing. This might look a little bit like this at first blush, but there's something much more complex singular and unique going on and we'll actually start digging into these seven woes next time around. Last thought, big picture here. If going to those places that just ask you to go that is remembering the really gross, really ugly stuff that maybe you participated in, maybe you were victimized by maybe a little bit of both. If that felt gross and wasn't fun to revisit and you really don't enjoy going back there, then I just want to say I'm super glad you're doing this Matthew thing with me because the sum of this story that we're looking at in the book of Matthew is resolution to that darkness and that grossness and that lack of forgiveness and it that you feel about those worst things we go through in life. The whole sum of all of this is that there is redemption, there is forgiveness, there is a rightness and a righteousness and a right standing. There is an atonement apart from our own ability to atone and these difficult passages we're looking at are according to the text, all part of the expensive, painful process of Jesus unmaking or redistributing to himself the consequences of all of those darkest things that touch us all and replacing it with his kingdom values and a new family of faith and a title not as one who was part of a gross awful thing you should feel guilty about forever, but instead as honored son, daughter, heir, agent, citizen of the kingdom. So even the parts of this text that cause us to go to the dark places and remember dark things should also come with the silver lining of encouragement that all of it is pointing toward some kind of redemption in the end that the text holds out as being for the readers of this text, including you and me, even a couple thousand years after the fact.
