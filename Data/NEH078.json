I didn't know that was a thing. I don't actually, I still don't know if it's a thing, but I named it that. It's a productivity journal. And I got this leather book. It was a gift from somebody for Christmas. Really very fancy. That's what gave me the idea in the first place. Like, I need to use this book. It's so cool looking. As blank throughout doesn't have dates or anything, but what I started doing is I write down the date in a very simple form and then the day of the week that that was. And then I only give myself so many words to write down the raw factual details of what actually happened that day. I don't really talk much about my feelings or anything like that. There's no narrative or story to it. It's just this is what happened today. Phone calls, interactions, work that I got done. It's been really fruitful. And one of the reasons it's been very fruitful for me is because it's sustainable. I use such an economy of words here that I'm not overwhelmed by it at the end of the day. It's really easy for me to sit down and do my little doogie-hauser journaling thing at the end of the day. Because I don't have to say anything profound like doogie-hauser had to. I just have to write down the facts of what I did that day. So that's one reason I like it. It's simple. Second reason I like it is because if I'm getting a lot of stuff done, sometimes I will have this proclivity to feel like it wasn't enough. I could have done more, not taken enough ground. And then I feel bad at the end of a productive day, mostly because I just haven't reflected carefully on what the day was. Well, the productivity journal forces me to reflect. The other thing that I like about it though is that it has illustrated to me how easy it is for life and memories and recollection to go downstream. It feels like I remember everything from this last week, but I don't. And here's how I know. If I wait two days or even three days to fill in my low productivity journal because I just forget or something, it's really hard to fill in yesterday's events with the usual level of accuracy that I've come to expect in doing this. And if I go back two days, it's way harder. I have to start going into my text messages and using documentation to try to cobble it back together. I have a pretty good memory, I think, but that's just how fast recollection goes downstream. Well, here's the point. In the book of Nehemiah, there is a theme that is very subtle. And now I've got it all teed up and everything for you. So you can guess where this is going. But if before the last three minutes, I've been like, all right, what's the theme of Nehemiah? And you said to yell it and you're sweaty, disgusting, unitard while you're there working out in the morning, listening to this podcast, what would you have shrieked? You probably would have shrieked something about building the walls or the travel and the sword. And I think those would be very good knowing where you fit in the big story, the narrative, the planned leadership, maybe something like that. But I think one of the subtle way underrated themes of Nehemiah that I mean, even I haven't really talked about it that much is this idea of remembrance. You remember how Nehemiah 5 ends? It's all this stuff about how Nehemiah is feeling internally and how he's handled his business and he hasn't taken anything for himself. And now he's been generous with all the things that theoretically have been heaped upon him financially. What does he say at Nehemiah 519? Remember me with favor. Oh my God, for all I have done for these people. We're not quite there yet, but getting toward the end of chapter six, we get the same refrain, but directed the other way. Remember, Tobiah and Sanbalat. Oh my God, because of what they have done. Remember also the prophetess, Noah, Diah and the rest of the prophets who've been trying to intimidate me. And we're going to get more of this remembrance stuff as we go forward. In fact, it ends on a note of remember, remember, remember, remember me. Why is everybody getting so mad when other people come in? They're like, we're a part of your thing. Well, because you're trying to mess with the memory. You're trying to muck around with it and make it all murky and sloppy when we know who the descendants of this promise are. But admittedly, that's a different time, a different era that we're looking at there. Our concerns are going to be very different today, but it was very important to Ezra and Nehemiah to retain memory, to give this clear and ordered account of who did what, who demonstrated courage, who demonstrated cowardice. What is chapter three all about in Nehemiah? If not, remember, it's, you remember Nehemiah three, remember that one was? That's one where we just get the build montage and we sort of powered through the whole thing in like two episodes. Because what more is there to do with it other than remember that this guy who had this job rebuilt this part of the wall and Steve and Cheryl rebuilt the dungate and all of the other stuff. What the text is going for there is a public proclamation of these people's contributions when it cost them something so that it will be remembered. And in chapter six, what we've been seeing so far is the enemies of Nehemiah are goofing around with memory. They're playing games with it to try to get ahead. Nehemiah is trying to stand by the facts, keep a productivity journal, be like, this is exactly what happened and who did what? This is what I did here. And he's content to just say, you know, justice is mine. Say at the Lord, vengeance is mine. Say at the Lord, God, you remember this, you sort all of this stuff out. His enemies are playing a very different game. So they come four times and discreetly try to get Nehemiah to come out and presumably they're killing him or into some kind of goofy compromise. We've read it when I was reading Yang's is interesting. And the word came to Sanbalot to buy a gash on the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it. Though up to that time, I'd not set the doors in the gates. Sanbalot and gash them sent me this message. Come, let's meet together in one of the villages on the plane of Ono, but they were scheming to harm me. So I sent messages to them with this reply. I'm carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to go down to you? Four times they sent me the same message and each time I gave them the same answer. They're doing sneaky, not rememberable things. He's doing public, rememberable things. A hundred years after the fact, nobody's going to know exactly what was said behind closed doors. They're only going to see the outcome and the big public actions. Nehemiah is doing everything in the light, all of it. His enemies are doing everything in the shadows. Nehemiah has demonstrated a continual resistance to get into the narrative game. Well, they said this and they said that and that's why I had to do this and they made this. He understands that all that will be recorded is the kind of stuff that you and I see when I get out this big giant thick book I got here in my right hand called The Histories by Herodotus. He was familiar with how the histories were written. He's familiar with the books of the Bible that are in the Bible and the supporting documented books that get referenced throughout the Old Testament that weren't in the Bible. He's a learned man and he's also no doubt familiar with the Greek historians who were writing before. Probably he was familiar with Herodotus who was a contemporary of Nehemiah. He was familiar with how history in Persia and Greece and in the Jewish tradition works and he understands that they use an economy of words like I do in my productivity journal to just say this is the stuff that happened. Then so and so rebuilt this part of the wall. And so and so came with 20,000 troops and attacked so and so and sacked the city. That's it. You don't get to know most of the time what everybody was thinking and who said what and what the little scuttle butt in the gossip was Nehemiah is very smart given that he's doing a great work, a historic thing to stay above the fray. How many times have you and I got suckered into, roped into, duped into, doing things that look really bad and stupid from a big 10,000 foot view. But in the muck and mud of the gossip and the scuttle butt and the buzz and the taking of sides seemed very defensible. If you can just give me four hours to explain it at Applebee's over about 80 ounces of margaritas. Nehemiah is smarter than me. Nehemiah is wiser than me. He's not getting suckered into those traps as I have been suckered into and maybe I've done some sucker in myself. He's a guy with this remarkable perspective and it keeps him from getting fooled by stuff like this. Four times they send the message trying to mess with the memory, the recollection of how this story will be recalled, how it's to be thought of at the time. Now they try to go public with their messing with the recollection as we discussed yesterday. Then the fifth time, Sanbalat sent his aid to me with the same message and in his hand was an unsealed letter in which was written. It's different. Now it's public. Sanbalat's aid, people know who that is, is not going to travel unaccompanied. There's going to be colors, markings, whatever it indicate. This is a message from the enemies. He's coming into our work camp. Maybe there are no swords here, but here ye, here ye, I bring ye this message as a legate of the great Sanbalat and this is what it shall read. Sealed note out with his noble seal. It is reported among the nations and Gesham says it's true that you, Nehemiah and the Jews are plotting to revolt. Therefore you're building the wall more over. According to these reports, you're about to become their king and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem. There's a king in Jerusalem. Now this report will get back to the king. So come, let us confer together. You see, people were going to get to hear the content of that letter. It's now out there that this accusation has been made and in a way implicitly what's going on here is that the bad guys are like, hey, we tried to do this the nice way, the easy way, the discreet way, but you wouldn't have it. And so now we're going to have to officialize this with some paperwork and some official heralds. And now what could have been quiet is known about you that there's some rumors people are saying, I mean, rumors a lot of times have truth to them whether smoke there's fire. People are saying that you're actually a rebel. You're no friend of the king at all and that you've even cooked up some fake prophets to declare some things about you and enter into a state of revolt. We wanted to help. We wanted to talk, but you were unwilling to meet us. So we had to in the interest of what is right and defying the temptation to lie the most hated of activities in a key maned Persia and to defend the honor of the king and the sovereignty of his kingdom. We had to file this paperwork and send it to you. I sent them this reply. Something like what you're saying is happening. You're just making it up out of your head. They were all trying to frighten us thinking their hands will get too weak for the work and it'll not be completed, but I prayed now, strengthen my hands. If you're not sure who the good guy or the bad guy is in a given situation, just look at who weasels all the time. Usually the weasels are going to be the bad guy and the person who wants to do everything in the light and everything above board and everything where everybody can see it and who does not have to explain his position over a four hour margarita fest at Applebee's, but rather can simply let the record speak for itself. That person's usually the good guy. And here that's Nehemiah. Nehemiah has recollection and memory and remembrance on his side. The wall is a testimony to that. His job is a testimony to that. These few words he's used, which are much more memorable than many words, is a testimony to that. As enemies, they're constantly messing with truth, with remembrance. They're trying to throw as much crap and obfuscation at the wall as they possibly can to muddle up the memory and the reality of the situation to cause confusion and despair to make people's hands weak. The bad guys do things in the shadows. The good guy does things above board. The bad guys need hours, days, even weeks, tomes to explain why they were right. It's confusing a little bit. But when you see it, you'll understand, just give me several days to explain it. Nehemiah needs just a few words strung together in a sentence and the record of what he's doing and what he's accomplished that speaks for itself. Well maybe you're thinking that's probably it for all this fight and you're wrong. There's more to come and we'll get into the next very clever attempt to subvert Nehemiah next time around this time using religion. Interesting. Matthew stickers are going out this week to everybody who supports the program at any level. I've got everything on hand and we've been working on that. If for any reason your address isn't updated, please do that real quick because it's way more fun when you actually get the thing that I want to send you because there's really anything and I think you're going to like it.
