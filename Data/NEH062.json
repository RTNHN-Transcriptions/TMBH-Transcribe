I think that was the first political reality that I ever had explained to me. I didn't even have explained to me. I came to think of it. I just felt it. I think we all felt the Cold War back then. We knew there was a big, violent, dangerous enemy with weapons harnessed the power of the sun, it could melt us all. We never really heard from them or knew what they were mad about exactly, but they were dangerous. It was in our media, it was in our storytelling, it was in our schools. I remember doing the drills where we would get under the desk because apparently an eighth of an inch of Formica glued to a half inch of particle board will save you from a nuclear blast. But we did it to my credit. My mom and dad, I think, did a lot to blunt that fear tone, but still. If you grew up in the 80s, you were saturated in that. But as bad as it was, we all prayed that it would not go hot. Whatever. Hot war, cold war. That's the deal. How was the Cold War fought? Well, I watched it unfold in slow motion. It seemed like not much. It really, anything ever happened. It was not a lot of bullets or anything, at least not fired directly between the two parties. There were proxy wars. I remember fights and squabbles with a team that we backed and a team that they backed in parts of the world that if you picked up a globe, you would never guess that would be the part of the world that people would need to fight over. That's sort of how it was played and spies, James Bond stuff and undermining and manipulation and misinformation and despair campaigns. Those seem to be the tools of the trade, the way that fight was fought. That's very different than a hot war where maybe you try all that other stuff first, but then eventually you just get weapons and you fight each other. In a way, I feel like that's the evolution of tension that we're getting here in the book of Nehemiah between the enemies of the rebuilding and the people who are committed to the rebuilding. We're only getting the tip of the iceberg of the fight here in Ezra and Nehemiah. There's a whole historic thing to completely different narratives and views of history that are in conflict here. There's also just basic selfishness in conflict here. I don't think every single person whistling as they worked on this wall was crystal clear on the whole grand scheme of redemptive history like Nehemiah was and Ezra before him. I think there were people that, well, I think it's very biblically safe for me to say this because the prophets who were writing at this time make this clear. There were people who went back and they returned from exile because they thought it was a good economic opportunity. They wanted to build their Persian style houses and just have it out in the colonies out at the far end of the world and they were there and they were being selfish and the prophets said so. I think there were other people who saw the story and they were right on board, but either of those motives would put them in great tension with San Balot and his ilk. The people who are pursuing their own enrichment, pursuing the growth of their own power, but also who are operating in their own empowering narrative about their own people group and what they're overcoming and how things ought to be for their view of things to work out and play out properly in history. It starts to come to a head early in the book of Nehemiah and initially you get Cold War tactics. We've been through most of those. You get the despair campaign. You get the gossip. You get the undermining. You get the, what are they calling it now? When you try to weaponize the courts against people, the law fair thing, that is the unjust use of the legal system to try to destroy your enemy. You get the backroom court jockeying, writing letters back and forth to the king. None of these things seem to be working for the people who are opposing the building because the wall just keeps going up. All of Nehemiah chapter three is a giant build montage that maybe takes us up to about halfway through the building. Maybe we're jumping forward and jumping back timeline wise and that's a summary of the whole building. But, but either way, the building of that wall is it's going up. That's a buffer bar that is right in front of the faces of the enemies of the building, San Balot and his crowd. Every little gap in the wall that starts to fill in, every additional foot of height that that wall goes up is that much closer to a real bad outcome for them in this Cold War and that outcome would be Jerusalem and the returning exiles get back on their feet in a defensible position where they don't have to burn sideways energy on defense. They can start to develop their civilization. They can start to build again. That's very dangerous if you're an enemy of the Jews because the Jews are sleeping giant at this point. They've got a crystal clear identity. They've got a history. They've been chastened by history or God as it is and frankly, their narrative looks to be a lot more cohesive and powerful even from an entirely secular point of view than the narrative that San Balot and his people have. You don't want these people to rise to their feet and get a wall around their city. They will be firmly ensconced plus they have the favor of the Achaemen and Emperor. It's a generational favor that has been entrenched because Mordecai was a good right-hand man, a generation earlier. Esther solved a gigantic crisis, but she did it without burning her husband and ruining all of his credibility. She was very shrewd in that. I think that paid generational dividends. Nehemiah is buddy buddy with Artaxerxes. No, San Balot lost. That's just the deal is the wall goes up and the buffer bar moves toward full completion and ultimately his defeat. It's clear. He lost. There is one recourse left when you get to that level of desperation and it is violence. And now the sword starts to rattle and now the threats start to come in that indeed this is going to go from a cold war to a hot war. But when San Balot, Tabaya, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed. They were very angry. There's that buffer bar. Nehemiah 4, 8, they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it. But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat. I really like that sentence. We prayed to our God. Also we got outswords. Make of that whatever you will. Ezra, one book earlier is like, okay, you know, we prayed to God. We believe God is in this. And so we just headed out with a few billion dollars or whatever. And we just walked along a bandit infested highway and figured it'd probably work out. And it did. Here Nehemiah, who's always been a bit more practical than Ezra in his leadership, is like we prayed to God. Well, yeah, we see that every time Nehemiah faces trouble, just like Jesus in the desert, he turns to God. But also we posted a guard. And I think that's entirely rational on his part. Short of some miraculous word from God to be like, don't even postcards. Just your faith in me. Just don't. Short of that probably makes sense to put somebody up there to keep an eye out because all of your enemies who've been trying to undermine you are now saying, we're going to physically hurt you and kill you. I go, okay, well, we'll add a security detail then to try to make it harder for you to kill us. Yeah, that checks out. Meanwhile, the people in Judah said the strength of the laborers is giving out and there's so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall. Ah, ha, there we go. All of the other despair campaigns, all of the Cold War stuff, the people of Jerusalem, they were built to handle that crap, bro. That did not overwhelm them. Think about what happened to generation earlier with Haman. There's a public decree sent out. It's like, hey, you know, the Jews, we're going to kill all of them. That's the plan. We're just going to circle a date on the calendar where that's sure that we can get away with this government. We're going to do that. Nobody could do anything about it until Esther and Mordecai cooked up a plan to intervene. It's insane. That just happened a few years ago at this point in Nehemiah chapter four. No, I think the Jews had pretty thick skin. They'd heard a lot of mean insults. They'd heard a lot of gossip. They'd seen a lot of ugly policy from the Cold War era come and go, but the actual threat of actual people with actual swords coming to fight them when they're not in military mode at all. We're not in sword mode. We're in travel mode. We're fixing things. There's just too many rocks. There's too much rubble. We can't contend with all the rubble and all the mess and learning how to build walls. While all of our businesses are currently suspended, we're not doing business or making money. We're all just building walls. We can't do that if you add this one more difficulty to it. That one more difficulty is people are just going to come up and do gorilla attacks on us and murder us while we're trying to build walls. It's too much. It is not surprising the strength of the laborers started to give out. Can you blame them? Finally, after generations of saber rattling, it looks like this is going to go from Cold War to hot war and they're just not in a place where they're equipped to handle it. It's really why they need to get this wall built because you build the wall and anybody has ever played any kind of strategy game or anything like this. It knows that the defense value of each and every one of those defenders, skyrockets, grows exponentially as soon as you've got that wall up. Here we are. It's a conundrum. It's 11. Also, our enemies said before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and we'll kill them and put an end to the work. So it gives you an idea too that the kind of attacks they were expecting, we're not the kind of attacks where you all line up on a battlefield and declare your intent and you wear uniforms and you charge at each other and then you fight until the sun goes down and you collect the bodies or whatever. They really are talking about terrorist attacks. They're talking about sneaking in among the laborers and one fell swoop, striking a few down and you don't know who's who and you don't know why people are there and anybody you see anywhere could be your enemy with a sword hidden under their tunic ready to stab you in the back. The second your hands are full with bricks or mortar or whatever. Again, it's sideways energy. If all your energy is focused on building a wall, maybe you can do that. If all your energy is focused on fighting off somebody who wants to kill you, that's not fun. You can do that, but the divided energy, that pressure that is being put on the Jewish people while they're rebuilding at this point, that is threatening to be too much. And for the first time, we're seeing the people we're rooting for start to wobble and it looks like this thing might not work out. And next time around, we'll see what Nehemiah does in response to this as a leader. Right here in my right hand, I have got the super special edition hologram version of the Matthew Achievement Unlocked sticker that we're about to send out to everybody who supports program. Listen to this thing. It's durable. Check it out. Listen. It's not all flimsy. It's got some girth to it. It can take a hit. And I love the design on this one. It's crown with jewels and everything like you typically expect pointing up. And then the crown also like reflects down. And that's a crown of thorns. So the ideas to communicate Matthew is all about the kingdom and Jesus is the king. Jesus is the fulfillment of the promises for this great king that would show up, descended from David and set all of this stuff straight and rain forever. All of those motifs from the Old and the New Testament come together in Jesus and the Book of Matthew. And I think this bit of art, the Bethany designed for this really gets it done in terms of communicating it. I love it. I've got most of these already ordered in. So we're ready to start enveloping these things up. If you want this, anybody who supports in any way at any level on any platform, we're going to send you one. Everybody is going to get at least the gold outline special edition sticker. This hefty hologram one will be sent out to a small handful of people who have gone way above and beyond in support of this thing. If anybody wants to just go and buy the stickers, you can always do that too. There's a white outline version that we have on the website. I'm really excited about the whole sticker program here. And I know some of you are probably like as stickers. I don't care. But you should because look, it's just too easy when you're very practically minded person. And my guess is that many of you are very practically minded. It's too easy to do things in life that matter, but be so forward focused that you never stop to commemorate and appreciate taking ground or achieving a thing or doing something significant. And I think I'm one of these people. I think I'm head down, move forward all the time. And so the sticker thing is as much for me as it is for anyone to stop and appreciate what we did together. That's a lot of work and it really matters. And we took ground that will pay dividends for the rest of our lives. And this is just a small way to market. And I think that's a really big deal. And I'm very excited to share these with you. Okay, that's plenty for today. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
