I cried in public again. This keeps happening. I don't think I cry a lot. I don't think that's my thing. But it's going to end up being my reputation if I'm not careful. This time it was at a piano recital. This is my daughter's piano recital. And I remember years earlier listening to her clomp through when the saints go marching in. And gradually through the years, she's become much better. Somewhere in there, she became elegant and learned to feel the music a little bit. The kids did great. There wasn't a thing wrong with any of it. You're there to dutifully listen to kids who were in the process of learning, mash through very simple songs. And as you get further into the recital, the kids who were more advanced play, and you tend to perk up a little bit. But all the dads were kind of subtly checking scores and stuff like that. And the moms were a little zoned out as well. My daughter got to go up there and she starts playing Claire D'Alune, which is lovely. It's the Oceans 11 Water Fountain sequence at the end after they pull off the heist. And she starts playing. Oh, my friends. It was a beautiful moment. The dads all sort of perked up like, well, this is art. This is really lovely. And you can see the phone starts to turn off and more eyes up. You could see moms do the hush hush thing toward their kids at the hand like, okay, all right. My little girl, she didn't know she was up there playing the thing. But her thing is gentleness. That really is her vibe. That's her style. She's very conscientious and very delicate, very gentle. And so this piece was a perfect fit for that. And it was so meaningful to watch the room feel it. This first time I've ever seen in her life that she has had the room and she didn't even know she's played her piece beautifully. And we did not get very far in. And I was appreciating what the moment was. And I started to tear up and I started to cry pretty hard. It didn't make sounds, but I was, it wasn't subtle. It was both cheeks. Like there was no hiding it right. And the chairs, they're all connected together. So any vibration or slight crying jiggling translates to the chairs around me. So my other two kids figured it out and they're always terribly amused when I cry about things. But it was powerful. Come on. It was powerful. It was a moment. Maybe you had to be there. Maybe you didn't. Hopefully at least somebody's crying now too so I can feel less alone. You know what it's like to experience a moment. That term connotates that it isn't just you who felt it. At least one other person is feeling it with you, but usually it means the room is feeling it. Something is happening here all at once and you can't science it. You can't tangible it. You can't even word it. You can't describe it, but you know what that is. You know what a moment is. And it's okay that emotion would really naturally come out of that. That is what we're getting on September 27th, 444 BC in Nehemiah chapter eight. We're getting an ancient description of a moment simultaneously. A whole bunch of people are moved by this thing even moved to tears by the reading of the book of the law. That doesn't sound like the kind of thing that would have that effect on people. It sounds like the kind of thing that would bore people or that they would slog through because they really have to do it, but it isn't the case. That isn't what's described. Ezra, the priest is leading this thing tenderly and with thoughtfulness. It isn't about making him look cool or some kind of vindication. I marched my butt all the way over here from Persia uphill, both ways carrying all of your stuff when nobody thought this was a good idea today. Anybody want to go with old Ezra? No, I don't think so. That's a fool's errand they said, but did that stop me? No, I did it anyway. Well, now here all of you are. And I guess we've found out what's right. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. It isn't about him. This isn't some weird shot and Freud payoff for the dude. It is all about the people who were there. And I've never thought that about Ezra until this conversation with you over the last couple of weeks or whatever. It's the first time I've picked up on this aspect of what he did because it's the first time I've gone slow enough to catch it, I guess. And I'm very impressed by how much self glorification he's leaving on the table and how much he's making it about all the people who were there making it about being understood. He's so comfortable in his own skin that instead of demanding that all of the conversation have to run through him, he's got his team of Levites to go and explain it. It doesn't have to come straight from his mouth. He's given them permission to paraphrase and make it work. And in eight nine, we get to the part where now we can really tell it's a moment. I may start in verse eight, eight because that kind of sets it up. They read from the book of the law, making it clear and giving the meaning so that people could understand what was being read. Then Nehemiah, the governor, Ezra, the priest and scribe and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, this day is sacred to the Lord, your God, do not mourn or weep for all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the law. It got through the armor. They're having a moment. I've seen people try to fake this. I've seen people try to schedule it one time in college. Some other college was having a religious revival. And so some people on our campus were like, we got to have one of those too. And they tried so hard to make revival happen, but they needed to stop trying to make revival happen. It's not going to happen. It's not like that anyway. It was weird and it was forced. These things happen when they happen. And here the heart was right. The mind was right. The day was right. The setting was right. The personalities were right for the people to be soft hearted, broken hearted, even over the reading of this ancient law. Why were they so sad and crying? Well, I think in part because of a realization that they didn't do it. I think the crowd has finally caught up with what Nehemiah understood and prayed in Nehemiah chapter one. I know I keep going back to this prayer all the time. I think it's really important. This is Nehemiah praying to God. Oh Lord God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands. Let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house of committed against you. We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws that you gave your servant Moses. And there's more after that where he quotes back to Deuteronomy and God's promises to put things back together and all of that's there. Nehemiah, as we've been saying, all along is a dude who understands the moment. He understands where he fits into it. And that's why he's broken hearted. And that's why he can't help but make this problem that's happening half a continent away. His own problem, priority one, he's weeping. Remember he's super sad in the presence of Artaxerxes and Artaxerxes catches it. And he's like, you've never been sad in my presence before. What's going on? Now all the stuff that Nehemiah got, whatever it's been a few months earlier, now the crowd gets one guy had a vision for this. One guy understood what this was about and he's not even the one reading the book of the law or interpreting it to people. He's just standing there. But now everybody's catching on to what Nehemiah saw in the first place. There's a powerful image of leadership when what you think isn't particularly popular and nobody has caught it yet. Nobody gets why it's important. It's not the narrative yet. But eventually through his leadership and a bunch of other factors as well, they come around. But also it doesn't look like Nehemiah and as were anybody else are doing the emotion merchant thing, which is gross. It's not my favorite. I know there are a lot of people who like it. Okay, fine. Cool. We can get along or whatever. There are people who like to be pumped for emotion so that it feels like a thing happened. But when everything special, nothing is when everything is a moment, nothing is a moment. But the impulse of Nehemiah and Ezra and the leaders are to comfort them. This day is sacred to the Lord. You don't need to mourn. You don't need to weep. But this is not the first time that there's been a mass weeping event, a mass public crying event in Ezra and Nehemiah. But the last time it happened, there was no comfort offered. It was left ambiguous. This is in Ezra chapter three after the foundation of the temple is put in place. We're back in time about a hundred years before the events of September 27th, 444 BC back here in Ezra three. Ezra is not alive at this point or, you know, he was, he's a teeny tiny little baby. He's not here. This is a flashback in the book of Ezra and it says, and all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. That's Ezra three, 11 now 12. But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads who had seen the former temple wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid while many others shouted for joy. No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping because the people made so much noise and the sound was heard from far away. And that's it. Then we're back into some tension, their enemies and stuff like that. There's no comfort. There's no resolution to that story. There's just open ended heartache and it's not a heartache of optimism, at least for half of the room. The people who were crying in Ezra chapter three are crying because something is broken and something will never be the same. But now in the next mass crying event here in Nehemiah chapter eight, there is comfort. Why are they comforting them here? Because they're deeply rooted in that material from Deuteronomy that promise that Nehemiah was praying in Nehemiah chapter one, that they're cashing in on here. They're cashing in on a promise that God made that if their hearts turn, even if they're far from home someday, God will restore them and he will rebuild this thing and he will bless them again. He'll reestablish this relationship between them and it's happening right here on September 27th, 444 B.C. And it's been building to this renewal of the covenant and this refreshing of ancient things that have been mostly lost for a hundred years in this return from exile process that we've been looking at. And now here we are. It's understandable that people's hearts are broken by what they're hearing. It's understandable that what they're hearing, the standards and characters of God, that benchmark, that high bar that is set, they know they don't come anywhere close. Every single one of them is guilty. Every one of them has fallen short of the glory of that high bar that God has set. But the gift of God is present here as well and it's forgiveness and it's establishing something new, something that they didn't even understand at this moment that would be even bigger than this earthly province they're rebuilding. There's an eternal kingdom that they're going to inherit even though they've all fallen short of that high bar of the glory of God, the standards of God. So this is good. Their hearts are broken. The character of God, the high standards of God, I think that's the effect it's supposed to have on us throughout the Bible. I think normal readers are supposed to look at them and be like, dang, I'm not that. I don't live up to that. I don't do that. I'm not sure that if every day were my best day, I could ever pull that off or even come close. The whole Bible as it relates to the standards of God is meant to cause the reader not to despair because we can't do that. But ultimately a little bit preachy here, Billy. This is what the Bible says is what we do, but ultimately not to despair, but to turn to Jesus. That's why the whole Jesus thing happened. That's why the cross and the resurrection and the teachings of Jesus about the kingdom and the idea that access to that kingdom is a work of benevolence, of grace by God, unmerited by the person who is brought into that kingdom, the person whose eyes are opened, whose ears are opened, whose heart is broken and who receives forgiveness from God and who is brought into the new kingdom, the family of faith by God. So there's something really powerful happening right here in this moment, really powerful. This is meaningful. There's a reason that churches for two millennia since the time of Christ have taken some of the cues about how they do church from this last chunk of the book of Nehemiah because this is sort of a template for what it looks like when a whole bunch of people respond to the ancient truth of the law of God and the character of God with brokenheartedness and receptiveness to what it looks like to do an about face and follow God and to be a part of his kingdom. So there's something really exciting here and we're just going to take our time and keep unpacking this very important chapter, not just in Nehemiah but in the whole Bible as we keep cruising along. All right, that's plenty for now. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
