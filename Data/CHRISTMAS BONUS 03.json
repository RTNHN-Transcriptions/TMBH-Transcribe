This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and we are in the middle of a special week of the podcast here where we're looking at a passage from Matthew chapter 2 as we get ready for next week's launch of the new season, the new series on the book of Nehemiah. I want to check in real quick before we do the next chunk of Matthew 2 thing that we're doing this week to tell you that I'm sending stuff out right now. Today and tomorrow we're getting everything packaged up. Everything is in. I've got it. Your Nehemiah books are coming out for everybody who currently supports at any level. You're getting one of those Nehemiah Field Notes books. They look awesome. And then the Esther Achievement Stickers in honor of what we just accomplished together. Those are in. They are so stinking cool. I love them. They're so busy who is supporting in any way, at any level, on any platform. You're going to get one with the cool gold outline. This is a way of saying thank you. That's just going to show up along with your Nehemiah book. And for anybody else who would like to get one of those Esther Achievement Stickers, there's a white outline version that is now available on the website. I wanted it to just be 10 bucks. You can click on the thing. It's 10 bucks. It's like, oh, it's the easiest thing I ever did. It was just 10, 10 bucks. No funny business. And then I just get it. But it doesn't work that way. Apparently, to make everything work, it's got to be four bucks. And then it's six bucks for shipping and handling and the tax and whatever. But it adds up to 10 bucks. So it's 10 bucks. I know a few of you went and bought it and you got charged shipping on top of that. We gave you your money back. It's ridiculous. You're 16 bucks for a sticker? That's insane. 10 bucks? That makes perfect sense. Totally rational. There, thetmbh.com or thetmbh.com slash shop, all of that stuff is happening. I'm real excited about it. And I'm already tearing into Nehemiah and I'm probably going to hit record on that tomorrow. And I'm super, super excited to get started on that new season. So there, that's everything. That was all my stuff. All right. Matthew chapter two, picking it up where we left off. Here we go. After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem. I've talked about King Herod, who are the Magi. This is a little bit easier. We're almost sure that this would have been a special class of fortune telling dream interpreting experts from Babylon. We know this because Magi using the same kind of language and the same kind of description are repeatedly referenced in Daniel. Do you remember when Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were vexing the Nebuchadnezzar and he called together his Magi and sorcerers and all of this stuff to sort the thing out? It's in chapter one and chapter two, if you want to look it up for yourself, of the book of Daniel. And when Daniel was called upon to interpret dreams, it was because the Magi could not deliver on those interpretations. I assume, and I think for good reason, that the Magi we're talking about here would have been descended from the same group of experts, the same class of people. It raises the question, how do we get the idea that these people were kings? The answer to that involves a document from the 9th century and some embellishments. Some people look at a prophecy in the Old Testament about all the kings of the nations bowing down before Jesus. One person made the connection and said, well, this is probably how that was fulfilled. And then it went off and ran, but almost certainly there's nothing kingly about these people at all. They were Magi or wise men. You'll notice that no number is listed. The whole three kings also is complete speculation. It looks like eventually people said, well, they brought the three gifts, so there must have been three kings that would have been insane to travel over the Silk Road with that kind of wealth with three guys unaccompanied. I'm sure it was a giant retinue, a ton of people, and there's no need whatsoever to think that there were just three. It could have been dozens. It could have been a group. We just know there's more than one. They asked, where is the one who's been born? King of the Jews, we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him. That's kind of an interesting moment in this passage, because again, for us, it's just kind of confusing. You saw a star or something, and now you believe in Jesus? How did you connect these dots? How did you add up the details sufficiently to even know what to look for? But there are many sources, and one in particular, a Roman historian named Sootonius, who write that the expectation permeated the ancient world, especially in the east, that the ruler of the world would come out of Judea, that there was some great king coming from here, and that just makes sense. I mean, you know, that history story that I've walked you through 10 billion times about Abraham and Moses and David, the divided kingdom and the exile and all of that. Every single time something happens in that story, Jews are distributed around the ancient world, and they take with them their prophets and their scriptures and all of this stuff. While they were in Babylon, they had a thriving religious community, and people would have heard the expectation that a great king would be coming out of their homeland under Persia, the same thing would happen amongst the Greeks and Asia Minor in Egypt. All over the world, people were hearing the same insistence from the Jews, and they had some miraculous history to back up that claim. And we're not talking about a year or two of this kind of history, either. We're talking about many, many, many centuries of this being repeated. It would have entered into the lore and into the expectations over that amount of time. So these magi see some kind of star. What is the star? I don't know. Lots of people are pretty sure they know, but every theory has serious flaws to it. Kepler, remember, astronomer from the Age of Enlightenment? He had all kinds of theories about what this is. Some have theorized that Jupiter aligned with Saturn, aligned with a star from the constellation Pisces, and they kind of glom together and Jupiter is representative of the East, and Saturn is representative of the Jews, to ancient astrologers, and so they figured it all out. But the dates don't quite work out, and how would that look like a star? That would look like a bunch of stars, and they wouldn't be close together. So that seems forced to me. Kepler proposed the idea that maybe it was a supernova that came and went quickly. I guess that could be, but the idea of that being oriented to the same place doesn't make any sense. The bottom line is we can try to come up with some kind of fun. Hey, look at that. We came up with an astronomy solution to a supernatural question kind of answer, but I think it's going to be unsatisfying. The Bible says that what we're dealing with is a star that moved, that was supernaturally presented to these people to get them to another place, and that the star led them to a house. Is there any star that could lead you to somebody else's house? It's not how stars are. Just think about the relationship between us and heavenly bodies that they're not good for as a Google Maps alternative. And so this star, in my estimation, probably was something just ridiculously supernatural that maybe would have escaped the notice of an uninformed person glancing up at the sky, but that these people could not possibly miss, and they knew there had to be something to it. Another reason I think it must have been supernatural is because it took them two years and unbelievable amounts of money to walk across Asia to chase a star. I've had some whims. Like one time, I was like, you know what I want? Little Caesars, but I'd have to drive all the way to Riverton. So I did. It costs like 12 bucks plus the cost of fuel. Pretty spontaneous. You know what's never occurred to me? Whoa, the stars look weird tonight. I should walk across Asia for two years. The fact that this was their behavior means something about this was very, very compelling and out of the ordinary to people who would know that it was compelling and out of the ordinary. They go on this trip and Herod is clever. When Herod heard this, he was disturbed and all Jerusalem with him. I don't think all Jerusalem knew. I think all Jerusalem is a reference to, you know, like when I say, well, you know, that's how Washington does things. I don't mean George Washington. I don't mean Washington state. I don't mean some dude who owns a barbecue joint in Washington, D.C. I mean the people who make up the government, right? You all know the expression. Likewise, all Jerusalem would be a reference to all the decision makers, the movers, the shakers, the religious elite. Why are they disturbed? Well, I think this brings us back to the Mad Max thing. They've got a racket going. And now you know the story of how this racket happened. It involved all kinds of manipulations and assassinations and Julius Caesar factored in there somehow. And Mark Antony and Cleopatra and wars and intrigue and murdering people's moms. And this was very, very, very difficult to build. It's an awful situation. And the place got conquered by the Greeks. It got conquered by some other Greeks. It got reconquered by some Jews. Then it got reconquered by the Romans. Everybody's killing everybody. Hey, these are difficult bad times, but somebody's got to sit on the throne during difficult bad times. Why not Herod? Why not the religious leadership? They found a way to parlay a disastrous moment in history into enormous power for themselves. And so Jerusalem, like Herod, would have been on high alert that something was going to bust up their racket.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.72, "text": " Hey everybody,
