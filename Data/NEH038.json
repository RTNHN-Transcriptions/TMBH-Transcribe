And the first time I can remember experiencing this is when I was in high school and the place that this occurred was outside the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Illinois. Now, I know that Chicago, Illinois is maybe not at its all time high in terms of reputation right now with outsiders. I think, you know, who knows what the news gives you and what it doesn't. But it seems like maybe people would look at Chicago from a distance and say, that's a town that's struggling a little bit right now. I don't know. Maybe it isn't. What I know is I love Chicago and I love to live in there as a kid. I mean, I went to college there and then I went back after a while for some extra school there as well. And so I always have a soft spot in my heart for that place and always give it the benefit of the doubt go Chicago. That said, as a high school kid, that was a big city, it was a dangerous place. I don't know what to make things. And we were there in the age before cell phones and we got separated from our other car with our other friends and like all the wives and the ladies, they were in one vehicle. And I was with the dads, my friend in another vehicle, we got separated. There was no way to reconnect. And the reason we got separated is because as I recall the story, we locked the keys in our car in downtown Chicago. And what are you going to do, right? How do you reconnect that you can't get to the rendezvous point? You just have to, I guess, wait there until the other party comes back, but that's a big city. I'm not sure they knew how to get back. And so we're kind of fretting over it. I mean, the dads are having a good sense of humor, but then a dude walks up who did not look like our dads at all just from a different world and different probably mentality and culture. He walked up, he figured out what was going on and was like, ah, I know somebody who can figure that out. And he just made it his problem. He didn't want anything. He didn't take anything from us even when it was offered. He just helped us get back into the car. He had a buddy that did like lock and towing service and he was just in the neighborhood. So he stopped by and did it and they wouldn't take any money from us. Are you kidding me in Chicago, Illinois? Yes. I believe that is still the soul of that city. That story makes me very, very happy. And it might not happen that often, but come on. All of this is some point or another. I've been lucky enough to see somebody take something that isn't their problem and make it their problem. And it feels like that's what Nehemiah is trying to do in Nehemiah one in this action packed chapter. It's not his job to go and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. It's not his calling or mission to go and fix that. He already has a super important job, bro. He's the cup bearer to the king. And we'll talk more about what that means, but it's, I mean, it's a huge, gigantic deal. And he hears this report about what's going on. And all of a sudden that becomes his problem. He doesn't do it rashly. He takes a couple of days and he thinks real hard about what needs to happen. And he thinks real hard about his own role and what has gone wrong. And he thinks real hard, like we've been talking about for the last few days, about the big grand story of the whole thing that you and I refer to as the Old Testament. And then he looks at this moment in history and like his colleague, Ezra, he's able to assess it and realize, yeah, this is a big moment. Right here, somebody needs to step up and do something. Ezra's a little bit outmatched for this part of the job back in Jerusalem. But I might be in a position to make this problem that is commissioned for other people. That is other people's thing to deal with. I could make this problem my problem. And I think the moment where Nehemiah works that through is in just saying, it's in verse four, when it says, when I heard these things, the report about the people being in distress, and Jerusalem, and the gates being burned, and the walls being torn down, he says, when I heard these things, I sat down and wept for some days. I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. Then I said, see what I'm saying? This dude took a good chunk of time for unprompted, unscripted, unstrategic prayer and reflection and big picture thinking. And then when he has his thoughts in order, we get into the prayer that we've been looking at now for some time. Oh Lord God of heaven, the great and awesome God. You can just say, remember the instructions you gave your servant Moses. If you are unfaithful, I'll scatter you among the nations, but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I'll gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my name. Verse 10, there your servants and your people whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand. Oh Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revearing your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man. I was cut bearer to the king. Look at what he's going to do. He is going to take all the credibility he's earned. He's going to take his cushy position and he's going to risk that by going and appealing to the king of kings, the king of everything, Artaxerxes, the great, achaemenid king of Persia and nearly the whole world. He's going to risk his comfort and his reputation with that guy to make a problem that isn't his problem be his problem. And the thing is he's owning it too. As we've talked about and he says, this all happened, all of this ruin of the people and of the city. It happened because of my sin, my father's sin and my forefather's sin. We own this. I own this. We've acted very wickedly toward you. We've not obeyed the command to decrees and laws. You gave your servant Moses. And so the first two chunks of the prayer are we blew it. You're doing everything you said. But speaking, chunk two of everything you said you would do. Hey, remember that stuff that you said to Moses? And I think he's also probably drawing on the stuff that he said to Solomon that you and I looked at over the last few days. Remember that? I would like to invoke that clause. I want my heart to be right. I want our heart to be right. And I want to go make this problem, my problem. Would you bless me in those efforts? Like Abraham, he pleads for his family. They're your servants and your people whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand. And then remember how in all the business in Deuteronomy 30 and then again, around the dedication of the temple and second chronicles are that explicit language from God. About if you do that, my eyes will be open to see you. My ears will be open and attentive to hear you. And Nehemiah draws on that exact language. Oh, Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this, your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revereing your name. Give your servant success today in what by granting him favor in the presence of this man. And again, that man is art as Xerxes. How much stuff my friends, does this remind you of from all over the Bible and don't feel weird if you haven't read the Bible before or this is sort of your toe in the water for learning stuff about the Bible and thinking about the Bible. If you're new to all of this, and I'm just going to tell you, it's a lot. It's drawing on so much. How much of this rhymes with Esther, right? I mean, you got to take this big risk. You got a preferred position before the king. And now for such a time as this, it has been ordained that you would go before the king and cash in every bit of credibility that you have earned with that king by being faithful and loyal and likable and winsome and willing to put your neck on the line for their well-being. Nehemiah went and did exactly what all of the Jews were instructed to do when they went into exile. Jeremiah, the prophet talked about this one. Basically, the message was, hey, you're all going to get taken into exile. Don't worry. I still have plans to prosper you and not harm you. I'm not giving up on you, says the Lord paraphrases lightly mine. It'll come back around eventually, but in the meantime, go and be great citizens. Go and work for the well-being of the city of the country, of the kingdom that you are in. And it's just wild to me that in Esther and Nehemiah, really, in Ezra as well, it's just that. It's people who went and handled their business well with their neighbors. Nehemiah, Ezra, Esther, they made a billion little right decisions, little self sacrificial decisions to ignore an indignity here or there to make sure they did the honest thing instead of the easy thing here and there. A gajillion times, those three people had the opportunity to cut corners, to be shady, to say critical things, gossipy things about people behind their back to get ahead at the expense of others. And a billion times, they chose not to do it. They got no credit for it. I'm sure nobody was following them around being like, I see what you did there, Nehemiah. Good job being thoughtful of others. Good job, Ezra. That was selfless. I see what you did there. That was really nice of you. Man, Esther, you could have just thrown all those other girls in the contest under the bus, but instead you were kind to everyone. I see it. They probably didn't get credit for all those things. People don't normally see those little things in mass, but the sum of all of going and being good citizens, decent people functioning in keeping with the values of God and treating other people well, all of that stuff adds up to a reputation, a position of trustworthiness that is exactly the formula that God himself in the middle of the book of Jeremiah said would be the formula for straightening out this big problem. And now here, Nehemiah is in the same situation. Esther was 40 years earlier outside the throne room doors, getting ready to walk in and have a high risk conversation with the sovereign of the world and not knowing how this is going to play out, hoping that he had banked enough equity in this relationship in the same way that Esther hoped she had banked enough equity in her relationship with Artaxerxes dad to go in and have this huge request granted. In this case, the request from Nehemiah is, Oh, great king, will you let me make someone else's problem? My problem. And whereas I imagine that Esther's prayers about this probably did happen, but they all happen off screen. God's name doesn't even get mentioned in the book of Esther. Here it happens on screen. And in our coming conversations, we're going to find out how it goes between him and the king. Hey, Chicago, I've heard it maybe hasn't been the easiest run of late, but I will never forget how nice you were to me in my family when we were a kid. And I'll never forget how nice you were to me when I was there for college and school. High five Chicago. Thank you for making my problem your problem. All right, that's it. I'm Matt.
