the kids and i were having a debate as we are want to do from time to time the other day about who's the most irreplaceable most important character in star wars all those movies and that we thought about all the impressive ones in the big names and ultimately what we decided as we went through all the little plot beats in our heads was this a little blue and white rolling trash can it's our two d two if you take our two d two out of the thing there's no point in anybody else showing up because there are a hundred little inflection points in the story where everything just goes off the rails and everything is ruined and i have no idea if george lucus or the people who took the baton from george lucus to continue telling the story to well took the baton then fumbled the baton then barbed on the baton then accidentally kicked the baton into flaming dumpster as the dumpster was being picked up and loaded on the back of runaway train and the runaway train was headed toward a tire fire and then the whole thing went off a cliff that kind of baton handoff i don't know if any of the people involved with this were trying to make some kind of deeper point but it's sort of accidentally does about all of these little things that had to bounce just the right way for good to win out in the end and in that regard surprising she where i'm going you can always see where i'm going the little bit of an ester flare to this whole thing because ester has got a mountain of little inflection points most of which have nothing to do with big flashy things are the biggest most imposing most impressive characters it seems like a bunch of little off the cuff decisions the bounce things the right way well they're not all little off the cuff decisions there's a whole bunch of things going on and yesterday we were talking about how the inflection point of the whole story is just it's a sleepless night that's it that's all it was we got all of these high stakes things going on it's not a big courtroom drama or some big reveal or somebody stabs somebody nope it's not that that's how things usually work in Persian drama here is just i can't sleep and oh some books where i wrote down some things reminded me of the thing that i forgot to get right i should get that right that's it that's what did it but whereas george lucus and whoever it is taken over writing star words things since him seem to be making some kind of point using r2d2 as the narrative vessel to make this point about these flooky little small inflection points throughout that all had to go the right way all going the right way so it is that in ester we see so much of that across the board and it seems like now that evil vile hamon is impaled on gallows of his own making that it's a good time to reflect on all of the little things or some of the little things that get us to this point so think about this or you got the sleep of sight we talked about that a whole bunch already but then on top of that you've got eunuchs who are usually bad guys the original audience would have thought of them as being influencers of the king who influence the king toward destructive outcomes or selfish outcomes for eunuchs but here really they all behave very well and them being representatives of influence if anything would tell the original audience that god used these people this people group who are a metaphor for influence to influence and nudge the story in a way that was redemptive then on top of that you've got the theme of bad advice bad advice that hamon gets from his wife and his friends is a relatively small thing it's them shooting off their mouths a drinking party no big deal but it plays itself out in such a way that hamon erects the device of his own destruction well i mean isn't it something that the unit carbona is like well i mean that guy is a problem there are some gallows right there that were very recently built just saying so we have that little who would have thunk it shouldn't have that big a consequence is kind of thing but it happened at the right time and it happened in the right way that bad advice that is how about mortik i just sitting in the right place and here in the right thing the big thing in tarrish guys they could have plotted their assassination somewhere else they could have stood just a few feet away i mean heck think about it if all of that was overheard at the city gate what if there was just some noise you know what's weird that i'm observing the further into dadhood i get it said i hear things really really well unless that stupid ice dispenser is running and whenever the ice dispenser runs i just feel the simple said i have to fight to be angry about everything but people continue talking and that stupid ice dispenser it just makes noise at exactly the right frequency such that you can't hear anything what if an ice dispenser has been running when big the none tarrish we're talking about what they were going to do to the king and here's the thing tarrish the thing that we have to do that we've been talking about the evil plan that we need to carry out the plan that is to be executed today the plan that is that we are going to uh hey dad we're gonna and that is the thing we're going to do tarrish what if that had happened right then one more cut hasn't here anyways there's like some poop cart rolling by or some big band parade or something he misses all of that stuff so just the fact that he heard it because i'm sure they didn't just tell him that is a huge deal in and of itself heck let's go back even further how about the fact that ester got chosen at all in the first place and it looks like more to kind might have had a hand in nudging it toward that but ester's passive and all of it remembers she just got taken she got entered in this contest what if ester goes first in the contest is the king gonna pick her no i don't think so he wanted to sample the goods and so the contest runs for a really long time and it's not just i think that she was very charming it's also that the people who were rooting for her waited until the king was properly at that point of being a little bit bored ready to make a decision little tired of shopping maybe emotionally vulnerable a little bit and they were like tonight tonight is the night for ester did ester have a whole lot to do with the outcome of her fate yes she did because she brought talent and courage to the whole thing she brought social shrewdness and empathy to the whole thing that is awesome but she had to be positioned to bring those things to the whole thing and that looks like it happens through a bunch of flooky circumstances that the author of the text goes out of their way to say happened to her heck let's go way bigger into the all of history thing and talk about more of these flooky little r2d2 pivot points that all had to bounce a certain way what if esteria is still in power well esteria killed at ten of the twelve tribes of israel in seven thirty two b c and deported them and bred them out of existence in one of the worst attacks on the descendants of abraham in the history of ever what if esteria stays in charge you think they're just gonna let that southern kingdom sit where it is do you think the southern kingdom of juda with the remaining two tribes is so well run and so good at foreign policy that they're not eventually going to run afoul of esteria who takes no prisoners no no they're going to run afoul of esteria and esteria is going to wipe them out and then all we would know about the descendants of abraham the jewish people would be some stuff that we read on a plaque that's an interpretation of some relief from some building on a wall in ninnava that now sits at the british museum that says that there was some people group that history totally forgot that they also wiped out no esteria needed to go away they were a time bomb in order for any of this to move forward and they lose at the battle of car commision six oh five how do they lose at that battle well everybody else is on the same team for a little while the needs and the Persians and the babylonians and then the babylonians went out well the southern kingdom gets themselves into trouble quickly with them in five eighty six but even there nebbican eser is clearly portrayed as being influenced by the god of abraham and nebbican eser through the miraculous work of god never really is able to do away with this people group he has and somehow they managed to maintain an identity and part through the preaching of the prophets who said you're going to be taken into captivity go handle your business but about the time that the babylonians would forget those lessons under new leadership syrus the great comes along around five forty five thirty nine and he defeats the babylonians and syrus's heart as prophesied from days of old is going to be directed like a water course toward sympathy toward the jewish people so he issues an edict to send them back why would the ball bounce that way i don't know historically it doesn't make a ton of sense but it did but then the great persian patron of the jews dies and jews run into all kinds of opposition and syrus's successors don't seem to give a rip about any of the problems of the jews even though they're traveling in the same neighborhood as jerusalem camp i see spartia they don't care it's not on their radar we have no evidence of that but then a new surfer a weird dude with huge insecurities darius manages to snatch the throne well the result of that is that darius has to be doggedly loyal not to the rulings of camp i see some especially not to bardia the imposter he's got to be slavishly loyal to whatever syrus said which then causes things to bounce in the direction of something favorable to the jews again as darius gets petitioned and is like well i do whatever syrus declared because i am the next king rightly in line from him let me look into that and then they got to search all the royal archives and somehow in the least likely of all the royal archives some scribe some clerk manages to find it what a crazy way for that ball to bounce that's an r2d2 moment shouldn't have happened yet it does they find it and because of that darius doubles down even harder on his support for the jews and their rebuilding project and then he dies after getting beat by the Athenians late in his life and his son has a chip on his shoulder about the Athenians and so Xerxes gets together a war council everybody gets drunk and he's young and he's insecure and he's trying to impress people and as a result he accidentally gets duped into running off his queen and then he loses and is all depressed because everything goes wrong in greece and on the trip home and now he's sad and he needs a new queen and that gets us all the way back to the stuff that happens in the book of ester there are just so many things that had to bounce a certain way well what happens if they don't bounce a certain way well possibility number one is that Xerxes never really notices what's going on and haman carries out his attack possibility number two is that haman straight up climbs the ladder and becomes king himself he clearly wants to be clearly wants to wear the king's robes and smell like the king and be treated like the king and this sort of stuff happened i mean it happened one generation earlier with darius finding a way to usurp the throne so even if somehow the jews hadn't been taken into captivity in the first place and they still had a little micro kingdom way out west if haman who is an agogite were to usurp the throne from Xerxes even if Jerusalem had still been its own little teeny tiny kingdom he would have had an immediate grudge to bring to bear against them and there would have been no one to stop him or oppose him now there's just a zillion little r2d2 moments and it's not just the sleepless night it's reversal after reversal surprise after surprise seemingly inconsequential thing to the story that we eventually run into with the threat to the jewish people after seemingly inconsequential thing and they all end up going the right way for this to end up being a redemption story and that's the kind of thing that when you look at history sense or you look at the difficult circumstances of the world we live in in either local and immediate things that you can tend with or bigger global things that there's nothing you can really do about i think when you look at those things and think about things a book like ester and a step back and look at all the ways things bounce the right way under the provenance of god kind of exercise i think all of that is meant to be and ought to be on some level deeply reassuring even in the face of difficult things and i find myself encouraged by this book we've been investing in today that's it for now i'm matt this is the 10 minute bible hour podcast let's do
