And then I say it wrong. And especially when they were learning to talk, they get all upset and like, Hey kids, let's go to Rex's toadhouse. No, dad. You're saying it wrong. Texas Roadhouse. Oh, oh, oh. I'm not bad. Okay. And then gradually, of course, you know, they figured out that I'm just playing with them. And then they did me this great kindness, which is they started making up their own and trying to get a rise out of me. And I hope that we do it forever until the end of time. Well, they got this show that they watch that I called the Brit greatest shaking bro. But apparently the actual name is the great British baking show. And it's one of these reality shows where, you know, there's a contest or whatever in their stakes. The stakes really aren't that huge without exaggerating them using editing. And so there's this thing and you've all seen it. Have you seen any kind of show like what I'm describing? It's a thing where they get ready to announce the judge's decision. And they say, well, this was a tough one to call. But after talking about it, we've decided that. And then there's a pause and it shows the face of the contestants shows the face of the judge back to the contestant, back to the face of the judge, back to the, I could do this all day. It goes on for seemingly eternity. And then they announced the verdict and it's so overblown and it's so ridiculous. And I think it's just sort of symptomatic of this artificial attempt to create stakes and tension in the era of streaming when we're whatever, the better part of a hundred years into the age of television and movies and we're all just getting numb to everything. So yeah, you got to fake it. You got to make all of that hype happen there. So all of that said, I'm not really in a great place to evaluate how much hype the Bible should or should not have when we open it and read it. But I would say this for a book that has such amazing drama and such unlikely things happening on metaphorical screen, it's usually pretty chill about how it reveals those outcomes. It very rarely withholds what happens next to try to build tension or make you really wonder. I mean, when the action occurs, this spells it out. Then Jesus went up to the tomb and he was like, all right, Lazarus, just quit being dead. Come on out. And then Lazarus came out and that's it. You don't get then Jesus said, Lazarus, come forth. And then they looked at the tomb for a minute and then they looked at Jesus for a minute and then they looked at the tomb for a minute and then a tiny bead of sweat appeared on Jesus forehead. Then they looked at the tomb and nothing happened. Then they looked back at Jesus and the ladies who were there and they looked really nervous and embarrassed. Then they looked back at the tomb and then something happened. Lazarus, I mean, it just, it doesn't play like that. And sometimes it feels weird, I think, to our modern sensibilities that we get these really dramatic build-ups and then it's just, all right, well, here it is. This is what occurred. And that's what happens here in Esther chapter five. We've spent, what are we at now, like 98 episodes building up to this moment? Will it turn out that all of these providential events that have just happened to line up the way they have through the first four chapters of Esther is all of that going to add up that Queen Esther is going to be received by the king. Has she banked enough goodwill? Is she still the apple of the king's eye? Is she catching him in the right mood on the right day? It all comes down to one simple reality TV show like gesture. Who will the dude hand the rose to? Who will receive the totem? Who will be handed the trophy? Will the king raise his golden scepter to receive Esther or will he not? Here we are, the fate of the entire redemptive plan hinges on whether or not that scepter is raised to Esther or not. The fate of the entire story of the Jewish people hinges on this moment of eye contact. She's done everything she can to set this up the right way. The music gains tension. Esther looks in the mirror in her chambers one last time. She closes her eyes for one last moment of reflection. The doors of her chamber are swung open. She walks down the hall. Tense music builds. I'm making all of this stuff up but I'd like to imagine that it happened and then Esther five one. On the third day, Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace in front of the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall facing the entrance. When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and he held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. Cue the triumphant music. She has been received by the king. She has been granted an audience. She now has the most valuable, powerful possession in all of Persian culture in all of Persian commerce in all of Persian politics. She has a captive audience with the king of kings. But really, I mean, you got to admit, it was just a few simple sentences and all of the tension. Well, it's not all resolved, but certainly it feels to the attentive reader like, okay, well, she can just talk to him. She's going to find a way to get this thing worked out. We've at least cleared the first great big gigantic hurdle in this whole thing. I do think this scene is just remarkable. I mean, imagine what this young lady is feeling as she makes her way into this space. You got to hope that a couple of sympathetic unics are feeding her information about what the morning proceedings have been like in there. Is the king receiving tribute? Is he hearing a case? Is he planning with his counsel? You know what your workday is like. There are times when you're going to be more agreeable to an interruption than other times, right? There's going to be certain moments where you're like, hey, I just, I cannot break away from this right now. This is miserable, but it's important. And I just have to do it. Please, you know not to interrupt me during these things. And if you have kids, they kind of know what sort of activities during the day that they should not bother you during because they're not going to get the answer that they want. There are other things that happen during the day where once you get past them, you're in this great lighthearted mood because you got past the big hurdle and you're feeling wonderful about things. And the whole day is downhill from here. It's going to be all right. And if you have kids, they've probably figured out that that is a great time to approach you with a petition. You probably have things in your life that don't come up all the time, but when they do get out of your way, you are not hearing anything. You are not in the mood for it. This puts you in a completely other state of mind. And no matter how much you try to be mature about it, it just doesn't happen. And people really, really would be well advised to leave you alone. I've got to think that as sympathetic as this court seems to have been toward Esther, as much as she seems to have been the sweetheart of the palace from the very moment she showed up as a young lady, I've got to think that in the same way you got the little mice and birds and critters and all of those classic Disney tales always helping out the pure, fair princess. I got to think the same thing is happening for Esther here. And I think it's a very reasonable suspicion to imagine that somebody was feeding her information about when the right time to walk in would be. A time that would not embarrass the king, a time that would not interrupt the king, or heck, maybe a time that would interrupt the king and give him an excuse to get out of whatever he was doing without losing any face. I'm sorry. I'm sure your case is very, very important, but my elegant queen has arrived and I must receive her be gone. Or maybe she just fluked into it and walked in there at exactly the right moment. But whatever the case, it looks like she didn't have to have anyone push open the doors for her. She simply walked into the inner court of the palace in front of the king's hall. The king is sitting on the throne, facing the entrance and she doesn't even have to ask anything. Maybe she could even pass this off like she was just walking by. And it was almost the king who's highly influential, whose idea to call her in when he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand, probably more likely than just happening by. She assumed a proper position of respect before the king. Tomorrow we're going to talk about the artifacts, the art we have from the ancient Persian court. The characterizes what it looked like to come before the king. Maybe she just did everything so perfectly by the book that he was delighted by that, along with her beauty and was eager to welcome her in. Either way, however it happened, we know that it was a formal reception because by extending the scepter, he is communicating to everyone who is armed in that space that her approach is welcome and allowed and no one need be on guard over this. He is also signaling formally as the person who more than anyone else understands the commodity that is access to him. He is signaling that he is giving that very valuable thing freely to his queen as she is allowed to approach. So she approaches, she touches the tip of his scepter and as we move forward in the text in coming days, we'll talk about what she is going to do with this access that she's gained. How is she going to play her hand in this particular situation? I don't know. Maybe I've backdoor sneaky talked myself into thinking that this actually is a really dramatic presentation. Yeah, I guess I'd put it this way. It's not cheap drama like what we get from silly overhyped reality shows where you have 10 minutes of content and you're trying to fill in hours worth of time. Instead, I would say this is actual drama that really is paced out very beautifully. And I love the way it leaves just enough room for us to imagine the scene and fill in some of the gaps in our head a little bit. Super fun. All right. Tomorrow we're going to do a little bit of archaeology to learn more about what this scene might have looked like. I've got a stack of wonderful music that Jeff Foot has been pumping out for this podcast, including some extended editions of that. I mean, we try to keep it pretty short when we put fun little music at the end just because we're trying to get you out of here. We know you got stuff to do with your day, but I got a bunch of that. And from time to time, publish that music for the patrons of the program at patreon.com slash T M B H. So if you support the program and you get a kick out of the stuff that we do at the end, I'm going to be publishing a bunch of that music for you for free is a thanks for supporting here over the next few weeks. I've been gradually taking all of Jeff's music and assigning it in a way that is thematically appropriate as an individual ringtone for different people in my lives. And I think it's really funny and fun. You could do the same if you wanted to those of you who support the program through planning center, we're just going to send you an email with that stuff as well so that you get everything too. All right. That's it for now. I'm Michael our podcast.
