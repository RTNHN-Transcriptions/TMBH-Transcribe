This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Welcome back to all of you have been hanging out with me as we inch through the book of Matthew, one little chunk at a time on weekday mornings. Welcome to all of you who are here for the first time. If this is your first time, you are great jumping in right here. You're going to have fine. I think you'll figure out what we're doing pretty quickly and you will be able to catch up and catch on as we go along. If, however, you get into it and you're like, yeah, I want to start from the beginning. It's going to be a little bit of a haul, but it's going to be a fun haul. You can go back anytime you want to and catch back up or catch up and stay current or do whatever you want because it's the internet and you're in charge of the decisions you make on the internet. Whatever the case, we're in Matthew chapter 13 this time around and we're in the middle of a pair of back to back parables that are both these little micro parables in the middle of a much, much bigger thing. And so Matthew 13 once again is the third great big discourse of Jesus out of five around which Matthew has structured his account of the life and teachings of Jesus. The first one is a sermon on the mount. The second one is the missional discourse of Matthew 10. And now we get the kingdom discourse of Matthew 13. This is interesting because it is a bit of a contrast with the first one, the sermon on the mount because the sermon on the mount is an overt explanation of the values of the kingdom, what the kingdom is going to be about. And the kingdom parables discourse here in Matthew 13 is it's a lot of the same material, but it's delivered in parables. And so it's a little more cryptic and it's a little more fun to think about and wrestle with. And as you'll see today, there are a couple of points in this discourse where there really is room for disagreement. Now I got an opinion on the one we're going to look at today, but other people have opinions too. I'm going to try to do right by them in terms of what they think. So yesterday, we looked at the parable of the mustard seed. This is the one that goes, he told them another parable. The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it's the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it's the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches. This looks like it follows a very similar pattern to the other stuff we've seen in terms of the idea that the kingdom starts very small and that it duplicates itself, that it grows into something bigger. And then when it does grow into that something bigger, that there is a blessing, there's a benefit to it. There's an additional harvest, a repetition of the seeds that were planted. Or in this case, the tiny little seed is good for only being eaten by one bird quickly in the first parable of Matthew chapter 13. Here in this parable in Matthew chapter 13, that little seed grows into something that benefits a lot more people and does a lot more good. So it's not too tough to see what's going on here. The kingdom is going to start small. It's going to look unassuming and it's going to grow into a giant thing that accomplishes a ton of redemptive stuff. And it's awesome. But then the next one, there's a little bit of debate about it goes like this. He told them still another parable. The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked through all the dough. So this yeast one is similar to the mustard seed one. And they're both about something little turning into something big. But Matthew is a very carefully put together book. Jesus is a very intentional speaker. There's no way he's going to be like, I didn't really say quite what I meant to on the first one. I got no one. Let me just try this, see if it hits you a little bit better. There's a reason that both of these are here. And so the obvious interpretive question that takes us beyond the surface level, meaning of little thing growing into something big is why would Jesus say the same thing twice in a row? And we're going to assume that he didn't and that it means something different. And there's a reason that both of these are here. So with the parable of the mustard seed, we get the third straight image of the little DNA data packet of the seed duplicating itself into something bigger and more important. But with the yeast, we don't get that the data packet of the yeast is not duplicated by the process of being worked through the dough and causing that expansion is just a little bit of that yeast has the ability to permeate a much larger thing. So in a lot of ways, the parable of the yeast is a little bit more reminiscent of what Jesus said going right through the front door in Matthew chapter five at the beginning of the much more overt sermon on the Mount. Matthew 513, remember, this is the stuff that comes right on the heels of the beatitudes where Jesus says, you're the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It's no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men. You're the light of the world. A city on a hill can't be hidden. Neither do people like to lamp a put under a bowl and said they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your father in heaven. So it looks like the overt concept in the sermon on the Mount is that a little bit of kingdom value, a little bit of kingdom citizen mixed in with the larger set of world values and the larger collection of world citizens can be a very effective thing, even in very small number. It does not take one part salt to one part steak to properly season a steak. It takes very, very little salt relatively speaking. Likewise, it takes relatively little yeast to cause all of that dough to respond. But the yeast isn't duplicating itself. There's a byproduct to the yeast that causes that growth and that change and that permeation. And at this point, maybe we could stretch the parable a little bit and imagine that Jesus is talking about kingdom citizens doing kingdom citizen value things and that causing some kind of secondary good. But I'm not sure the analogy holds that far out. So given the immediate literary context of the speech and given the larger narrative context of the pressure ratcheting up on Jesus and people falling out into reject him or embrace him camps and him flipping to speaking in parables, understanding that, hey, some people are going to have their eyes open. They're going to see this. Some people are going to have their ears open. They're going to hear this and other people are going to have those two orifice he shut acknowledging all of that. My best guess is that what we're getting here is Jesus is saying, Hey, it might look like this kingdom thing just does not have the momentum necessary to change something this big. But it's only going to take a teeny, tiny little drop of kingdom stuff to have a vast transformative effect on this larger world system. There are other people who look at this and raise the objection that I think literally everywhere else in the Bible, yeast is used as a metaphor for evil or sin. This is why you've got the unleavened bread in the Old Testament feasts. This is why even in the New Testament, when you go over to 1 Corinthians 5, something to something 5, 6, where Paul is in the middle of a letter where he's just berating this church and Corinth for being crappy at stuff and awful. He uses yeast as a metaphor in a negative sense as well. He says, your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough? Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast as you really are for Christ, our Passover lamb has been sacrificed. And obviously there's a lot of context there we don't have time to go into. So some people who are way smarter and better studied than me, look at this passage and they're like, no, this is Jesus tempering expectations for people who are interested in the kingdom in terms of how good it will always be. This is him saying there's going to be some dumb stuff that happens in the kingdom. And then that fits. I mean, there are warnings that come a little bit later on about there being wolves without and wolves within. And the idea is not foreign to the authors of the New Testament, nor to Jesus, that there's going to be difficult destructive stuff that happens within the church. Now, the parable of the wheat and the tears, which brackets the parable of the mustard seed and the yeast has a story about an enemy that comes and messes with a field. And Jesus, though, specifically says that that field is the world. So if the parable of the mustard seed and the yeast are talking about corruption within the church, within the kingdom, that would not fit with what we see in the parable that brackets it on either side, that being the weed and the weeds, that is a parable about the relationship between the kingdom and the world. And likewise, the parable of the sower is a parable about the relationship between the kingdom, the message of the king, and the world and how it will be received. So it is entirely possible that the brilliant people who think that this is a tiny little parable acknowledging that the kingdom people and the church, the kingdom citizens aren't always going to get everything right, is possible they have a point here. To me, on the other hand, it looks like this is one of those places where for shock value, Jesus is flipping a metaphor that's always used to mean one thing to another thing. And we do have precedent for that in the last great discourse of Matthew in Matthew 10, 16, where it says, I'm sending you out like sheep among wolves, therefore be as shrewd as snakes. And as innocent as dubs, generally snakes are not a good thing. But Jesus drives home his point by harnessing the imagery of something that's usually viewed as destructive and repackaging it is something that is viewed as positive. He does the same thing over in the parable of the shrewd manager in the book of Luke that we do not have time to get into today. If this parable does happen to mean that there's going to be problems and flaws within the kingdom citizenry and you should not be surprised by that, it's a great parable because that's totally true and lines up with the rest of the Bible. If this parable means that a tiny bit of kingdom stuff has the potential to permeate the much larger world system, so don't despair if the thing seems very, very small right now, which I think fits a little bit better with the literary and narrative context, that would also be a great parable that also bears out in the way the rest of the text goes on to describe how the relationship between the kingdom and the world works. Next time around, we get onto Jesus explanation of the wheat and the tears. And finally, thanks to the tan or so of you that jumped in on the Patreon thing at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast, we're doing a thing right now, we're working on this cool little Matthew field notes, not Matthew like me, but like Matthew like the book of Matthew, this will field notes diary journal thing. I just thought it'd be cool to give that to everybody who's making this thing go by supporting the program. You can jot down notes or do whatever you want with it. I just, I think it's pretty neat and I'm excited to get them out to you. So working on that now, looking to get that in the mail or starting to get that in the mail here in the next couple of weeks. All right, thank you so much to all of you for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
