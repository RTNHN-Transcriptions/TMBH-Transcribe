And clearly what the jerk is doing is he's pretending to memorialize the fallen hero and to have great respect for who he was and what he stood for and he's so sad now to have to take up that mantle for himself so that he can lead in a way that is completely contradictory to how Mufasa had led in the past. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 23, that is the accusation Jesus is throwing at the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. He's saying, you guys act like you're so sad about all of the great leaders of the past who died and we're even to use the more Christian term, I guess martyred and you got these real fancy tombs that you made for him and you honor those tombs. But then Jesus pivots to say, but if you look at your actual behavior here, it's evident that that is all a sham that is all a front. You don't respect what those people stood for or understand why they died or maybe worse, you do understand the whole thing and all you're doing is trying to profit on their legacy while you do the exact opposite of what those men of God did. That's a lot of paraphrase that would have been more efficient. If I just read it, Matthew 23 29, what do you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites, you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, if we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets. So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up then the measure of the sin of your forefathers. All right, you're smart. You're socially attuned. You've been going through all of these woes with me and you can tell that each one feels a little more stout than the one before. And by the time we get to the end here, Jesus is striking at something that I think we can relate to even in this moment. He's pointing at that human proclivity to theoretically have learned the lessons of the past to shake our heads about the dumb, ignorant, bad people who came before this to tisk, tisk them for being on the wrong side of history on this issue or that issue. Or did you read this letter that this lady wrote in this year back in the day? Well, it turns out she was a monster after all, and implicit in all such ovation that we make so boldly and proudly on the internet is that if we had lived in any other age, just based on how morally exemplary we are now, we never would have thought what everyone else thought. We would have been the rare, brave visionary who had 2021 values all the way back then. And we would have seen right from wrong precisely. And we would have had a robust education. So we would have been able to stand up to literally everyone else who was wrong about everything. And we would have been a courageous beacon in the night. And so we honor those people who were victimized by the idiots who were wrong about literally everything who came before us and can only now sadly reflect on how much better the world would look if just we had been there all those years ago to lead the way and show everyone the right way to think and how the moralities actually are. It's disgusting. It's one of the worst looks we have in all of online current modern discourse right now. No, sir, you would not have been better than all the people who lived in that moment because you are swept up in the moment you're in right now just like I am because we all live in the moment. And we also all try to look at the example of people from all kinds of other moments, hopefully with empathy and try to think outside of our own moment to rise above that and do things that are good and moral and redemptive. And it just ain't easy because we're temporal beings who live in a temporal moment. If you can picture that line of rhetoric that we all see thrown around so often today, then you can read between the lines to picture the line of rhetoric that the Pharisees were clearly throwing around. They needed to demonstrate that they had a continuity, some sort of descendency from these great leaders of old and to make it clear that they were on the side of those who were wronged in the past. But then Jesus rolls into the party and he's like, no, stop with that sham. You're stupid hollow words and grave decorations about how much you admired these persecuted prophets of old ring really hollow when you look at the fact that all of your rhetoric and behavior sounds like the people you condemn and looks like the opposite of the people you lionize or to put this another way. Jesus is challenging a narrative that these guys have crafted here. They've crafted a narrative that they are the moral elite and that they would have been the moral elite in any era and that they are descended from the people who were on the right side of history, not the wrong side of history. This is a very common practice in the ancient Near East. Every Greek person for hundreds of years who wanted a claim to authority would be like, I'm descended from Hercules. I got a little bit of the blood of the old men of the gods still running through these veins. So I should be in charge of the thing. So that pedigree concept was one that I mean, it was president Judaism. Look at the beginning of Matthew chapter one. It was there. And so it's not unusual that the Pharisees and teachers of the law would try to demonstrate an intellectual pedigree hailing from desirable people of the past and then use that as a narrative to prop up their own authority. What's shocking about the passage is how aggressively Jesus attacks that narrative and flips it. You're not that you're actually the bad guys. If you'd been there, you would have been one of the ones eagerly and rapidly chucking rocks at the man of God's head. And now that he's dead and he can't say anything, it costs you nothing to say what a wonderful fallen prophet this person was. But if we agree that it looks like Jesus is attacking their narrative, what narrative is he replacing it with? What's the new story that he's putting in place? I don't think it's this that just as Jesus is the completion of the story arc of the work of God and the work of the prophets who truly represented the redemptive work of God. So the Pharisees are the completion of the ancient story arc of the enemies of God of the servants of the evil one of those who opposed the redemptive work of God of those who attacked and killed and buried the prophets. He's unmasking them like at the end of an episode of Scooby-Doo. He's doing the twist reveal at the end of an action show where you discovered the person you thought was your most important ally all along was actually the villain and the one behind all the problems sabotaging things all along. And then he spikes the football at the end of this redefining of the narrative by saying basically lean into it suckers. You wear that albatross around your neck. That is who you are. Fill up then the measure of the sin of your forefathers. In other words, you own it. They own it. They started things. They filled the bucket of that story of resistance to God part way, but you're the ones who are topping it off right now. So go ahead and what you're going to do. Do quickly. The Pharisees spun up a story that said we are the continuation and the modern day example of these brave, courageous anti-establishment vouch for God prophets who we just love and take such inspiration from. Jesus says, no, look at your words and actions. No, that's not the narrative at all. The actual narrative is you are a part of a long line of bad guys who resisted God and killed the people who stood up for what was true and right. And you're continuing to do so right now. You want social credits. You say you honor those prophets who your forefathers killed and who you would have helped kill if you had been there, but you don't listen to their message. You Pharisees and teachers of the law then bear the guilt of the previous generations who rejected God and his prophets. This is not an easy chunk of Bible in this confrontation. Though I try to make it fun is not fun. It's difficult to hear this level of judgment issued by one who has such authority. I do not revel in this. I do not think I'm better or should pat my back because I never would have done it. No, I've said before and I will say again, this condemnation is probably rightly directed at me because I think I would have been on the wrong side of this genuinely. I do. So this hurts. It stings. It gets through my armor and also I can just send a minute ago. It's in the Bible and we're doing the whole book of Matthew. So we're spending time on it. We're spending more time on it tomorrow. Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
