It's the book of Nehemiah. I think we all have a weird love-hate relationship with crowds and crowdedness. The love part for me is real easy. I mean, there's a vibe when a lot of people are around. It's a great sporting event or music or the food truck thing that we have in our town. I like to go to the food truck thing, even though it's real crowded and you had to wait longer for your food. This is fun because there's so many people there and they're all different. Everybody's bringing their own entrepreneurial skill set and their cooking skills out and putting them on display and all the smells are competing for your attention because you can't eat from all the food trucks. It's kind of a metaphor. I like the metaphor that the food truck alley is for all of us living together in society. We might not see all the ways that everybody else is contributing to this beautiful, amazing moment that we live in, but the fact that there's so many people on Earth and that we share the world with so many people in our community, with so many people is a huge part of the reason that things are overwhelmingly great. I know there's always stuff to complain about, but I mean, come on, look around. Things are overwhelmingly great in this moment in history, and it's fun to imagine like, oh, I would go trade places with this moment in history or that moment in history. I think you get sick of it in like a week and really, really, really wish for hot showers again and modern medicine. The electricity is pretty cool. I guess GPS is nice. Freedom of movement airplanes, even though it's not the most fun, it's pretty handy. So, I mean, we like crowds, right? Because of the vibe and because other people contribute things to our lives that are good, even if we don't notice it all the time, it's there. Also, we'd be lying if we didn't admit that sometimes we just wish everybody would go away and that the Earth would revert to like 10% of its current population. So we could live in harmony with nature because I think we imagine that's how things used to be, maybe somewhere possibly once. And it happens when you're in dumb crowds, like stupid traffic, not traffic you can understand where it's like, well, there's just a lot of people, but dumb traffic where it's like, we don't have to have this traffic. It's because of that lady and those two dudes right there who don't understand how to operate a motor vehicle and now we have to have traffic or airports. Airports will do it again. I said, I like airplanes. They're great, but sometimes it's just, you know, all kinds of dumb red tape hurdles that you got to go through there and then you can start to feel that sort of hunched shoulder posture. Like I think especially dads all develop at some point in life that gremlin badger posture. Oh, there's too many people. I want to retreat to the woods and make my own colony of a small select few people who I like and never be bothered by modern society again, but you can't really have the one without the other, right? Everybody's contributing to everybody. There's synergy between all of us. We're all connected. But also sometimes maybe we're just a little too connected and it can be easy to feel real grumpy about that. And when you're in a societal moment or an individual moment where you sort of want to retreat to the woods and you don't want to live in the middle of things anymore because you're sort of crowded out, well, then all of a sudden the city, the middle of things seems really unappealing. And likewise, that seems to have been the situation in 444 BC with the repopulation of Jerusalem. And the rebuilding of the walls for a whole variety of reasons. Nobody wanted to crowd into the walled part of the city that they just got done walling off under the leadership of Nehemiah. So it's a really cool accomplishment, right? The descendants of Abraham built a new temple, a couple of generations earlier in the late 500s BC. That's great. Then they staved off genocide, a generation earlier during the reign of Xerxes and Esther. And then here in Nehemiah, just now, I mean, the whole of Jerusalem is in peril. The walls are broken down, the people are in disarray. But then a hero from the east arrives in Nehemiah and is like, your problem is now my problem. And we're just going to solve this. No red tape, no stupid stuff. Go. Whoa. And in just a few weeks, more or less everything is fixed. And you have a walled city and everything's ready to go. Jerusalem is back on its feet. That's amazing. Everybody wants to live there. Why? Oh, it's not fashionable to live in Jerusalem. There aren't a lot of people living outside of Jerusalem. So it's a good time to go and make an estate or a villa. These types of dwellings were becoming very popular in this part of the world during this era of achaemenid Persia, really because it had been so cleaned out a few years earlier. Now there's all the opportunity in the world to kind of go carve that land up again, like an Oklahoma land rush kind of situation. And so people wanted to be in the suburbs. They wanted to be on the hillsides and in the country. And maybe if you're 17 or 18 years old right now, as you're listening to this, or maybe if you can remember what it was like to be a kid and kind of tugging at the leash of your small town and imagining how sexy and interesting and dynamic it would be to go live in the big city. Maybe in that context, it's kind of hard to relate to the people of Jerusalem like, why wouldn't you want to go live in the cool bright light city? But it just wasn't hot at this point. It wasn't popular. It wasn't where people's heads were at. They wanted to go into town, do a little business a couple of days a week. They wanted to go into town to do what they needed to do at the temple and they didn't want Jerusalem to get destroyed. But it looks like nobody really wanted to live there. Instead, they wanted to escape the crowds, maybe even beat the heat. They wanted to build an acreage and an estate for themselves. So unlike Rome, which is starting to really pick up steam way out West, unknown to any other people here in Nehemiah, unlike Rome where people were starting to move inward toward the city center in the middle of the seven hills of Rome and it was becoming financially beneficial in Rome at this time to be really close to the marketplaces and really involved in the politics. Here, it was kind of better to be farther away from the politics. You didn't really need to be close to the marketplaces. Persia was pretty stable. Everybody was doing pretty well. Move out to the country. Avoid the crowds. Well, Nehemiah is smart and he knows that's not going to work. He knows that people are going to have to overcome their aversion to the crowds. They're going to have to overcome the stigma of living in the rundown old city of Jerusalem, which just hasn't been the place to be for a long time and fill this thing up and make it thrive culturally in the hopes that there could be a whole robust, multifaceted economy here to go along with the one thing that's kind of doing all the heavy lifting right now economically, which is the religious stuff. Nehemiah clearly wants the leaders of these households to have a presence in Jerusalem and it's like anything else, wherever the people are, whatever is valued, whatever as eyeballs on it, that's going to be protected. That's going to be preserved. So Nehemiah knows that there's another hurdle here. There's another threat to the people and that is you can build a cool place for everybody to live. But if they don't want to move in there, it's not going to work. You know, go and look at the cities in China that they master planned and designed out in the provinces that look real cool. But again, nobody wants to be there. So they're just kind of big and empty ghost towns wild. So what's Nehemiah going to do? Well, he's going to tell people, dang it, you're going to move into the cities, particularly into Jerusalem and we're going to do life there and we are going to be at least a semi-urban people, because that's the way society and history is headed. And we're going to have to do that if we want to preserve this thing we've built. Nehemiah 11-1, we just got done with a whole list of covenant responsibilities. Everybody just got done agreeing. All the people who ratified that, they just got done agreeing. We will not neglect the house of our God. And now Nehemiah 11-1. Now the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every 10 to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the remaining nine were to stay in their own towns. Dang, you have to do a lottery where if you get this short straw, the losers of the lottery have to move to newly rebuilt Jerusalem. That tells you what you need to know, right? That nobody wanted to do it unless they were forced to do it. And in the spirit of Nehemiah 10 and Nehemiah 9, it's something they're willing to do. We will effectively tithe one male member of our household, one generation of our household, one of our sons to go and build a new urban extension of our household within the walls of Jerusalem. But nobody's going to volunteer to do it. So we're going to have to draw lots and one out of every 10 is just going to be forced to go and do it while the other nine get to stay put where they want. Where do they want to stay put? Well, a whole lot of people just wanted to be in the orbit of Jerusalem at this time. Here's we're trying to reestablish the ancient inheritance of different parts of Judea and Israel that had been assigned all the way back in the end of the book of Joshua after the conquest when all the different land got distributed to all the different families. Now they're trying to make this historic connection as well. And I think pretty clearly Nehemiah and Ezra, I mean, they're into that kind of stuff. So I think pretty clearly they're trying to support this effort for people to go and put their historic roots back down in their historic familial ancestral homes. But at the same time, hey, facts are facts, guys, we got to fill up Jerusalem or somebody else is going to fill up Jerusalem. If we don't put a whole ton of Jews in this city, somebody else is going to reap all the benefits of our labor and our hard work and the blessings of God. And these blessings aren't first and foremost for them. These blessings are meant to uphold the life of the temple and the role that the descendants of Abraham, I biblically believed that they play to be a blessing to all the nations that is all the nations are to be blessed through them. So we got to fill up Jerusalem. That's how we're going to do it. Send us one in 10 and they're going to set up a little extension of your family's household. They're going to make a new miniature ancestral home for your family here in Jerusalem. They were at a moment where the public impulse as can happen in the individual life view or me as well was toward go retreat to the wilderness, go be away from the crowds. And so they had to again make provisions for how to see to it that what they were accomplishing here was sustainable and that meant making provisions for people going against the cultural impulse of the day to go and set up shop in the city. Probably we're going to cover all the rest of chapter 11 tomorrow, which means if you're doing the math on this thing, you're like, wait, okay, we're going to get all of 11 tomorrow. Yeah, we are. And then 12 man, what is that going to take a day? A couple days as well. No, there's a procession in there that we need to talk about the rededication of the wall. 12 might take a few days and then 13 takes us way out to some big picture stuff. And then we're going to use the final chapter of the book of Nehemiah to kind of land the plane on the big themes. And then we'll talk for a couple days about what happened after and just sort of put a bow on this whole era. And then we're into Galatians. So I got a couple of things I want to ask you. One, would you go and do the Galatian series with me next? I would be so grateful if we could do another one together. I know it's a big commitment. Every time you jump into something like this with me, I just don't want to take you for granted because you have other things to do and lots of people make really good podcasts and media. And so there's a billion things you could go and listen to. And I would just like to ask over the next few days as we round out Nehemiah, if you would consider going and doing the Galatians thing with me, I would be honored. I love doing this. Thank you for considering it. If you decide that that is something you're up for, I have an even more aggressive ask. Would you consider inviting somebody to be a part of it? Maybe make it a thing you have a conversation about over lunch or coffee once a week or something like that. I'm already throwing a bunch of energy and effort at Galatians. We don't really take a break. So as soon as we're done with Nehemiah, the next day, we will be into the book of Galatians. And I'm pretty excited about it, but I'm also pretty excited to finish well what we've been working on for quite a while here in this whole Persian era of the Bible that is about to come to an end. Cool. That's plenty for today. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
