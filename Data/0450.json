and and that's the ten minute by our podcast that beloved line is from the three amigos with martin short chevy chase and steve martin and i totally remember it because i heard people quoted i still haven't actually seen a movie because of the kind of movie that you were totally not allowed to see when i was a child and even the fact that the denver broncos had three receivers in the nineteen eighties reiki natoville and johnson and mark jackson i believe who went by the nickname the three amigos and even though i begged my parents that telling them that it would help me better understand relevant football analogies and make me fit in better with my friends are one of the friends school my parents are still like no you can't see it and i just never got around to seeing it but i have seen that clip and in that clip the three amigos are gonna go face certain death in this little kid in mexico walks up is like hey and we're going to die and everything to get the watch and it's really cute and it's really charming and i should probably watch that movie at some point so i can fit in with all of you and you can like me more and we can be friends and you can think i'm cool but the joke is very obviously that the kid understands what's coming up it's not like he doesn't understand that they're about to get shot and die this city's really interested in that watch and can't help himself but to ask for it likewise in matthew chapter twenty we have been having jesus talk more and more about the fact that he is going to die soon and the first time it comes up which is back in matthew sixteen he doesn't even actually say anything on screen matthew the narrator just tells us that he started telling the disciples that he is going to be killed and that he was going to come back to life on the third day but then in chapter seventeen two different times he gives increasing amounts of detail being like hey i'm like any guys are worried about a lot of different things or whatever but i'm going to die and then on the third day i'm going to be raised back to life and then big time in chapter twenty verses eighteen and nineteen he spells out like no i'm really going to die and it's going to be super violent and pretty much everybody's going to be in on it's going to be the jews the romans i'm going to be rejected by everybody i'm going to get flogged flogging is in my future my near future that's going to happen people are going to mock me and make fun of me and then i'm going to get crucified is to hung up on a tree to bleed out and die and be asphyxiated in front of everybody mostly naked it's going to be a shameful horrible awful death and that's about to happen and then as if that wasn't incredible enough he goes on to be like yeah not like that but then on the third day i'm going to come back to life and then according to verse twenty the immediate response in the text after this shocking revelation that is not only dramatic and terrible and horrifying but also promises to break the laws of time and space the immediate response to that is as follows then the mother of zebedee's sons came to jesus with her sons and kneeling down asked a favor of him what is it you want he asked she said grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other may sit at your left in the kingdom you don't know what you're asking jesus said to them can you drink the cup i'm going to drink oh we we can they answered jesus said to them you'll indeed drink from my cup but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant these places belong to those for whom they've been prepared by my father i'm about to do that thing again where i'm like on the one hand it's like this but on the other hand it's like this so let's just do that on the one hand come on it's a mom and she loves her kids and she super wants things to work out great for them and she can tell just because of her social acuity that people are starting to jockey a little bit for position here they're starting to believe that jesus is going to die that he's going to die soon and she really doesn't want her kids to get dealt out of the deal i mean they are the fanciest kids in the entire disciple club they've been very committed they gave up a lot i mean for crying out loud she joined in too so like it's a whole family thing and jesus likes them and so she's gonna play the card right here and come to him and be like hey i know you got a soft spot for moms because i remember the time when you were at that wedding in cana and your mom came up she's like oh they're out of wine do something and you're like okay dokie watch this remember you did that for her so i understand that you get it well i'm a mom and i love my kids and what wouldn't a mother do for their kids and i couldn't help but over here you saying some stuff about how you're gonna get plugged and then get hung up on a giant chunk of wood and i and i just figured now is probably the time to jump in and politely ask if maybe you know just such a came up but just don't mind i mean just a small one little trivial tiny little things could my two sons rule in all of eternity over the entire galaxy with you forever seated at your right and left hand dominating everything and thwarting all rivals and crushing all resistance and perfect purity and holiness exalted to a godlike status for all of time forever just do me could you do that maybe please so we're still on the one hand here and i just got to say i get it moms are awesome they're great they go to bat for their kids i understand that most of you listening to this right now are my mom who's just bought dozens upon dozens of electronic devices so that she can stream my internet content and make me feel like this is working and people listen and enjoy it so i'm a big time fan of moms and i understand why she's doing this and i even think in light of the fact that nobody at this point really totally understood what jesus was talking about her doing we just got to cut her a little bit of slack and be like hey she was momming she was mom and hard she was advocating for her kid's nice job on the other hand the she did just hear him say that i'm going to get killed and it's going to be horrible knowing that he was going to get killed is what prompted her to turn right around and try to quickly get to the front of the line and get this position for her kids so props to her for being a great mom and believing in her boys and also kind of not props to her for being sort of ruthless like i said she's a person where people people have problems we see things imperfectly and incomplete but it makes for some kind of comical bible here that she comes with this question but interestingly jesus who just keeps getting lobbed two people out softballs for like the last three chapters people come up and they keep saying really relatively dumb and salting things that you would think you'd really push back on but he just keeps not he's in a very patient place in all of this ministry at this point he just calmly says you don't know what you're asking can you drink the cup i'm going to drink and i'm just tickled by the fact that james and john the sons of thunder that was the name that they had been given these brash confident two young men are like oh yeah why me what cup are you drinking yeah i mean it doesn't matter what cup trust me we can drink from that cup too it's absolutely fine yeah we can drink it we're in we're good and what is jesus just been explaining to them i mean what is all of this about he's going to consume death and be subjected to death so that he can defeat death and bring about and initiate this redemptive kingdom this is greater truer reality for all of everything in this transcendent sense in this all-encompassing sense of what it is to drink from this cup like these guys just can't do it and they don't understand it yet in the narrower sense of what it is to drink from this cup that being to drink from the cup of death if you will of voluntarily laying down your life for this thing well in that sense yeah i suppose they could drink from that cup of the martyrdom of laying down their life and indeed one of the two james will he'll be the first of the disciples to be martyred that's recorded not too far down the road here just a few pages over here in act chapter 12 it says it was about this time that king harret arrested some who belong to the church intending to persecute them he had james the brother of john put to death with the sword and and that's it that's all luke gives us in act chapter 12 it's just this quick yep that guy did drink of that cup after all i guess it's just so fast and so passing now steven had been martyred before this but again james was the first of the disciples to be put to this order put to death so it's interesting that he jumps right in it's like oh yeah we can do that because james is the first and john is the only one of the 12 who isn't martyred i mean i don't know what you really do with jude's however you count jude's i mean he died over the whole thing in kind of a different context so james is the first to go john is never martyred and lives out his life all the way so there's some irony there to the way this whole thing plays out regarding them saying that they can indeed drink from the cup and jesus affirms it says you will drink from my cup but you can't sit at my right or my left and it's interesting that he defers on this it's just not mind-to-grant i'm not the decider of these things so he is subservient entirely he's demonstrating it once again to the plan of the father he agreed to the plan he's fully participatory in the plan but the father has his hands on the wheel of the plan and jesus says these places belong to those for whom they've been prepared by my father so who are those people who does end up sitting at the left and right hand of the father i don't think we really get a neat tidy answer to that it feels like they're asking the wrong question and they're not understanding how this whole thing is going to break out anyway but to their credit they're picturing him as a king and they're imagining what an authority structure and what a king would look like in the environments and the context that they're used to seeing it in in summary i think it's pretty easy to criticize the disciples when they do stupid crap and they do from time to time but i don't know i'm trying to make a habit of gleaning what needs to be gleaned from whatever they goofed up and learning from it and then cutting them some slack and getting on with it because i don't think i even would have followed jesus if i was there i mean it's fun to imagine that i would have been one of the ones was like oh yeah i see it i get it i'm going to be an early adopter but probably i wouldn't have been statistically it's not likely that i would have been i probably would have been one of the people who had done a really good job in his mind of constructing all of the defenses and good arguments for why the version of religion that we were doing makes the most sense and i i would have probably dug in really hard on that and i would have had a difficult time understanding or tracking with what was going on here and so yeah i think these guys deserve credit and i think it's dumb anytime that i even hinted me being somehow better or smarter than them that's that stupid i'm definitely not so these two dudes and their mom they don't get their request answered the way they wanted and it looks like probably nobody sits at the right and left hand of the triune god i just don't think that's how it works but there's some faith mixed in there with some weird selfishness and i'm super empathetic to that because that sounds a lot like me all right thanks for thinking about this one with me i'm at the ten minute bible hour
