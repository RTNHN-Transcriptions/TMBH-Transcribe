We went on a trip there with our family a few weeks ago, a Christmas magic trip. It was great. It was the last minute thing. We had another trip planned and it all fell through because of sickness at the last minute and then we got healthy. We were like, okay, where's the cheapest place in the world to go that's interesting? And it just happened to be my favorite place in the world to go that's interesting. It's Italy. I love Italy. I've tried to learn Italian. I've kind of spoken Italian at a couple points in my life. I don't have any sense that because I visited there a lot, I somehow have any purchase on the place. I just like it. I like the people. I like the history. I like the culture. It's just a magical place. And I love to go there whenever I can and learn things and go and look at the places that I like to study and all of that business. And the feeling of wonder that I had the first time I went there and I wrote on the little blue line subway train and we came up out of the subway station and I'm trying to adjust my eyes and everything as I walked toward the big arch that takes you back out into the great wide world from the underground and boom, what do I see? The Colosseum just filling up that whole entryway. It was amazing in the background. There's the arch of Constantine over there's the arch of Titus and the forum somewhere over there. Julius Caesar got stabbed at death. It is just it's so in my wheelhouse. So coolest thing ever. And I felt this great sense of wonder the first time I went there. Well, you'd never get that feeling again. But if you want something like it, you take people you care about, you take people you love. And I've had the chance to do that a whole bunch and go explore with a whole bunch of different people who really mean a lot to me and watch them unwrap the present of Italy and Rome and all the history and everything. So I wanted that for my kids. That's why we took the trip. I think they got that experience. But unfortunately, we also got this other life lesson about traveling and being an obvious outsider. No matter how much we try to not look like an obvious outsider, we did look like obvious outsiders. Clearly somebody marked us on a crowded subway train. They acted like they didn't know each other. It was a very clever heist. And we all packed into the train. I had my head on a swivel and I noticed that there were three people, a dude and separately, two ladies who it would have made more sense for them to board the train several doors down. But they right when the doors open, they made a beeline up to the door that we were picking. And there's just this crush of people and we get jammed into the train and everything. And I've got the girls who are both in high school and a bunch of people pack in and we get a little bit separated, I think intentionally from Camilla and my son, who's 13 right now. And there was a guy on the train speaking Italian and also a little bit of English. And he was way too friendly and compassionate toward Camilla and my son, which sounds weird. I mean, it's Rome. The people are kind. They're good people. But they see tourists all day, every day, they're trying to do life and do things. But they're not just going to try to make great pals with, Hey, there's some tourists on the train, we should become great friends. I think Americans maybe do that a little bit. We're sort of oddly friendly and eager to share or whatever. But it's just it just doesn't make sense. And so it was weird that the guy was being this friendly. And also that while being friendly, it seemed like he was intentionally wedging in a way such that he would separate Camilla from our son. And I could see the mom instincts kicked in, she's doing the right thing. And there's other two ladies who acted like they were kind of fighting as they were getting onto the train. That was very distracting. I was like, wait, you're acting like you don't know each other, but you were together in the station. You do know each other. Something's happening here. This is weird. But at the same time, there's a crush and we're getting pushed away from each other so much that like my wife, I was very distracted by just keeping track of the family. And somewhere in there, they grabbed her phone and their cards and their and stuff. And yeah, they went and swiped cards and whatever. Like no harm, no foul. We caught it. It's sad and embarrassing. And I could just not it's not a good feeling to get robbed, obviously, but also, yeah, whatever. We figured it out. And the kids got a great lesson. Again, I guess I started to say this a minute ago about travel and how we can tell when people are tourists or guests to our part of the world when they come to visit the Black Hills. So even more so when we're overseas, people can tell we kind of don't belong there. Most people would view that with either indifference or a little bit of compassion to be like, hey, let's just kind of keep an eye out for these people. They clearly aren't savvy about what's going on here. Some people will be predatory in that environment. This is a very long way of me getting to where I wanted to get to. But I think I just wanted to tell you the story of the pickpocketing a little bit. So thank you for hearing me on that. It's kind of like a wild thing. We just I mean, we hardly ever get pick pocketed. So it's kind of a big deal. Thanks for listening. In the book of Ezra in chapter eight, there is this same age old concern. You're going to be out of your element. You're going to have some resources. You're going to have a target on your back. Some people are probably going to be good to you as travelers. That is toward Ezra and this big caravan of people who's taken as returning exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon. But it only really takes one individual or group of people to look at you and say, yeah, you're an easy mark. And all of a sudden your trip is ruined. Maybe some of your party are dead. And Ezra is rightly concerned about that. And he expresses this in very human language, starting in around verse 22 of Ezra eight. And I feel super connected to him because he has the same concern. He's got the same pressures or similar pressures to what I felt as a dad in Italy, just a couple of weeks ago. In verse 21, they stop at this canal and they're rounding up some more people to go and serve in the temple. But also he proclaims a fast so that, quote, we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children with all our possessions. Okay, again, very, very relatable to me. And probably there at the end of 21, people were like, well, what do you mean, Ezra? Because I mean, like, obviously, we're not going to take a trip like this with all this gold and silver and everything without a military escort. Right. And at this point, I kind of pictured the Anakin and Padme Star Wars episode two meme, where then Padme looks at him again after he doesn't answer that question and is like, surely we're going to have a military escort to Jerusalem because of all of our gold and silver and stuff. Right. And you just, Anakin's like, yeah, so about that. Ezra's like, so, yeah, so about that. No, there isn't going to be, he explains why verse 22, I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, quote, the gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him. So what, hold on. So you declined a military escort to protect all the kings, you pushed all our chips in a way literally to the middle of the table, saying that God will protect us. Now, if I'm in the company here, I would raise some questions with Ezra. And I think they'd be reasonable questions like, did God prophetically reveal to you that we would not undergo any harm on this trip that we wouldn't get pickpocketed or killed or robbed or whatever. And I think if Ezra were being honest, he would have to answer my question with, no, no, there's nothing like that. I know there's no prophecy or anything. I didn't know. I don't have any direct promise from God where he verbally said that he would use the angels or miracles or something to keep us from getting robbed. No, now we don't got anything like that. And then I would probably want to ask Ezra. So the plan for not getting robbed is hope we don't get robbed. Yeah. Yeah, that's more or less it. I guess. And if I'm Ezra, my smartest reply, I think would be, look, I'm just looking at everything here guys, big picture wise. I'm looking at Cyrus defeating Nebuchadnezzar, becoming king, just like Isaiah the prophet promised. I'm looking at him sending Zerubbabel and everybody back to rebuild. I'm looking at Darius finding that letter. Guys, what are the odds of that happening? That he found that letter wasn't even in Susu. It was in Ekbatana way up north. Somebody found that letter, that decree of Cyrus, after all those years up there, what are the odds guys? And then Darius, because of the way he came to power, I mean, let's not say it too loud. We don't want to get in trouble here, but because of the way he came to power by the providence of God, he doesn't want to part ways with the rulings and edicts of Cyrus. So he gives us even more to try to demonstrate how in line with Cyrus he is. And then you remember the whole bester and Mordecai thing? How many things had to work out just exactly the right way? How many opportunities were there for that to go horribly? And all of us did not even be standing here talking right now next to the Hava Canal, wherever that is. I mean, we should all be dead. The odds of that working out when Heyman wanted to kill us. I mean, there was no chance. And everything just worked out. I mean, the king just couldn't sleep on one night. And he just happened to open the chronicles to that one page and see that one detail that flipped the whole story guys. That's crazy. So no, I don't have a prophecy here that says this the way it's going to work out. But I'm just reading the big picture of all those things I said. And if the letter we just got from Artaxerxes feels to me like God is behind all of this. And it felt like I would kind of ruin it and be duplicating the mistakes of our ancestors who depended on treaties and swords and shady alliances with powerful kings of questionable integrity. It just felt like I'd be making all those mistakes again and taking us right back down the same road toward the same bigger snowballing mistakes that came in the past. If I did that, so I just told him no, just told him we wouldn't wouldn't need any soldiers wouldn't need anything. Don't worry. It's all going to get there safely. And then if I'm the guys who aren't real sure about what Ezra's doing here and his leadership decisions, I'd be like, do you really believe that? Like really, truly deeply you genuinely think that there's a big thing that's been going on here for 80 years and that we're a part of it and that we're going to make this trip with the amount of money that we're carrying. And if I'm Ezra, I look him dead deep in the eye and I say, yeah, I really do believe that. And then if I'm the guys questioning him, I guess I say, all right, I believe in you, I believe in the God you serve or I wouldn't be on this trip. Let's do it. Now, the reason I think I would give that hypothetical answer in this scenario is one, because it really does look like something very amazing is happening here. It really does look like the hand of God is on all of this. But two, I don't have a ton of alternatives at this point. I'm committed. I have burned the ships and I am on this trip and I'm going. This Ezra guy keeps records. If I don't go, he's probably going to write down that Matt Whitman totally pansied out at the Ahava Canal and was like, wait, you're not bringing soldiers. I quit. Let that be a pox upon his household forever. I think this was the kind of thing where once you signed up, you were in. And so the game plan, when these concerns are made public is listed out here in verse 23 in this whirlwind. So we fasted and petitioned our God about this and he answered our prayer. Well, I'm all kinds of curious about what this answered our prayer thing looked like, because we weren't able to successfully complete one train ride in the subway in Rome without bandits falling upon us and robbing our phone and taking away our credit cards. And if my math is correct, it looks like Ezra and his big target on their back Jewish caravan group. It looks like they're carrying maybe hundreds of millions of dollars in precious metal. And I think that's going to stick out like more of a sore thumb than that pink cell phone my wife had that got stolen from her. So I'm very interested to see how all of this plays out. And that's what we're going to talk about next time around. My wife is a brilliant, awesome person. Sometimes people who want to take advantage of people can even get over on brilliant, awesome people. And so I'm sorry that that happened to her, but I continue to think that she's brilliant and awesome. And you know what, pickpocket guy, I bet you don't listen to this program. But if you do, I think you're kind of a jerk and you shouldn't have done that. And that's just what I think about that. You should be nicer to my wife. All right, that's all my stuff.
