It is weird. It's very outsized the effect that this movie has had and its ability to linger with me considering I think I've only seen it once when I was a kid in theaters with my family whenever it came out in the late 80s. The movie in question here is an animated film not by Disney called an American tale. It's about a family of mice who immigrate to the United States and they get separated and it made such an impression on me that I remember even the little kid mouse name who got separated. His name was Fival. You know what I think you remember the last name is the Mousekovich. The Mousekovich family. I think Fival Mousekovich. That sounds right. This story moved me. It worked on me when I was a kid. It works on me now even as I think about it because in the beginning of the movie you see how great it is when they're all together. Then when they get separated you're like I want that back. I want that for them and I want that for me. I want that to feel like things are right in the universe and so you really got stakes. You got something to root for. Maybe it wouldn't make as great an impression on me if I saw it again now. Maybe I would love it even more if I saw it again now since now I'm seeing it through the lenses of a dad and then not through the lenses of a kid. Whatever the case I think there's a reason that those kind of separation and reunification stories resonate with us. I think the reason is because that story is etched into the spirit, the psyche, the heart of all of humankind. Part of that is just because of death. Death feels weird. It feels really strange that in just one breath and one moment and one heartbeat something as profound as a life as a person with other dreams and memories and ideas and love and all that goes into that could just go away and that's it. That brokenness of that imperfect fellowship we feel with other people. It gives us this hint. It tells us there's something more to this than just mammals that live and die. That's one reason that I think a story like an American tale, the separation of reunification stories stick with us. Another reason is because I think it is the grand story. The grand story of human turmoil and stakes and what we're going through is a story of separation and reunification. That's the story is outlined in the Bible which if you really look closely at it the Bible covers a period of time beginning in before things existed and ending in after time as we know it constructed and measure it has passed on to something else. So it covers everything and the story of everything starts with unbroken fellowship between God and humanity and it's really good. We get this little taste of what it's like to be in this garden, this paradise and this place where it's hard to imagine anything better ever but then we feel the tragedy as that presence of God with humanity is broken. It's separated by the introduction of sin and failure and death into the system and then as we've discussed so many times just a few chapters into the Bible we're met with the big pivot point in the whole history of everything and that is will God begin the reunification process or as we often call it as you and I hang out here and talk the redemptive plan. Now where would it be if you watched the first 15 minutes of American tale and Fable gets lost and his family is like well where mice will just make more. Wait what? That's the end of the movie roll the credits. Nobody would like that movie very much but obviously the moment where the family chooses not to give up. I mean obviously when you kid back is you know sets the whole thing in motion. Same thing with the Bible. God chooses a redemptive arc, a plan that takes us toward reconciliation and then a whole lot of things happen in the Bible and that can get really disorienting for us because there are so many plot threads and narrative things but if we boil it all down it comes back to this. God's redemptive plan. He's putting back together a broken relationship. Jesus gives us a whole bunch of parables about this right about seeking and saving the lost and all of this business and he's not just making that up at a thin air that is the through line of everything that we see in the Bible. So even though the tangible fellowship between God and man is profoundly disrupted by the events at the garden God is still present throughout the Old Testament. Genesis and on into Exodus we see God being present in very subtle ways but we also see God breaking the laws of time and space to be very present in tangible ways that hint at the restoration of this relationship in a tangible way down the road. God shows up as fire in a burning bush. I suppose that's his presence. I suppose even the Passover is indicative of his presence in a terrifying way and then the events of the Exodus itself, well God shows up in dramatic physical manifestations to protect and guide his people as we get out into the desert and to Sinai. We get stuff in the book of Exodus describing God's glory showing up and being present and visible and tangible with his people. It's not a garden. He's still in the desert on the Sinai Peninsula. Then he's not just walking around looking like you made in his image. It's different but he's there and so we're reminded that the presence of God and union with God is still the goal of all of this stuff but then as you move out into the desert through the rest of Exodus and into a lot of the narrative that is encapsulated in the book of Numbers, we see that God apparently is going to be present with these descendants of Abraham who are being led by Moses in still a very tangible way and they get told to make a tent. God's going to live in the tent and then God's presence, his glory shows up in the tent. The language is kind of tough on this stuff. Sometimes there's really vivid descriptions about it looked like smoke. It was fire. Fire consumed a thing. Every time it just says the glory of the Lord was there and you don't really get a picture of what it would have been like to see it or feel it or experience it but the language of the text gives you a clear sense that you knew that God was present in a very real way even in those times when you couldn't really see it. Well, the Spirit of God in the book of Numbers, I think Numbers 11 is where we first see that. I don't know that off the top of my head. I was looking through this beforehand. I'm not going to dig all the way through it. I think it's Numbers 11. Is it? Now I'm looking. Nope, I was wrong. It's Numbers 10. Here we go, verse 33. So they, the Hebrews, set out from the mountain of the Lord and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest. The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp. Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, rise up, O Lord, may your enemies be scattered. May your foes flee before you. And whenever it came to rest, he said, return, O Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel. So we're seeing this slightly ambiguous relationship kind of spelled out here. There's something tangible about God's presence, but also the idea is that God's presence goes out among the people of Israel as well when they set up shop. And this is very important for how this whole presence of the Lord thing plays out throughout the rest of the Old Testament. We know that he's around this ark of the covenant. We know the ark of the covenant, the presence of God is associated with this portable temple, this portable dwelling place where the tangible presence of God exists with them. Even if that tangible presence doesn't look like a dude or however God looked when he was in the garden. Well, it's a long journey, but eventually these people get set up. They have a kingdom and David's son Solomon builds a temple for God to dwell in. God confirmed that this would happen with David as well. And then in second chronicles, seven and first Kings eight, it's two accounts of the same thing. We see that there's this big elaborate dedication of this huge temple that Solomon makes and God shows up and confirms like, yeah, this is a go. All right, I'm in. And there's the visible presence of God, the fire of the presence of God consumes offerings. I think we get that specifically spelled out in the second chronicles account. And there are rules put in place. You can't just go into that temple once the presence of God is in there. In the same way that back in the day, Moses encountered the glory of God and then had to wear a veil because nobody could even look at the leftovers of the glory of God that might still be bouncing off of Moses face. So you certainly can't just go into where he lives and you'll die. You got to tell your rope around the guy who goes in there once a year to perform a certain sacrifice. If he does something wrong and dies in the presence of the Lord, you can't go get that body out. You can drag him out by the rope. And this is how things functioned for 500 years. God dwells in that temple or specifically in the innermost part of that temple. And there's something attached to the arc of the covenant, the symbol of the deal between God and his chosen people. And for a while, the Philistines have the arc of the covenant and they couldn't be around the glory of God in that way either. So then it is a very troubling thing in 586 BC when Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians come along and destroy the temple. Now Ezekiel, the prophet in, well, this kind of covers chapters 10 and 11. He has a vision of the glory of God departing the temple. But also in the book of the prophet Ezekiel, the presence of the Lord appears to Ezekiel while he is in exile in Babylon. Babylon is not real close to Jerusalem. If you recall when we laid one map over the other, that's like the distance between Wichita, Kansas and Louisville, Kentucky. So what's God doing? Clare over in Louisville, Kentucky is supposed to be in Wichita, Kansas. Well, the prophet Joel clarifies that a bit further later on saying that ultimately God's spirit is going to dwell among all of his people, like the way it would spread out at night back there in numbers when they would set the arc down and God's spirit would be amongst all his people, not just a cloud guiding them. So Joel has this forward looking vision that we haven't seen the final form of God's presence with his people yet. Let's go back to the 6th century BC and what happened after Nebuchadnezzar. Well, now there's no second temple. Where is God? He's out there. He's doing stuff. It looks like he's with his people from time to time. His presence isn't tangible the way it was in earlier times we've looked at and then enter the Persians. They defeat the Babylonians in 538 Cyrus the Great says to the Jews, you can go back and rebuild. Zerubbabel goes back and leads the way in all of that. And after a whole bunch of delays and after the passage of two or three kings, depending on how you count it, early on in the reign of Darius the first, the great in the late 520s BC, the work is resumed on the temple and in 516 BC March 12th, I looked it up, 516 BC, the temple is completed, the temple is dedicated and that takes us back to where we've been in Ezra chapter 6. Why on earth would I not have just had my Bible open to that? I mean, what else am I doing with this thing right now? I don't remember. I was in numbers for a minute. I got to cut myself a little bit of slack. So the big question is, what are we going to get here in terms of the presence of God? Is he going to show back up the way he did before or are we not going to encounter him? And I'm just telling you right now, this episode is going to be a little bit longer because we got to talk about all of this at once. And I'm not going to span it over to you. You got the whole weekend. So we're just going to keep going for just a second here. Ezra 616, the dedication of the temple, keep an eye out for the return of the tangible presence of God, then the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy for the dedication of this house of God. They offered 100 bowls, 200 rams, 400 male lambs and as a sin offering for all of Israel, 12 male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel. Now note that back here in 2 Chronicles 7, which I happen to have, because I have all of the books of the Bible just bound up in one handy addition that I keep with me for this podcast in case something from other parts of it comes up, then I can just turn over there without having to go to other books or scrolls. Am I stalling because I'm having trouble finding this passage? Yes, I am. So God's glory shows up in 2 Chronicles 7. It says, when Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. The priests couldn't enter the temple of the Lord because the glory of the Lord filled it. Okay, so now back over here to Ezra chapter 6, we just sacrificed a whole bunch of things and we get to the end where we describe what all the sacrifices were and now would be the time if it's going to be like before that we should have a bunch of fire come down from heaven and the presence of the Lord arrive and then nobody can go in there or they die. Let's just keep going. Okay, so there's a bunch of sacrifices Ezra 6, 18, and they installed the priests and their divisions and the Levites and their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem according to what is written in the book of Moses. That sounded pretty final. There's a little bit left here in Ezra 6. I guess I'll just read more and we'll see maybe God's presence shows up here. On the 14th day of the first month verse 19, the exile celebrated the Passover. That's cool. Some Levites had purified themselves and we're all ceremonically clean. Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles from the brothers and priests and themselves. That's not the presence of God. Okay, so the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the Lord, the God of Israel. Oh boy, so they're still seeking the Lord, the God of Israel because he looks like at this point, he's still not there in the way he was before. There's seven days they celebrated with joy, the feast and no, I'm skimming all the way to the end here. No, there's nothing that sounds like what happened with the dedication of the first temple. So where is God? Where does he live now? Is he present but just not tangibly present this time around? Why isn't there any fire? Where is the fire? Are we going to get the fire later? The fire seemed to indicate the presence of God. His spirit is tangible manifestation among people. Why do we not have fire? And I guess we're just going to have to look through the rest of the Bible to try to figure that one out. If you look at some of the intertestamental bits of Jewish literature that Jews do not regard as scripture, but that some expressions of Christianity do regard as scripture, you will see some attitudes expressed there that God was dwelling in the temple in the second and even first century BC, but that it was a different dwelling and that it wasn't tangible. This got put to the test when the flailing Jewish, Hasmonean dynasty during the age of Julius Caesar and Pompeii, the first century BC, when they reached out to Rome to say, we're having trouble managing our own business. Can you come in and help us straighten it out? Well, that invitation proved to be too appetizing for the Romans. And yeah, they will come help you straighten it out. They totally won't stay forever and make you into a vassal state, but they did. And the very famous politician in general, Pompeii showed up and he was really curious about this second temple that was dedicated back in 516, March 12th, 516 BC. So he just went right in and by all accounts, he was fine. There's a story a little bit earlier on when one of the leaders who's descended from the Greek generals who worked with Alexander the Great in the second century BC. Apparently, he was trying to sacrifice pigs on that altar, which is absolute blasphemy. But apparently people weren't dying when they went into the temple, into the holy of holies anymore. Make of that whatever you will. It's a place where extra biblical history and intertestamental religious writings and the Bible all kind of intersect. So by the time you get to the world of Jesus of Nazareth in the early first century AD, there's this huge question and debate out there. Where is the presence of God? Is it scattered amongst his people as the prophet Joel anticipated? Or is that scattering amongst his people still going to come later on? How will God's presence manifest again? How do we get the Mouse Gewitt's family back together metaphorically? How do we encounter the tangible God with us, God among us, presence of God again, like we used to because we didn't get the payoff that we were hoping for when we tried to do everything right and dedicate the temple exactly the right way. We followed all the same steps in Ezra 6 as we did before. And now you've got hundreds of years of ambiguity and disagreement on this point. Jesus shows up and the very early going of the theological story of his life, according to John, we get this gem, John 1 14. The word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only who came from the father full of grace and truth. If you've never looked closely at the ongoing drama of the presence of God or lack thereof, if you don't feel the religious cultural historical trauma of the second temple dedication, not going like the first temple dedication, then you're not going to appreciate how hard these words of John hit. But if you have thought about that a little bit, which if you're still with me at this point in this extra long special edition of the 10 minute Bible hour podcast, you have thought about it. If you have done that, then this hits super hard. The word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen the glory, the glory of the one and only one and only are both capitalized in this translation who came from the father full of grace and truth. Now all of a sudden, pow. What John is saying right here in the early going is this Jesus who all of you reading this have heard of. He was, he is God with us, God dwelling among us, Emmanuel. And John goes on to put particular attention on all of Jesus visits to the temple, demonstrating the presence of God in this temple that everybody had been debating and waiting around to see if ever it would be filled with the presence of God. What John is pointing out was it was, but then things pivot beyond that moment and we get our fire from heaven like what we saw back in second chronicles. We finally get that tangible payoff, that tangible affirmation that everybody back then was waiting for that they spent their lives and their money and their resources and their political capital and all of their hope on it finally happens in Acts chapter two. And Jesus says, hey, hang around here in Jerusalem because my spirit is going to come upon you. He says that in one and then in chapter two, the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God, the presence of God shows up and dwells among his people. And how is this physically manifested? Maybe you remember by tongues of fire, little bits of fire over the top of each and every one of his disciples who were there and they're able to speak the language of all the different people who were there. This is so much more significant in light of the big story of the Bible than just banging how they speak all them other languages that there's crazy. I'm dung it in wrong. It's really interesting as well. But if we look at fire representing the presence of God in light of what we see in the Old Testament, it harkens back to God communicating his commissioning and his message to Moses as fire in a burning bush, which was also a fire that burned but did not consume. The disciples didn't burn up when this fire showed up. But also the idea that there is an offering being consumed and the New Testament concept of the body of the followers of Christ being offered as a living sacrifice that were crucified with Christ that we no longer live, but Christ now lives in us and the life we live in the body. We live for these good works and to do these things in the service of the king and the kingdom, it would also seem to be evocative of God affirming using a visual manifestation of his presence. Very familiar to the original audience and very familiar throughout all of the story of the Old Testament. It's a way of saying this is an offering. I accept the offering of these people's allegiance of their lives to this commissioning and this calling that have given them. And there's also a payoff here in Acts chapter two of the idea that the chosen people of God were always meant to be a priesthood that were meant to draw everyone to the worship of God. This is all over the Old Testament. Go back and listen through the minor prophets and major prophets episodes that we did in our last season where we went through one book of the Bible per day. It's all in there. And so anybody who's reading the Old Testament has to be anticipating that eventually this presence of God is going to be for everyone. Well, what happens when these tongues of fire show up? All of a sudden these people who are commissioned by God offering themselves as living sacrifices to God, they can communicate with people from all corners of the world indicating that this is for you. God's presence will dwell among the nations. And of course, most of all, it smacks of the fulfillment of what we get in the prophet Joel about the idea of God's spirit, God's presence being with his people in a new way. Now the fire tongues, they went away. We don't get an account of how those dried up or vanished or whatever. And so for most of the history of Christianity, you don't see physical manifestations that break the laws of time and space that demonstrate the presence of God. But the very end of the Bible anticipates that this will be completely visible when everything is wrapped up and sorted out and done with. And the vision for the end of time and the resolution of all of history and the vision that we get in the end of the book of Revelation for the future for how everything works out and what this redeemed kingdom and this reunification of the metaphorical Mousegoids family looks like. The vision that we get there does not include a temple. There isn't one in Revelation 21 and 22. Instead, there's a vivid description of the presence of God being with his people. Revelation 21, 3, it goes like this. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, now the dwelling of God is with men and he will live with them. They will be his people and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There'll be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away all the way back to what we were talking about at the beginning with an American tale and why stories like that of a broken relationship and reunification work for us and how that's tied in to our mortality and the odd curiosity, the unnatural thing that is death back to all of that, we see it all resolved here at the end. No more death, no more mourning, no more crying, no more pain. Every tear wiped from their eyes as God is present in a tangible, real, visible, realized way with humanity. So what we see then in this arc from the very beginning of the Bible to the end that has some high points like God showing up at the tabernacle or real high points like God showing up at the dedication of the first temple, Solomon's temple and also has some real low points like God not showing up at least not in the way that we expect at the dedication of the second temple in Ezra chapter 6 and some crazy high points like the arrival of Jesus, pleased as man with men to dwell. Jesus are Emmanuel and real high points like the tangible presence of God showing up at the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2. That whole arc starts with an unbroken relationship, traces through all of the brokenness as God faithfully carries out his redemptive plan to put this relationship back together. And then finally we see it culminate right here at the very end of the Bible in Revelation chapter 21 and 22 with the defeat of death, the consolation of humankind and an even better relationship and even better union in a tangible, real, fully realized sense between God and humanity even than what was going on in the relationship at the beginning of the Bible in the garden. I very, very, very, very rarely do mega episodes like this, but I just didn't want to break it up. It all at once. So we could put it all out on the table in front of us at once and consider this whole narrative and the big points in this whole thread of the biblical narrative together at once. And we're doing all of this. Remember, because we want to understand where people were at in this story arc in the lifetime of Esther. At that moment now we can see they're coming off of a giant wind. We got the temple built, but also there would be some questions about what the future holds and where is the presence of God now. Is he somewhere out there even when we don't see his tangible presence? Is he somewhere out there even when we don't hear his name specifically mentioned? These would be questions that the original audience to the book of Esther, the people who were there to live through those events would have been asking at this moment in the grand unfolding of the redemptive story, the grand unfolding of the story of the repairing of this relationship between God and man. And wank wank, I think because those questions would have been so prominent for those people coming off of this experience in 516 BC during the time of Esther. I think that might be why the author seems to so intentionally omit the name of God. So as to make it clear that now the redemptive plan is still on, the presence of God is still there even if we're in a chapter where the realized visible presence of God isn't quite as obvious as it has been at other times. Thanks for going super, super, super big picture with me again. If this is the first series that you've done with me on this particular podcast, you might enjoy going back over the weekend here and picking up some of those episodes that are relevant to stuff we've talked about from the previous season where we went through each book of the Bible one book per day. We cover a lot of that stuff there as well. Thank you. You're awesome. I love doing this with you. I'm Matt.
