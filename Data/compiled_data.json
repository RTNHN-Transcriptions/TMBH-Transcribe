This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and I'm excited because this is the first day of a new thing. This is the beginning of the second series that we've ever done on this podcast. The first one, which wrapped up a couple days ago, was on Matthew and I have never dove so deep into anything in the Bible ever in my whole life as I did on that book. 800 episodes we shared together. Yeah, it's a lot, but we did it and I learned a ton and I had a blast and I got to connect with so many of you. But now we're starting the second thing and what we're going to do here is not go through just a book of the Bible. We're going to go through all the Bible, but pretty quickly. We're going to cover every book of the Bible one book per day until we're done in this series. In the coming weeks, my hope is that we're going to get a much better sense together of what's going on in each book of the Bible and a better sense together of why each of those books are in the Bible. What purpose does each book serve in the grander sense of what's going on with the Bible in general? My thinking is that by putting it on a podcast called the 10 Minute Bible Hour where we just don't have a ton of time that it forces us to wait each book of the Bible equally with all of the others. So we can just line them up next to each other and see how they relate and see how they fit together. I think it's going to be fun. I think it's going to be useful. If I haven't spelled this out clearly enough already, let me just spell it out harder now. I really find this content interesting. I'm fascinated by the Bible. I'm a Christian. I've gone through the ups and downs of faith. I know what it's like to be a not Christian, but I just think this book is wildly important whether you are a person of Christian faith or any kind of faith or no faith whatsoever. I think it's wildly important if you're a person who was a Christian and you got hurt and you got dinged up and you don't quite know what to do with it now. I still think this is where you can go to find answers and to keep that process moving forward to keep it from stalling out because I know what it's like to be there. I think there's a God that made everything and I think God is behind the Bible. I think the Bible is accurate. I think it says what God means for it to say. I think it says that using a wide variety of verbal and literary techniques. I think it does that using a wide variety of genres. I think it's a book that begs for careful thought and reflection and interpretation. I also think on a lot of levels, it's really simple and straightforward. I definitely have very high optimism that the Bible can be understood by normal people. I mean, I hope so. I'm a normal person and I want to understand the Bible. But I guess that gets me the question of why. Why do I care so much? Well, like I said, I think there's a God behind it, not just a God. I think the God who made all the things is behind the Bible. And I'm getting to a place where I'm looking at the second half of life. I can start to see that taking shape a little bit and that raises some big questions. I don't know how to do everything about life. I don't know how to answer all of the big questions. If indeed there is a God who made everything and who is still interested in what's going on in this world that often seems very chaotic. And if the Bible is from that God, I would really want to understand it better. It seems like in this world of chaos and noise and lying and politics and advertising and all the other things that makes it so hard to get to any of that sweet, pure clarity or truth, it seems like the Bible holds itself out as providing that. And so I want to understand it better. And I'm guessing that if you're here, you want to understand that better as well. Maybe because you're a very empathetic person and you know religious people in your life, Christians in your life and you know this book is important to them and you just want to understand it better. I think that's hugely commendable. I'm thrilled that you would do this. I think that's a wildly mature, intellectually mature reason to have an interest in studying the Bible. Awesome. I think there are probably others of you here who hope that there is a deity behind it, that there's something bigger than us, but you're not sure. I think that's a great reason to want to get a big overview of the Bible and try to understand it. I'm guessing there are a bunch of you who are here who want to understand the Bible because like me, you think God is behind the Bible and you would like to understand it and him and life and existence and reality and what happens next better. And like me, you suspect that there might be value in stepping back from the specifics for a minute to try to get a broad view of the whole thing it wants and how it fits together. Look, wherever you're coming from, if you're here and you are hearing this, I'm glad our stories have intersected right here and I'm very excited to learn with you. Okay, there's all of that. Tomorrow, we're going to start with the book of Genesis. Might need a couple of extra minutes to make that one work because it holds itself out as covering a larger timeframe than all the other books of the Bible combined. I mean, it covers like infinity of time. So there's a lot there, but we're going to go through the story. We're going to look at the big themes and the points and cover some of the nuts and bolts of it. Who wrote it? Where did this stuff happen? What are the big questions coming out of it and hopefully in all of that and just abundantly clear why the book of Genesis is in the Bible and then we'll be on to Exodus the next day and straight on through in the classical order of books in the Bible until we're done. No matter where you're at in life, no matter what you have going on, no matter when you're listening to this, I could not be happier that you're here and I can't wait to see what you can learn together. All right. I think that's it. Tomorrow, Genesis. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon."}, {"meta_data": {"title": "Genesis", "episode_num": "BIBLE01", "pub_date": "Tue, 03 Jan 2023 05:00:00 +0000", "duration": "15:16", "subtitle": "Thanks to everyone who supports TMBH at\u00a0 You're the reason we can all do this together!

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Genesis. Today my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and I'm excited because we're starting a new series today where we're going through the entire Bible, one book per day until we're done, and we're doing them in order. Which means we got Genesis first. It's the origin story for the whole narrative of the Bible. It's the origin story for humanity, existence, the human problem, death, government, Israel, God's redemptive plan, and it is high drama from beginning to end. There's not really one human character though for you to latch on to. You figure out really quickly that the main character of Genesis is the first character to be mentioned, which is in Genesis 1-1. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. That's your main character. Also, Genesis is just a straight up long book. It's got 50 chapters, but the chapters, of course, they're added after the fact. If you really want to know which books of the Bible are the longest, you've got to look at the original Hebrew word count. And it looks like Genesis. I did not know this. It surprised me. It comes up second in the whole Bible behind only Jeremiah. Who knew? But Genesis is also a super long book in that it covers a massive timeframe that is shockingly huge compared to anything else in the Bible. The time covered in Genesis is greater, not just than all the rest of the time covered by the rest of the Bible combined. It's greater than the time covered from the end of Genesis to right now, as you and I are having this conversation. In fact, let's just say that Genesis ends around 1800 BC. That's what it looks like. It looks like it wraps up about 4000 years ago. Well, when does it start? You can't put a date on it. It starts in infinity. That's what it holds itself out is doing because it begins with only God on screen before existence even exists. So this in my mind is the biggest proposition in terms of what we need to cover in one episode of anything we're going to see in this whole series. So I might just give myself a couple of extra minutes on this one. Genesis is written by Moses, both Christian and Jewish traditions as that. The first five books of the Old Testament, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. Christians call it the Pentateuch and Jews call it the Torah. Within these five books, there are internal indications explicitly. This is like Moses wrote this part. But also, to be fair, Moses dies in one of these books. So clearly Moses didn't write the part about then he died and got buried. And it's also worth noting that in the book of John, I think chapter 5, Jesus affirms that Moses is the author of Genesis. But I don't think the Bible is making any secret at all about what kind of processes had to go into this because the whole timeline of the Bible is in the Bible. So it acknowledges that Moses is writing this way after the fact, like hundreds of years, 400 years, maybe 600 years after the end of Genesis is when Moses was latching on to the written records that he was using here, the source documents that he was drawing from, and the oral traditions that have been passed down. Bottom line, Christians believe that the entire process that went into writing Genesis sources and using genres that maybe we don't even remember anymore or fully know the dance steps of all of that, Christians believe is super intended by God to communicate exactly what he wanted to communicate to that original audience, and to people like you and me who would read it after the fact. Okay, there's that. Now let's talk about what's actually going on in the book. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. We're talking about a paradigm here that is completely different than the paradigm in which you and I live in Genesis 1 1. There aren't things yet. The markers that we use to orient ourselves in space and in time, physically, they're not there. There aren't people yet. There isn't history yet. God exists, but I'm not sure where, and I'm not even sure asking where is the right question. God is eternally as no beginning. That's how he's held out as being. That's what logic dictates as well. And the opening scene here has us in that environment. And God thinks about how he wants things to be. He's like, you know what? I'd like for there to be existence instead of non-existence. And so he uses his mind and his unbelievable power to conjure existence out of non-existence and to move that from a state of chaos and darkness to a state of order and light reflective of his character. So we get all of that in the creation account. And then we run into the crown jewel of what he made and a second paradigm that is very different from the one in which you and I live. And that is the paradigm of the garden, Adam and Eve. The man and woman live in this paradise with God and they hang out apparently. They have unbroken fellowship and Adam and Eve made in the image of God or commission to go be creative and take the raw materials that God has made. They can't make raw materials out of nothing like God can, but they can take what he has made and make beautiful things out of it. And that's what they're told to do. What an amazing commissioning. But then some stupid jerk snake comes along and is just a shady character. We don't really know a ton about him other than he doesn't like God. He doesn't like the garden thing. He doesn't like God's plan. Apparently, he doesn't like the people. And he's just mad about everything, but he's duplicitous and deceptive and dirty. And a lot of the characters later on in Genesis act a lot like him, unfortunately. And somehow he tricks Adam and Eve into eating fruit. They're not supposed to eat from a specific tree. If you eat the fruit from it, you get knowledge that humans are just too clumsy to wield. It's too sharp an instrument for their level of knowledge and character and power and ability, but God can wield. It's the knowledge of good and evil. Well, they get that knowledge. And sure enough, they can't handle it. They don't know what to do with it. It introduces a whole bunch of problems to the equation. Pain, suffering, war, death, toil, labor, labor over childbirth, separation from God. And in general, it creates, I guess, what we would call the human problem. And that brings us to the inflection point of the whole story. Imperfection has been introduced to the system. Is God going to look at that and be like, I'm done. I'll just make another one some other time. Or is God going to look at that and say, I'm going to redeem it? Remember, this God is held out as being unlimited and knowing all things. So I guess there's not much of a surprise at all that he knew this was coming. And he's already decided he's going to create a redemptive plan and make it better. Now, that plan does not immediately come into crystal clear focus. In fact, in the book of Genesis, we just get some hints here and there that might not make sense if it weren't for the benefit of the ensuing books. And then Jesus and the whole thing that he gets to, but they're still there. And the first hint comes when God is telling off this snake and pronouncing curses on him for what he's done here in Genesis chapter three. He says, Kirster, you above all the livestock and all the wild animals, you're crawling, you're bellying, you'll eat dust all the days of your life. And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers. He will crush your head and you will strike his heel. Now, it might just sound like some old mythic origin story about how the snake became such a pain in the butt for people in the world, but in light of everything else we see in the Bible. No, that's the first glimmer of hope. He's saying that Adam and Eve, eventually they're going to have some offspring. However, far down the road, who's going to take a hit from that serpent. But the woman's offspring is going to crush his head. And in doing so, defeat sin and evil and the curse and everything that's gone wrong here. Well, then for about the next eight chapters, we remain in this super distant ancient history. Again, with genres and sources that we might not totally understand, but the story still make the point in this age, which a lot of fancy Bible people call the prime evil age of the Bible. That's a prime evil. It's a great word. Back in this very, very distant old age, the story is all pointed to the same thing. Humanities wrecked. This isn't something that just went wrong once, but other people are better behaved and it's going to work out if you just give it a little bit of time. No, if you give it more time apart from God, it's going to get worse. And maybe somebody would be reading through that and think to themselves, we'll just lock up the bad people, overthrow the government, and then put the good people in charge and it will get better. But a test case for that. God gets fed up. He floods the world and he effectively resets things part way with sort of a new Adam and a new Eve. Noah survives the flood with his family. So maybe you're thinking like, Oh, well, you know, now we're in a new garden and things are going to work out, but it doesn't work out. And very shortly after getting off of that boat, he finds himself liquored up, passed out naked in a tent and one of his sons goes in there and there's some kind of bizarre incident that occurs. I don't understand the anatomy of exactly what went on there other than to say the original audience was meant to go far in horror at how absolutely depraved that was and say, yeah, never mind. There's just no set in its straight. You could reset it 100 times the floods just like that. But the disease isn't just institutional. It's in the heart of man. Something is on us. We can't help ourselves. If this curse is to be beaten, it's going to have to be beaten by God. Enter chapter 12. Enter Abram. The rest of the book of Genesis is going to track the story of this guy and his family. God picks him out of the clear blue sky is like, you right there, not because you're particularly great or special or good, but because I picked you, you, I'm making an unconditional deal with you. You have to do nothing. I am going to do the following. I'm going to make you a great name. I'm going to make you a great nation with a ton of descendants. I'm going to give you a promised land and through you, all the nations will be blessed. Abram, who becomes Abraham, gets a lot of stuff right. Gets a ton of stuff wrong. But the one thing that is credited to him as righteousness is that he believes God usually. Sometimes he doesn't. Sometimes he goes to places that are dominated by warlords or kings he's afraid of. And even though he's met and talked to God and trusts God, he doesn't trust him quite enough to think that those kings and warlords won't do bad things. So he holds out his wife as being his sister in the hope that these authority figures will welcome her into their harem and do whatever they do. And that somehow that will keep Abraham safe and he comes off looking like an idiot. At the same time, he's got moments of great trust and faith in God. Bottom line, he's a mixed bag and so are his descendants. He has a kid named Isaac when both he and Sarah are very old and Isaac is a mixed bag. Isaac has two kids we'll talk about briefly. Esau and Jacob. Esau is set to inherit this promise to Abraham through his line and his descendants. But Jacob weasels in imitating a lot of the tricks that the serpent used and he steals Esau's inheritance and then runs off and flees out to the desert where he meets a guy named Laban. And Laban uses serpent like tricks on Jacob to steal years of labor from Jacob. Then Jacob starts tricking Laban back. And even when these people tell each other the truth, it's always a monkey paw style promise. Eventually things get so tense with Laban with all the lying and tricking back and forth that Jacob has to take his four wives and his kids and go back to Esau and hope Esau will treat him well. And this scene is like a drink of cool water in the desert. Esau acts like God instead acting like the serpent. Jacob's got this whole thing rehearsed like, I'm so sorry I'm not worthy to be in Esau just embraces him and receives him back as his brother. It's absolutely beautiful. I think it's echoed in the parable of the prodigal son in Luke chapter 15. Well, Jacob, whose name eventually gets changed to Israel, has 12 sons. One of them is Joseph. Joseph is Jacob slash Israel's favorite and the brothers don't like it. One brother Judah is like, you know what? He's pushing him into a pit and selling the slavers in Egypt. And so he does. And Joseph ends up in a prison in Egypt, but then by the providence of God. He's lifted up to becoming the right hand man of Pharaoh. And God enables Joseph to anticipate a big famine and to prepare for it. And then what happens? Those other 11 brothers, they have to go to Egypt to get help. And without knowing that they crawl right back to Joseph who acts like he saw and receives them and forgives them. And they go back and they get Jacob and everybody moves to Egypt and they all have enough food. And right at the end of Genesis, Jacob is giving his blessing to all of his sons. And you would assume the promise of this blessing and this one who is to come. You would think that's going to come through the line of Joseph, but it doesn't. For whatever reason, Jacob gives it to Judah. He says in verse 49, the scepter will not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from between his feet until he comes to whom it belongs. And the obedience of the nations is his. Judah doesn't have a lot of good screen time in Genesis. Go read chapter 38 and do not bring the kids. He is stunningly dumb and bad, more often than not. And yet by him receiving this blessing and receiving the lineage that would eventually point to the one who will crush the serpent. And in doing so, crush the curse. What we're getting is a reiteration of the theme throughout Genesis that even when Abraham and his family are unfaithful, God is still faithful to see through this redemptive plan, he is going to redeem the mess. He is going to defeat the curse and he's going to do it because of his character and in spite of human resistance, even at times in spite of the people who claim to follow him. So look at that. We got a bone of feed a plot. We have a clear sense of the Genesis of God's creation as well as the Genesis of the human problem and the Genesis of God's redemptive plan through the Genesis of a new people that he is creating from scratch out of this guy named Abraham and his descendants. Okay, big picture. When we imagine Genesis, let's envision the Garden of Eden, the creation of the fall, let's envision Noah's ark, let's envision Abraham and let's envision his descendants, particularly all of them in Egypt with Joseph. If we picture those visuals, it'll make it easy to remember the main point of Genesis, which is the introduction of the problem, creation fell, humans are broken, and the promise of the solution to the problem, which is going to come through the line of Abraham. If you don't have time to go and read all of Genesis, make sure you at least check out Genesis 12, 1 through 3. That'll help you remember the gist. Alright, Genesis achievement unlocked. Nice job. One book down. Tomorrow we're going to unlock another achievement with Exodus. Alright, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon."}, {"meta_data": {"title": "Exodus", "episode_num": "BIBLE02", "pub_date": "Wed, 04 Jan 2023 05:00:00 +0000", "duration": "12:40", "subtitle": "Exodus Thanks to everyone who supports TMBH at\u00a0 You're the reason we can all do this together!

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Exodus. [\"The Bible Hour Podcast\"] Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and we're going through the whole Bible, one book per day until we're done. So this time around, we got the second book of the Bible, and it's another big one. This is Exodus. It's written by the same guy, Moses. But the difference here is that Moses was relying on a bunch of sources when he wrote what we looked at in Genesis, because that all happened way before he was alive. But this stuff in Exodus, Moses was there for all of that. Well, I should say almost all of that, because the story starts before he's alive with a political crisis. Several hundred years have gone by, roughly 400-ish, since Jacob on his deathbed gave his blessing to Judah to say the snake crusher, the one who's promised to make everything better and defeat the problem of sin, defeat the curse. He's going to come through your line, weird, screwed up son Judah, and then Jacob dies, and then Joseph dies. But Exodus opened saying that a bunch of time has gone by, and everybody forgot. The king forgot about Joseph and his contributions and the family there. And now, it's almost like the same thing that happens early on in the book of Genesis. There's been a new multiplication. This family has grown like what was promised to Abraham. You're going to be a great nation. There's going to be a lot of you. But the problem is that it's impossible to see how God is going to raise up this deliverer, this one who is going to crush the curse and defeat the serpent, because though this is now a great nation, it's a great nation totally in slavery. And it's oppressive, awful slavery. It's a people who were promised the land, but they don't have one. They don't own anything. In fact, stuff is so bad here early on, and the pharaoh of the Exodus is so vindictive in Egypt that he's got this quota of mud bricks that he's making the Hebrews hit every day. But when the Hebrews are like, hey, can we go out in the desert for like three days and do a festival and worship God like we're supposed to and stuff, the pharaoh's like, no. And in fact, quit your whining. I'm going to make your life worse. Now you have to go and get all of your own straw to make your mud bricks. But the quota is going to stay the same. So he's cracking down, but we later find out that this pharaoh is concerned that there's just getting to be too many Hebrews. And so it's kind of like the Thomas Jefferson situation where he famously said, the slavery is like having a wolf by the ears that feels like you're in control, but you're not in control because you cannot let go. Pharaoh needs these slaves to accomplish these giant building projects. He has the Hebrews build a couple of grain storage cities. I mean, these are not small contributions, but their numbers are getting to be so huge that if at any point they're like, wait, why do we follow any of these people? We should just take over Egypt and it'll be our thing now. They might be able to pull that off. So Pharaoh's like, I love having slaves, but we just got to thin out this population a little bit to reduce the risk. And so he orders everybody in the kingdom to throw all the male Hebrew babies into the river. And it's out of this pressure. The one lady has a kid who turns out to be Moses and she puts Moses in the river, sure enough, but not like right in the river. She puts him in a basket and sends him down river. And he gets adopted into Pharaoh's household and gains all of their knowledge and learning and climbs the ranks just like Joseph did. So we're seeing some story rhyming that looks a lot like the stuff that we saw in Genesis here. But before we get any further into the story here, let's just step back and talk about how this book is organized because it's really straightforward, really easy to understand what's going on. The first half of this 40 chapter book almost precisely is the story that I'm telling you right now about Pharaoh and the slavery that was going on. And Moses being raised up as this great leader in the confrontation he has with Pharaoh and how God delivers his people from the hand of Pharaoh. Then the second half, almost exactly of Exodus, all takes place out in the desert at Mount Sinai where God starts to fill in a bunch of the details of what it's actually going to look like for this huge family of Abraham's descendants now and the millions to live in communion with God. We're gonna get another covenant in a lot of ways like the covenant, the deal that God made with Abraham back in Genesis. Okay, so those are the two big parts back to what we're talking about in part one. We got a huge problem, things look horribly dire, not just for the Hebrew people, but for the whole redemptive plan in general. Much like pretty much every one of the patriarchs before Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, they all more or less have this desert experience and Moses does as well. He figures out who he is, he kills an Egyptian overlord and he has to flee, he gives up everything, he marries a lady out in the desert, gets more or less adopted into that family, and then God meets Moses and reveals himself in a burning bush and he tells Moses, hey, you're gonna go back and I'm gonna use you, you're gonna be my instrument to release these people from bondage and he's like, well, who should I send me? That's kind of a big deal and God says, I am. He reveals that his name is essence, is being. And that's a huge step forward for us in our whole Bible story because now we're getting a better sense of who God is. So Moses goes back and he famously has all those confrontations with Pharaoh and Pharaoh, at first chooses to reject what God is saying through Moses, but then later God hardens Pharaoh's heart. He's not gonna get it right is the point. And even after all of these miraculous plagues fall upon Egypt, Pharaoh's still not willing to let him go until finally in an ironic twist, the Egyptian killing of the Hebrew babies boomerangs back on the Egyptians and God kills the Egyptian firstborns. The only difference is that God provides them with a way out and some take it. And the provision that God makes is that anybody who wants their house to be passed over when this judgment comes, all they gotta do is kill a lamb and put its blood around the door posts of their house. Interestingly, in a shape that resembles a cross. It looks like this whole blood of the lamb idea is foreshadowing a bunch of stuff that's gonna happen in the Old Testament, but also it looks like it's pointing right at Jesus of Nazareth and what happens on the cross, you know, 1,200, 1,400 years later. Anyways, Pharaoh's spirits are broken. He's like, fine, go. And so they just grab everything real quick and all of the Israelites, all of the Hebrews, they just get moving out into the desert. Well, Pharaoh gets to thinking about it and he's like, that's a lot of slaves. I'd like to have them back, I suppose. And so he goes and chases them down and they get pinned up against this great big body of water, the Red Sea or maybe the Reed Sea. And it looks like everybody's doomed. Everybody's complaining at Moses, but then in yet another, one of these gigantic water flood style events, the waters part, the Hebrew people are able to pass through the waters on dry ground. They come out the other side. Pharaoh's army follows them in, the waters close in and they all drown. And now the freedom of the Hebrew people is secured. And as the waters close in, everybody's obviously euphoric and they sing this amazing song celebrating the character of God and how he sees the lowly and delivers the slaves and then they make their way through the desert to Mount Sinai. This is where again, we see a parallel with Genesis. We got that big flood event. Things seem good at first, I guess, when they get off the boat, but quickly human nature rears its ugly head. And we realize that while some evil may have been judged and vanquished, the evil that is bound to the human heart that is seen in evil and wickedness is not going anywhere. And now that we get into the second half of the book, I'm just gonna level with you. The action slows down quite a bit, big pacing change. The Mount Sinai, the story just has a couple of basic movements. Moses goes up on the mountain and God starts revealing to him what the deal is gonna be, what it's gonna look like for them to have a relationship with God. And he gives them the basic broad strokes, ground rules. These are the 10 commandments. And over the course of what is effectively, a few chapters, he spells out to Moses these basic terms. I'm gonna be your God, you're gonna be my people. The deal I made with Abraham was unconditional. This deal is a bit more conditional. One way or another, all of the nations are gonna know that I am the one true God and that I'm your God and you're my people because if you obey me, I'm gonna bless you in ways they won't be able to miss. But if you disobey me, I'm gonna punish you and correct you in ways the nations won't be able to miss. Either way, the point's going to be clear, but this dynamic really is gonna set up a lot of the narrative tension for the rest of the Old Testament. And indeed, this thing plays out almost immediately. As Moses is up on the mountain, getting more of the fleshed out details about what the law is going to look like with a particular emphasis on civic law and criminal law, like how people are supposed to treat each other. So this indicates that God is effectively holding himself out as king over his people. While that's going on down below, Moses' right-hand man, Aaron is hearing a lot of complaints from people who are still mad. And they're like, you know what? Could we just make like a big gold calf with some of the gold that God gave us as we were leaving Egypt? And Aaron's like, well, you seem like you really want to. Okay. And even though the mountain is covered in cloud and they've seen undeniable miraculous stuff, they start worshiping this golden calf. And there's your turd in the punch bowl moment just like we get after the last deluge incident with Noah and his kid and the tent and whatever was going on there. Here, this gross idolatry happens immediately. Man, what's in those first 10 commandments? You're not supposed to have idols or any gods before me. And they just signed off on this deal and they're immediately getting it wrong. God is not impressed and Moses almost has to intervene and be like, whoa, okay. But remember the point is like, how this is going to look in front of the nations and we get a very human looking negotiation between Moses and God. Well, God continues to lay things out. He's like, all right, here's the deal. I'm going to dwell among you as your God. It's not going to be a perfect union, but we're going to reestablish something that looks like the connection between God and people, a little sliver of it, like what we saw back in Genesis. So you're going to make this portable dwelling place for me. And I'm going to live in this set apart, super sacred, holy part in the middle of this tent temple, which is going to be called a tabernacle. And again, in the midst of all of this, you got the ugliness going on with the idolatry, but ultimately the tabernacle does get built. And this gets crazy. In chapter 40, God shows up. And in a measurable, empirically observable way, his presence fills this artifact called the Ark of the Covenant, which rests in the most sacred part of this tabernacle. So we leave Exodus having learned a bunch of stuff about the character of God. We leave Exodus with a new covenant between God and these people, but we also leave Exodus with a lot of questions about how this relationship between a perfect God and really flawed people is going to work. I mean, we can't even get it right here at Mount Sinai with God's obvious presence there. How's this going to play out over generations? What's going to happen when people didn't see all of these miracles? In Exodus, Moses kind of patched things up with God through a conversation, but what's it going to look like when Moses isn't there and people screw things up and they need to patch things up with God? All of those questions are going to get answered as we move forward into the next three books, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. When you visualize a book of Exodus, picture the Red Sea crossing and the giving of the law in Mount Sinai, when you think about the theme, reflect on God delivering the Hebrews and making them a people unto himself. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to check out Exodus 3, that's Moses' call, Exodus 14, that's the Red Sea thing, Exodus 20, that's the law thing, and then Exodus 32, that's the golden calf. It's kind of a lot of reading for the fast version of Exodus, but kind of a lot happens in here. All right, my friends, with that, level up on the book of Exodus for both of us, that is exciting, and we are on to the book of Leviticus, Manyana, a mat. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Leviticus. Hey my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and we have arrived at the metaphorical shipwreck graveyard where all of the well-intentioned Bible in a year reading plans go to die. It's the third book of the Bible. It's Leviticus. And even now there are probably some of you who are like, I remember as traumatic the last time I tried to do nothing made any sense, it's a nightmare. But I, my friends, I'm here to tell you it is not a nightmare. You just need the 10,000 foot view. This is actually a beautifully organized book that makes mountains of sense. It has a teeny, tiny, simple little narrative through line. And I think we're going to have no trouble sorting this one out before we get going. I just got to say that the stuff that we're about to talk about here in terms of Leviticus, this isn't something I figured out. People have known this since forever, like centuries and millennia. They have seen this structure to it. So you got to any book or any introduction and any study Bible. They're going to point this out as well. But don't feel bad if you didn't get it the last time you tried to slog through Leviticus because these categories that make it make sense, this structure that makes it so beautiful and symmetrical, it is not immediately evident, especially because you're coming off a too rich, thick, creamy narrative books, 90 chapters worth of high drama and fascinating characters and calamitous consequences and generous, gracious God over the course of Genesis and Exodus. But then you get to change up when you get to Leviticus and it starts to read differently. Okay, when you picture Exodus and Leviticus, you got to imagine a Venn diagram where there's a teeny, tiny little sliver of overlap between the end of Exodus and the beginning of Leviticus. We didn't talk about this last time, but right at the end of Exodus, they get the tabernacle, the temporary traveling temple built where the holiness, the presence of God lives in the ark of the covenant. And when they get the thing done, it's all dedicated and set up. God shows up. It says, then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Well, rad. We made a thing, we did what God said and sure enough, he showed up. That's got to be pretty affirming, right? But then get this, Moses, according to Exodus 40 and verse 35, could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled upon it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. What? Well, how are you supposed to have a relationship with God if you can't go anywhere near God? And if you're Moses, it's going to be hugely disappointing because you got to hang out with God a lot. You can hang out with them at the burning bush. You hang out with God on the mountain, but now is confusing because it felt like this whole covenant thing and the whole story was moving toward God being more in relationship with his people. But now the priest, the mediator, the chief representative, he can't even go in the tent. So what gives? Turn the page. Well, it's a study Bible since a couple of pages over to the beginning of Leviticus. And we see we're in the exact same place. Moses can't go into the tent. Leviticus 1-1. The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said, speak to the Israelites and say to them, when any of you brings an offering to the Lord, bring as you're offering an animal from either the herd or the flock and right there, the first instruction from God causes knee jerk painful reaction, maybe a little bit of shame from the last time you tried to read through the Bible and Leviticus got you hung up. You're like, Oh, here we go with all the sacrifices and stuff. I still promise this is all going to make sense. But back to the plot. We got a problem. Nobody can go into this tent now. There's distance between God and the people. And so the billion dollar question of the book of Leviticus is, well, how can we be closer to God? How can we live in communion and community with God? And maybe the natural way to conceive of what's going on here, relationally is that God is like he's hurt and he's angry and he's a little bit grumpy about things. And he wanted to be wanted and liked more and they just don't like him enough. But that's an anthropomorphism. That's not what God is doing here. What we discover as the book of Leviticus unfolds in is we get a little more detail about how God is is a God is holy. He's powerful. He's not like us. He's different. Think of something that's enormously powerful. It's also beautiful and that you respect and kind of want to be around. But maybe it wouldn't be the best idea without maximum preparation. For example, a Siberian tiger, those things are majestic and beautiful and amazing. You can't just walk up to a Siberian tiger, like jump a fence in the zoo and just go stroll around in there and assume that's going to work out. I mean, you see some people who do all kinds of work to prepare themselves to be able to be around something that powerful. But there's a lot that goes into that. And even then the power is so overwhelming that you better be real, real careful. Well, the metaphor falls short here because it's a Siberian tiger comes nowhere near to encapsulating the magnificent holiness and power of God, the unbearable, even glory of God. And that is what is putting the obstacle between Moses and being able to go into the tent. And so Leviticus is just about how are we going to solve this problem. And this is the part where I told you it divides up really neatly into three matching sections on the front end and on the back end of the book with a middle pivot point. This is a very common structure in Hebrew literature called chiasm. So again, just to work track on with each other, picture seven sections in this book, the first and the seventh sections deal with the same material, those being the rituals that will play out in the life and annual rhythm of the people in communion with God segments two and six of the book of Leviticus deal with the mediators, a special class that God was appointing to specialize in preparing themselves to be in the presence of the tiger to be in the presence of this enormous power. And there's a lot that goes into that. So it gets a lot of discussion sections three and five deal with purity. And when we get to that section, we're going to talk a lot about what purity means in this regard because it might not be exactly what you're picturing. And then there's a middle section that seems to summarize the whole principle of the entire book and it kind of offers a catch all solution for anything we might have forgotten. Okay, the ritual stuff sections one and section seven. Here we get all the business that you've probably heard of about a sacrificial system. Like we talked about at the end of Exodus, we got this lingering question, like how do you fix it when you screw things up with your relationship with God? Uh huh. Well, Leviticus deals with this. The first section is on the sacrificial system and what each individual should do depending on what they got wrong or what time of year that we're talking about section seven on ritual stuff deals with the calendar year, then all of these different festivals that happen that all have a story from what God has already done attached to them. And with both of these, there's a certain way that everything is supposed to be carried out and quite a significant degree of specificity. And that's where a lot of readers get bogged down in Leviticus. So sections one and seven that deals with the ritual stuff sacrifices and festivals sections two and six once again deal with the mediators, the priests, the people who go between. And the first part has a little bit more narrative to it. That includes the story of some flippant priests who didn't really take seriously their responsibility. They went too close to the tiger and they did not prepare themselves properly and they died. Then that little narrative thread kind of goes into suspended animation and gets picked up again in sections six where we learn more about how these priests are supposed to be and what they need to do to get themselves ready to go into the presence of the metaphorical tiger so that they can properly serve as a go between between the people and God, which is obviously a very important role. Then in sections three and five, we get a whole new concept introduced here, but it's a very important one for understanding the rest of the Old Testament and for understanding the significance of Jesus and the stuff that he does and the moves that he makes. And this is about the categories clean and unclean. Don't confuse this necessarily with naughty and nice. There's all kinds of stuff according to Leviticus that a person might do in the natural course of living and dying and going to the bathroom and being a human who has fluids and things that happen periodically that for whatever reason in the mind of God makes you unprepared or unclean, unready to go into his presence. And it's not a guilt thing. There are processes or time limits where in this uncleanness expires. It's a preparation thing. It's a right state of mind, right state of presentation thing that this clean and unclean stuff deals with. Now some of the business that relates to clean and unclean here in section three and section five happens to overlap with moral stuff. How you treat other people, what you do with your relationships, including the most intimate aspects of relationships. But it also includes things that aren't really naughty or nice once again, like just what food you eat. And this is where we start to get the idea of what now modern Jews refer to as kosher. It's clean and unclean. Now maybe you're thinking that is a lot of stuff to keep track of. You get six rhyming segments that deal with these great big concepts all the way from the national holiday festival level all the way down to digi something you weren't supposed to eat. Or did you come into contact with a fluid associated with the giving of life, in which case, in my case, I'm not clean to how many days is that it's a lot to take in. And the middle section block four just serves as this catch all for everything. You got this grandest of all festivals. It's a day of atonement. There's a sacrifice that happens there that covers everything that you might have screwed up or got wrong, you meant to get it right. And it didn't work out. And this catch all is very important in setting up the idea of Jesus as the fulfillment of the sacrificial system more on that as we go along. But then there's a second sacrifice where you don't actually end up killing the animal. You send it out into the desert after going through a religious ritual by which you put all of the guilt of the nation onto that animal and then send it off. That's the scapegoat. And that guilt just runs off with that goat into the wilderness, both pointing toward God's enormous forgiveness as far as the East is from the West. It's just gone, but also pointing to again the concept of guilt being shifted from those who actually own it and bear the weight of it to someone else who could take the place of the guilty in absorbing that punishment. And obviously that again points to Jesus. The very last thing that we get in the book of Leviticus is Moses just reiterating what the terms of the covenant are. God's going to be our God. We're going to be his people. It's a conditional covenant though. So like take this stuff in Leviticus seriously. If we obey him, all the nations are going to know that he's the one true God because he's going to bless us. And if we disobey him, all the nations will still know that he's the one true God because he's going to punish us. That leaves us with just one question about Leviticus. We got a plot thread that's still hanging out there. Moses couldn't go into the presence of God. We have a question. How do you get near the tiger? How do you get near this power? Well, what we just covered was God's answer. Here's what it looks like to live in community with God in this context of the Old Testament. It's complex. It's a lot. But if we go and look closely and we start peeling back the layers, we see that it all provides for right living in this community, in this moment in history that it points to the character of God and that it sets things up for the big payoff in the redemptive plan, which again is going to be Jesus. I keep teasing this. We get the narrative thread. Did it work? Can Moses now go into the presence of God? And what we discover after all of this is that now Moses is able to go into the tent. So in summary, when you visualize Leviticus, picture obviously the law. When you think about the theme of Leviticus, reflect on how God makes it possible to approach his holiness. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you hit Leviticus 1711. That kind of gives you the fast gist of a lot of what's going on in the book. And make sure to catch the last verse of the book itself. Yeah, look at us. That's another level up. This time on the book of Leviticus, I'm excited about how this is going. Next time around, we're going to be in numbers. Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about numbers. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. The name of this book is Numbers, and I think the name is Trash. And look, I understand the sum of your, our gasping right now. And you can't say the name of a book of the Bible is dumb or bad. Can't I? Because that part isn't actually inspired by God. Christians don't believe that. It could have been named something better. Look, I get why they called it numbers because there's a census at the beginning and there's a census at the end. And in this ancient Near Eastern Bronze Age context, the fact that the people descended from Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, slash Israel, and then his sons, we talked about Joseph and Judah, for example, the fact that these people grew up into this gigantic people group, well, just the numbers alone tell a story that God is keeping his promise that Abraham would be taken from being just like some guy from the middle of nowhere. And then he would become this great nation with descendants, as numerous as the stars. It's happening and further in that ancient Near Eastern context. There's a big deal of just having a lot of people. That is power, having a lot of livestock, having a lot of descendants, a lot of first born sons, branched out and diverse family that has chieftains and tribes within it. That comes with a lot of opportunity. But right now, this people group is homeless. However, if you recall that promise, God made Abraham one of the four things that was in there is that there was a land that was promised and that land is Canaan. So the plot of numbers isn't really there was two censuses and look, there's a lot of descendants of Abraham now. The plot is going from Mount Sinai where we end up at the end of Exodus and where the law is revealed or the beginnings of the law and where we are throughout the entire book of Leviticus. While we figure out why Moses can't go into the tent, while we're figuring out what it takes to prepare oneself to be in the presence of the beauty and the power and the terror and the awe-inspiringness of the metaphorical tiger, that is of the holy God. While we're figuring that out in Leviticus, we're also still at Mount Sinai. But then we get into numbers and we find that the question of being able to enter into the presence of God for Moses has been resolved. We know enough of the ground rules now that it's time to move. And so the first 10 chapters of numbers opens with the census to get a sense of how many fighting men we're going to have, but the reason we got to find out how many fighting men we're going to have is because we're not just going to look at a bunch of numbers. We're going to have a great big giant quest. We're going to have this journey through the desert. It should only take half a month. And all you got to do is just walk to Canaan right up there to the south end of modern day Israel and go in there and defeat a bunch of people who God already said he was going to defeat. I mean, he already beat Egypt. Are you kidding me? It's the most powerful empire on the planet at this point. He's going to have no trouble with these little local tribal kings and chieftains that are scattered around Canaan. You just got to go there and God's going to take care of everything. And so maybe on the front end of the book of numbers, at least a different name that you could give it would be like the journey to the conquest or Moses grand conquering march. That sounded pretty good, but we'll discover as we go through the book of numbers that you can still come up with a more dramatic name, the numbers. But it's not so concrete after all because this thing goes south in a hurry. Again, the first 10 chapters were still at Mount Sinai. Everything's going really pretty well. It looks like we're past some of the Iq and mix up from the end of Exodus. The relationship with God is right. God gives a bunch of directions early on here in numbers for how the camp is to be organized and what the deal is going to be with God leading Israel into conquest by his presence. And there's even symbolic significance in just the way the camp is designed at all points to this is not a normal people group with a normal king. The one true God maker of all things who is in the early phases of his grand redemptive plan. He is the one who is at the center. And then when they are progressing at the head of this entire people group and everything that they're setting out to accomplish. So we get the numbers, we get the plan for the camp. We get a sense of what the priests and the leaders need to do even more so than we get in Leviticus for how to lead and how to be pure and how to be the go between between the people and God. And I start traveling and I'm not kidding you. Have you ever gone on a trip and you're like, all right, we should be fine. And within 15 minutes of being on the interstate, your kids who you love are immediately like I have to poop. Why didn't you poop at home, Kyle? I didn't have to poop then. You couldn't have, you couldn't have figured out. I really have to stop now. Oh my goodness. He's touching me. He's touching me. Okay. Nobody touch anybody. Oh my goodness. We're at mile marker 14. How on earth can we already be to this state? We have 2,500 miles to drive. I've never experienced anything like that. But maybe you have. That's the kind of stuff that we get here except way worse. These complaints aren't just like I'm not having fun. I'm not enjoying the food that God is miraculously providing from the heavens in the form of manna rather. These are the kind of complaints that are like, can we just go back to being slaves? We hate it that much. This plan is dumb. We don't like following God in this way. Egypt was fine. Let's just un-exodus. Maybe he would part the sea again for us to go back. If we went the exact same way, we could even get some free chariot parts on the way by and God is an impressed. Even Miriam and Aaron, his own family members start calling Moses out in front of everybody. The wheels are coming off. Well, the journey continues though. It is not a pleasant one by any stretch of the imagination. They make their way right up to the southern end of what I guess you would call the promised land to a place called the wilderness of Peron or Peron. That takes us from chapter 13 up to the beginning of chapter 20. Here Moses is like, all right, all I have to do is just endure this a little bit longer. It's loud in this minivan. We're going to get to where we're going. It's going to be fine. He's a little bit beleaguered. He doesn't totally have everybody's support, but it's been an exhausting trip. He sends a bunch of spies into the land. We get all of their names and these 12 spies go in. This land has already been promised to them. God's already done miraculous stuff, but they come back out and in front of everybody, 10 of the spies are like, no, it's never going to happen. They got giants in there. It's just we're totally going to lose. It's not even that great actually. I don't know. I wouldn't do that. No constructive proposal for where to go with, you know, a couple million people or whatever in an inhospitable desert, but they do not want to go in there. Well, two of the spies are like, actually, I think we got it. It's going to be great. We should go right now. God will surely deliver this into our hands. Let's just let's go. Well, the crowd sides with the 10 and they turn on Moses in a way that is ugly. They try to mutiny and kill him and replace him. There's jealousy over the role of Aaron and his family and the priesthood. This family of a guy named Cora, they start throwing a fit about things and then stuff gets real. You start getting plagues in the camp and then eventually you get snakes in the camp and these sons of Cora who are complaining about stuff, the earth opens up and just devours them like in some kind of cartoon you watched when you were a kid, you would think things like this would cause people to be like, we should stop complaining on our road trip and just go conquer the thing. If God can eat people with the ground when they complain loudly enough, he can probably help us conquer these tiny little chieftains and tribal leaders in a land that he's promised to us, but nope, they complain a whole bunch. In the end, despite Moses' intercession, God's like, no, I'm going to give the people what they want. They don't want to go into the land. They don't want to conquer it. Cool. I'm going to let all of that generation die, but through the conversation with Moses, it's agreed upon that the next generation, the complainer's kids will get to go in. This is just a heartbreaking turn of events because it means the one these people are never going to go in, but two, it also means you're going to have to wander around in a desert on this miserable road trip in the metaphorical minivan with those metaphorically loud and smelly kids who are at each other's throats until everyone from that generation dies. So now we start our second travel segment, and this one is to nowhere, I guess, like just kind of driving around around about again and again and again. And now the complaining is getting insane than Moses. And now there's no plan. Where the heck is this supposed to go now? Why am I even leading these people? What do we do? And he loses his cool people are complaining about water. Moses is supposed to do a miracle to give him water. He doesn't do it the way God said he does it out of anger and in a way that's in defiance of God and the water comes out anyway, but that's enough for God to be like, even you Moses, you don't get to go in the land, not even you. It's on these travels that I mentioned earlier that the snake thing happens and yet even in the midst of these plagues and these punishments God is still delivering them and still protecting them, including making this bronze snake that gets lifted up out in the wilderness. When people look at it, they get better from their snake bites. So we're back to the question of what do we call the book of numbers about two thirds of the way through it. Numbers is still boring to me. But the grand march of conquest, that doesn't work anymore. The nightmare minivan road trip from hell with everybody who just complains all the time. And now you have to drive around until everybody dies and then only their kids can get to the ultimate destination. That's too wordy. It turns out the Jewish people saw this conundrum as well. They didn't call the book numbers. They called it the wanderings in the wilderness. And I think that's a lot more reflective of the futility that you feel as you read through this book. And I think God's anger with the whole mess comes through in this very scary thing in numbers 14 that he has Moses say to the people are griping about everything. He says, so tell them as quote God, as surely as I live declares the Lord, I will do to you the very things I heard you say in this desert, your bodies will fall. Every one of you, 20 years old and more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me, not one of you will enter the land. I swore with uplifted hand to make your home except Caleb son of Jeff and Joshua son of none. As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you've rejected. But you, your bodies will fall in this desert. Your children will be shepherds here for 40 years, suffering for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies in the desert for 40 years. One year for each of the 40 days you explored the land. That's how long the spies were in there. You will suffer for your sins and know this is the scary part. What it is like to have me against you. Well, finally, they go through a bunch of trials, a bunch of time passes and they're the doorstep of the promised land again toward the end of numbers. And now the people around there, the local kings and stuff are starting to freak out. And there are some particular people groups who hire a local prophet named Balaam. This guy is a mystery. And we get this huge chunk of the end of numbers is just about Balaam being hired with money to go and curse Israel. But he can't do it. An angel shows up. God shows up. And instead of cursing Israel, Balaam keeps giving these oracles. This sounds a whole lot like the promises to Abraham and even Moses. And in the fourth of these four grand oracles of blessing that Balaam can't help but utter. And as he's trying to fulfill his contract and curse the people of Israel, God will let him. And in the final of these oracles, he says this, I bet you've heard it before. I see him, but not now. I behold him, but not near a star will come out of Jacob. A scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of chef. And it goes on like that for a while. Obviously, there's an immediate interpretation to this. And also there's obviously a long term interpretation to this as there is with the serpent that is raised up. And you raised up like it's on a cross. It's lifted up. If you look at it, it heals your affliction as there is with a sacrifice that happens in the middle of the book of numbers. It's a substitution for the sins of the camp. There's a whole lot in here that seems to point right at Jesus. And indeed, the New Testament authors are often keen to look back at numbers to make a lot of those same points. The book of numbers ends with the people of Israel camped out at the doorstep, looking in toward the promised land, primed to go in and do something they could have done many, many years earlier. Effectively what happened here is they went out in the desert and they failed the test of trusting God. They were tempted by their hunger and their thirst and their anxiety and it got the best of them. But even that points to another moment that we're going to run into in Matthew chapter four where somebody else goes out in the desert to face those tests that all humans face. And he passes them. And it turns out that the one guy who could pass the test of the temptation of sin is also the star who will come out of Jacob predicted by Balaam. When you visualize the book of numbers, picture the Israelites wandering around in the wilderness. When you think about the theme, reflect on how Israel failed the test in the desert, but God persists anyway.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Deuteronomy. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Today we're on the fifth book of the Bible. This is the last book of the opening chunk of the Bible that Christians call the Pentateuch, Jews call the Torah. And all of this is written by Moses, but we get a very different version of Moses in all of them. And now that we're into the book of Deuteronomy, we are getting old man reflective Moses, who is no longer throwing his energy at the other old people. He is throwing his energy at the next generation. And his motivation for this is more than just a reflection on his life and thinking, I want to have a legacy here, and so I need to invest in these young people. There's something going on here in terms of God's relationship with the people that is prompting this. And that is, as you'll recall from the previous book Numbers, that it was only supposed to take two weeks to go from Mount Sinai where God gave the law at the end of Exodus. Then at the beginning of Numbers, it's supposed to take like just two weeks to walk up to Canaan and be like, well, the God who did all that other miraculous stuff, he's going to deliver these little kingdoms and tribes and stuff into our hands. And then we're going to have the land that was promised to Abraham. This is so exciting. But the people despite all they've seen, despite the fact that they're literally being led by like the visible presence of God with a cloud in the book of Numbers, they're just not up for it. They don't have the heart for it, and they're really complaining. And in Numbers 14, the people decide, now we got to depose Moses, is the wrong leadership. We're not going in and taking the land. We don't have any plan B. I don't know what we're going to do instead. But we can't go there. Maybe back to Egypt. I don't know, but we're out. And then in one of the most horrifying passages in the whole Bible, God responds to the people of Israel and is like, okay, I'm going to give you what you want. For each of the 40 days, the spies were in there checking out the land. You all are going to spend one year out here in the desert wandering around aimlessly until all of this generation who rejected my leadership as God are dead. And then the next generation will go in and take the land and we'll move forward with them. You're going to find out what it's like to have me against you. Dang. Well, between what we hear about Numbers and what we get in Deuteronomy, something like 40 years pass and a bunch of the old generation who complained and were stubborn and rejected God's leadership. They have died off. In fact, they're almost all dead. And now Israel is right at the doorstep of the promised land with a whole new generation that's been raised up and we come into the book of Deuteronomy. And Deuteronomy on its surface, this looks incredibly boring and maybe redundant. I'm not trying to be mean to the Bible. I really, really like it. That's why I do this podcast, why we're having these conversations. I think it's great. But come on, let's be honest, on the surface, it looks like we've already covered the material that's in Deuteronomy. Heck, even the name means second law, like we're taking another run at this thing. But a closer look at this book demonstrates that there's something really interesting happening here narratively and that we're learning more stuff about God and his character and their dented plan and how it's all going to play out. So the book is structured around a series of speeches from Moses. The first speech is basically just a rehash of what we got in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers with a lot of emphasis on Numbers. So it's the story I was just recapping about everything that God has done and how the people behaved the way they did and why God has allowed them to wander in the desert for all this time. But who's Moses talking to in this speech and why does he have to review all of this? Well, again, he's talking to the kids. They don't get everything right in the book of Deuteronomy. They're a little bit complaining, but not as much as their parents because they never knew Egypt and the relative stability, though it was slave stability, that was enjoyed there. In the desert, there's no sense of how the provision is going to happen. It's dry and hot and miserable and boring. And you might think of Egypt that way, but Egypt at this point in history was like the most fertile, lush, temperate place you could possibly imagine living except other than maybe Canaan, this land flowing of milk and honey that is promised to them. The point is this next generation, they ain't perfect, but they don't know all of these details and they might be assigning their own narrative to everything that's happened here. And Moses is like, no, I'm going to give you a recap so that you are crystal clear on what the actual narrative is and so that you understand it's not flattering. He's like, I just got to boil it down to the point for these guys of all the law and the commands and everything else. And so he says this in Deuteronomy 6, 4, hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts and press them upon your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up, tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates. That is obviously a very famous passage. This gets referenced in the Gospels, a whole bunch, Jesus affirms that this is the chief commandment and he says and also love your neighbor as yourself. There's a term for this beautiful part of scripture. It's called the Shema and it's this heartfelt call, not just do what God says and go conquer some land or whatever. I mean, that's in there, but it's to love God. A theme that is paid off in the Sermon on the Mount when Jesus shows up in his first big speech as a public figure is to call people back to the impulse that's right here to love God with your heart, not to do these religious activities and so forth just for external approval or because these are the social dance steps we've all agreed upon, but to reflect on the character of God in the heart of God's commands and to operate in keeping with those, what we call in the New Testament, values of the kingdom. The emphasis here is that Israel has one God and they're only going to worship this one God. It's a preparatory statement before they go into this land that has a whole lot of different gods. We're not going to worship those gods. To do so would be calamitous and not just because it would pollute the purity of the Hebrew people, but because the Hebrew people are unique, they're carrying the redemptive plan in their lineage. They are a nation of priests who are to bless the nations. You just can't go mingle your religion with a bunch of fake religions. It waters the whole thing down. You can't risk it. You're playing with fire there. So the second speech that Moses gives is again, this theme of a second law. It's an expansion on, a reiteration of a whole bunch of the stuff that we saw back in Leviticus. And there's a bunch of stuff in this law that has a lot to do with relationships between people and how to do society. This sounds very familiar and just makes sense. It's intuitive. There's a few things in here though that you're going to look at and go, it seems oddly specific. I don't totally get why that is a rule. But if you look closely enough at all of it, you will see two things that are at the heart of all of these laws that God is lying down and that Moses is reciting to this next generation that's about to take the land. One, these laws are somehow instructive regarding the character of God. And two, at the heart of all of these things is right relationship with others and some notion of justice. Now, that notion of justice isn't going to make a ton of sense unless you contrast it with the global understanding of law and justice and people and societal roles and all of that that existed. If you imagine that whatever laws and social preferences we have now is the most enlightened humanity has ever been, and there's a lot of hubris in that assumption, but if you assume that, then these laws are going to look a little bit backwards at times. But if you look at them in the historical context, they're going to look wildly progressive, inclusive, conscious of the people in society who would have no power or recourse to get justice for the things that other people might inflict on them. The original audience, this new generation that is receiving this second uttering of the law, they're going to get that. They're going to have their minds blown when they understand what everybody else is doing with the law compared to what they're going to do with the law. Not for you and me, it takes a little bit of thinking outside of ourselves to fully appreciate everything that's going on there. The final speech from Moses has a really different feel. It's like the last hurrah of an old dude, an old dude being informed directly by God, I should say, urging this next generation to care about the right stuff. And he's realistic in these closing words of his life and his ministries. Like, you're going to screw things up. It's going to get bad. You're going to sin. You're going to rebel. You're going to get corrected by God when you go into the land, but you're also going to obey and you're also going to get things right. So he reiterates the basic terms of the covenant that we get all the way back from the book of Exodus. God is going to be your God. You are going to be his people, but we're still a nation of priests. All of this is happening in the view of the world and with the long-term redemption of the larger world in mind. So everybody's going to know that yours is the one true God. If you obey him, he's going to bless you. If you disobey him, he's going to punish you. He even very humbly and honestly points to himself both in the first speech and in this speech as an example of both of those realities in his own life. So at the very end of the last book of the five books of Moses, in his final blessing to this new generation, Moses reiterates themes that are woven into the four books that came before, including this one about the brokenness of humanity, an evil, a stain, a darkness that is on the heart, an inability to help ourselves, even if we change our conditions or our government, or even if there's a big purge, it doesn't matter. Something is broken. There's a curse of sin and death and separation from God that traces all the way back to the stunt that serpent pulled in the garden. But right after the serpent pulled that stunt, God in his curse of that serpent also offers this promise of blessing. There's this one who is to come. This one is going to get struck by the serpent, but who's ultimately going to crush the head of the serpent. We now know that one is going to come out of the line of Abraham. We now know that it's going to come out of this nation that is in covenant with God through the covenant that God made with Moses. We know that this one who is to come, who's going to straighten things out, that no human has been able to find a way to straighten out, that even strict obedience to the law, we can now tell, even that won't work to straighten this out, that one is coming. And there's going to be some mechanism in there by which the heart of humanity can be made whole, can be made right, and a return to the paradigm of Eden, or maybe even something better can be in view. Then, like Aaron before him, Moses hands off authority to the next guy. It's Joshua, and he goes up on the mountain, and he dies, and he never makes it into the promised land at all. But wow, does he play his role in moving this story forward. So I think what we just saw is a great prologue that sets up all the questions that are going to be answered throughout the rest of the Bible. How's this relationship going to play out between God and this nation of priests? Israel? How's the conquest going to go? How's this generation going to do? What are they going to screw up? What are they going to get right? How's the next generation going to do? When you visualize the book of Deuteronomy, picture Old Man Moses explaining the law to the kids, or maybe more simply, just visualize a contract, a covenant. When you think about the theme, think about that lasting covenant, and how it's going to transcend generations. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, check out Deuteronomy 6, and then the song of Moses in Deuteronomy 32. And on that note, I'm proud to announce that we have leveled up on Deuteronomy. Nice job, everybody. Next time around, we are past the writings of Moses and into a new regime, new leadership. We're into the book of Joshua, and it looks like the plot is about to move forward very dramatically. I'm excited for it. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Joshua. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Have you ever got together with a bunch of friends, family, whatever, and you're going to watch a movie, but it's a movie that's a part of a larger series, and then somebody who hasn't seen them all asks the obvious question, well, do I need to see the other ones in order for this to make sense? And sometimes you're like, no, the movie we're about to watch is a perfect one-off movie. You're going to be just fine. Other times you think about it for a minute, you're like, yeah, yeah, this one's not going to make a ton of sense unless you see it in the larger context. Joshua is the latter. You really need to see this one in the larger context of all of the other books we've seen so far and all the ones that are to come for it to make sense. Now, just straight through the front door, if you treat Joshua like a one-off and you don't look at all of the other books of the Bible with it, it feels like an ancient Near Eastern conquest account with some chest thumping and a large percentage of the book being dedicated to justifying current boundaries for future generations, a very common genre in the ancient world. But if you've read all the other books of the Bible so far and you read what comes after it, then instead Joshua comes off as something very unique even though it employs some aspects of the genre that would be familiar to the original audience, it comes off like an important chapter in a much bigger, redemptive story. God makes the world at a nothing. He makes people in his own image. Things fall apart. They choose rebellion. They choose sin. They choose failure. God is going to fix the problem through a family, one guy's descendants, Abraham. He makes a covenant, an unconditional covenant with Abraham to say, even if you're an idiot, I'm doing this, I'm going to redeem through you. You're going to be this great people, this great nation. You're going to have this land where you can set up shop for the long haul and redemption for the whole world is going to come through you. You're going to be a blessing to all the nations. God leads them out of slavery in Egypt. Now we're ready to go conquer the land, the generation that got led out of Egypt in Exodus. There's not up for it. They complain a lot and they like the desert better, I guess. And now the next generation takes over and as we go into Joshua, we're going to enter the promised land of Canaan, but there are people in there. Now in those first five books of the Bible, we've learned a little bit about these people. It's a mess. It's very ugly. They're doing child murder stuff and this society is held out even by ancient world standards as being uniquely screwed up. And it looks as though God, who's already demonstrated that he is willing to show mercy but also willing to judge. It looks like he's got Canaan in the crosshairs and he intends to use his own very flawed people group, the Israelites, to go and be the instrument of his punishment against Canaan, but also to establish his chosen people in a place where they won't get wiped off the map and forgotten the history. And that is the conundrum of Joshua that we got to understand before we even crack open this book. We're not talking about the era of the UN where deciding boards somewhere and whoever has the most guns and most nukes kind of decides who gets to live where and what maintains the general balance of a very fragile political stability that we keep trying to duct tape together around planet earth. It's not like that at all. Here you got all kinds of families, people, chieftains, warlords, tribes, running all around the ancient Near East. Some of those gel and with stability, especially around predictable weather and water, they grow into a people, a nation, a kingdom, maybe even an empire. Everybody else, they get lost, absorbed gradually. And I know this next thing sounds horrifying in modern terms, but we're talking about a very different time, very different pressures. Gradually most of these forgotten tribes just get bred out of existence. They get absorbed into another people group and they're not even a footnote in history. We don't know anything about them. They're language, their story, their beliefs about God, any of that stuff. So in an ancient Near Eastern context, any reader looking at the first five books of the Bible and now into Joshua, considering what to make of these people who apparently are chosen by the one true God, look, you're going to have to have a place to set up shop and you're going to have to have a lot of numbers. That's why the book of numbers celebrates the numbers. It's why there's all of that stuff about the census that book points out that God kept his promise to Abraham that he would be this big, numerous people. Joshua then is the book that's the fulfillment about the thing about, hey, you're going to have a land which would be the burning question for everybody in the original audience as to whether this people group is going to continue to exist or go away like everybody else. If you're nomadic at this point in history and you don't eventually find a place to get down roots, build things, raise crops, defend your boundaries, et cetera, you just go away. Well, that doesn't square very well with the redemptive plan we've learned about in the first five books of the Bible. Now my seem to you like, when are we actually going to get to Joshua? No, no, no, this is Joshua. All the other books around it do the heavy lifting on how this book works. So Joshua's the main character of the book of Joshua, but the text does not hold him out as being the author of this book. The text doesn't tell us who the author is, even though Joshua clearly contributed to parts of it. But to get into the specific of the guts of this book itself, it looks like it pretty neatly divides into two parts. The first part is the conquest, the second part is what are you going to do with it? The first part is violent and shocking to modern sensibilities. Wasn't shocking to modern sensibilities even 50 or 60 years ago, but we are at a different point in history. And we're asking, I think good moral questions about how we ought to treat each other and what role violence should play in international politics. And so I'm glad that we bulk at some of the stuff that we see here. But effectively, what we get on the pages of Joshua in the first half of the book is the story of a theocracy. God has held himself out as king. He's done enough stuff to make it clear that he's actually there and that this isn't just some cooke prophet who goes off in some little corner in secret and is like, I learned some new secret stuff. No, the giving of all of the law to Moses happened on the mountain and people could see the evidence of God's presence and thunder and everything that was going on up there. And then all of the miracles and stuff that happens in the desert and it's important to note that this theocracy was led by the actual visible physical presence of God in the form of this cloud, this presence that is moving them around through the desert. That's always there. It doesn't make any sense. It defies reality. So if somebody today comes along as like, I think God told me that we should probably go and wipe out this country and just occupy it because of religious reasons. My first question would be, is there a giant physics defying cloud that is present through the entire process? And you have dozens and dozens of miraculous things occurring to back it up because that is what we're seeing in Joshua. God is held out as being king here. Well, the other thing we see through this is that stressing of that covenant God made with Moses throughout the conquest portion of the first half of the book. Every time the Israelite people act like the Canaanite people or don't do what God said, God punishes his own people with the same vigorous impulse to justice that he's punishing the Canaanites with. So it's not like they're getting a sweetheart deal here. And after one particular conquest, somebody selfishly decides to break the rules and be like, I'm going to take care of my own provision and no longer trust God for his provision. And it's not until justice is carried out for that crime against the king, which in this case is literally God that victories can resume and this conquest can continue. There's a lot of language throughout this conquest portion of the book that sounds like a complete annihilation of the Canaanite people took place. And some people look at that and I just has to be hyperbole, in part because we still hear about Canaanites being around later. There's a little story in the middle about the Gibeonites and a deal that they work through tremendous shrewdness to be spared by the invading Israelites. Obviously there's a story of Rahab, the harlot who favors the spies who come to Jericho and is spared when Jericho's walls fall down. And the famous story about the music and the march going around the walls of Jericho. So maybe the language in the book of Joshua, everybody got put to the sword and they completely destroyed this city or this kingdom or whatnot. Maybe it's really close to literal. Maybe there's a decent amount of hyperbole involved ultimately. You need to read the book of Joshua and see what you make of that for yourself. Now the second half of Joshua doesn't take as much time to cover because it's dominated by the dividing up of the land, the little Canaanite local kingdoms and the coalitions that have come together. They're all defeated and now you can sit down and attend with a great big map and spread it out and decide who's going to go where and that's exactly what we get is a vivid description of the boundaries of all of the land allocated to the effectively the sons of Jacob, the sons of Israel. And to you and me it's going to seem really boring but to the original audience this is a huge deal because one it's demonstrative of how completely the Canaanites were defeated. You have the run of the land. You can carve it up however you want at this point. Again, that seems pretty odious to modern sensibilities coming out of the age of colonialism. This is a different moral equation that while still complex you have to run with different variables in place. But that's where we're at. And so the original audience, they would have any compunction about this. They would have been like awesome. That's victory. We're no longer going to die as a people. They're going to get roots down. This is what it takes to stand the test of time instead of going extinct as a people group and to the very attentive reader they would have been like. This map scene is so exciting that dominates chapters 13 through 22 because it means that we can now kind of see a way that the massively exciting promises of God that we get way back earlier in the Old Testament might work out. There's got to be a people group here that has to stand the test of time. Now we can imagine a pathway that gets us there. But I also think that chapters 13 through 22 where the land gets all carved up would be very exciting because it demonstrates the fulfillment of the promised Abraham. How is this ragtag group of people for all that they've been through ever going to end up somewhere that they could put down roots and stand the test of time? Well, it was complicated. It involved a lot of wacky miraculous stuff and two partings of bodies of water and all kinds of other wild stuff. But dang, here we are. After all that, we get to the very end, Joshua is an old guy now and he gets everybody together. He's like, all right, we have got to leave this group with clarity on what the deal between them and God is. This is not a normal kingdom. God is king here and Israel must serve him to honor their side of the covenant if they want to keep this land and make it work. And in keeping with all of that, I think we get the most famous line from Joshua at the very end of the book in this scene, Joshua 24 14 moving forward. Joshua's talking to all the people now and he says, now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness. Put away the gods that your forefathers served beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the Lord. And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, chooses to stay whom you will serve, whether the gods your father served in the region beyond the river or the gods of the Amorites and whose land you dwell, but as for me in my house will serve the Lord. And then after Joshua says that the people are like, no, we're totally with you on that. And they set up a stone memorial to remember what they agreed to do right there. Then interesting side note, that theme of memorial keeps coming up throughout the book of Joshua because that's the seventh stone monument or memorial that has been put up. I think that's really one of the key themes just in general of Joshua, it's remember what God has done and pick the right stuff moving forward. Now in light of this call to remember the rest of the Old Testament is going to play out at times like a tragedy as God's people do not remember what happened and what was etched on those stones. When you visualize a book, Joshua picture Jericho's walls falling down. When you think about the theme, reflect on God establishing his flawed people in the promised land and how he becomes the king of those flawed people. And maybe if you want one more little bit of theme to reflect on, just boil it down to these two words. Remember and obey. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, check out Joshua six, which is the whole Jericho story and Joshua 24, which is the covenant renewal right at the very end. Nice job.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about judging. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. We are working our way through the entire Bible right now, one book per day until we're done. And today we're looking at judges. This is a doozy. This is a book that reminds me of the saying, don't meet your heroes. You've heard that cautionary remark, the truism. It just means that if you get too close to people you admire from afar, you see their humanity, you see their flaws without the Photoshop and the auto tune and the speech writers. And it can be pretty unflattering when you see your heroes in a true and unbiased light. Well, with judges, when I was a kid, I read through this book very much with the mindset of the heroes or whoever's on screen, a good guy, bad guy, comic book kind of reading. And as I've gone back to this book as an adult who's lived a little bit in the real world and who's read a little bit more Bible, I'm now able to better see how flawed pretty much literally every single character in this book is. The people are not the heroes, the people are the objects of redemption. They have problems. The God character is the hero and he is the one who appears in all the different stories. And he is the one who is choosing to redeem in spite of the behavior of run of the male people and oftentimes in spite of the very people who claim to love him and serve him. Judges represents the moment where we really spiral all the way down the toilet here in terms of what we see happening on screen. This is an awful story. And I guess I could just keep saying, Oh, it's bad. It's bad. It's bad. Or I can just tell you about it. The name of the book judges is derived from the office, I suppose you could call it, that the main characters of this book hold. They aren't like the kind of people who are enforcing a complex set of laws. I don't think any of these people are even elected. They're just regional leaders who can get a following and who all have massive character flaws, but God uses them to deliver his people, even though on paper they seem pretty undeserving of that deliverance. So judges, I mean, everybody forever who's commented on this book agrees that the structure is shaped like a spiral and probably a spiral pointing downward. You get a situation where the Israelite people that just don't do what they pledged they were going to do so boldly and so repeatedly, but the end of Joshua. Remember, Joshua was like, Hey, me and my house, we're going to serve the Lord. You ought to do the same. And they're all like, Yeah, for sure, we're going to, and I didn't say this when we were going through Joshua, but Joshua responds to that. Like you are testifying against yourselves right now. Tread lightly, my friends, because I don't think you're actually going to do that. And they're like, No, we're totally going to do it. And he's like, Are you though? because it seems like you don't and you're not going to do that. And they're like, we are totally going to do it. Let's carve a rock. And so then they carve a rock. And I guess that means that now they're going to do it, but they totally ignore the rock. So in judges, the narrative cycle is the people of God do bad stuff. They act like the Canaanites instead of acting different from the Canaanites. Then just like the deal that God made with Moses, I'm going to be your God, you're going to be my people and everybody's going to know it because if you obey me, I'm going to bless you. And if you disobey me, I'm going to punish you in keeping with that covenant. God lets different oppressors come along and put their boot on the neck of the Israelite people in different regions. And then eventually the Israelite people are really sad about it and they cry out to God and they're like, we're super sorry. Please help us deliver us from this oppressor. And then God preserving his own glory, preserving his own redemptive plan, preserving and honoring the unconditional covenant he made with Abraham delivers them. And then things are better for a period of time. So we get done with this prologue that explains why things are going to go south and then we get introduced to a series of different judges. Seven of the twelve judges get three verses of screen time or less. So you hear about Othnil, Shamgar, Tolah, Jair, Ibsan, Elon and Abdan only very briefly. But these other characters, Ehud, Deborah, Gideon, Jeptha and Samson get a lot of screen time comparatively. Now as first three judges, we don't get a sense of the complete moral mess here because the coverage is so succinct, but judges is very juicy at times. You can almost smell it if you read it closely enough. For example, the story of Ehud, the author goes out of his way to say that the king Ehud stabbed, was stabbed so well and so hard that he emptied his bowels when all of that happened. The story of Deborah ends with some guy's wife coaxing a fugitive king who was a former oppressor of Israel into a tent and she acts like she's going to be nice to him and as soon as she gets him to fall asleep with some delicious warm milk, she pounds a giant metal tent peg through his brain and then calls in the Israelites like there he is nailed to the ground. That's him right there. Pretty grizzly already and it feels a little bit morally icky and weird even in the early going, but then we meet Gideon. Gideon is a weak man who doesn't really believe God and wants to cover all of his bases before he'll take any risk or do anything. Still though, he obtains these great victories, but it goes right to his head. He becomes addicted to killing people and gets wildly murderous. And then in an episode that echoes, I mean really closely echoes that of the golden calf in Exodus at Mount Sinai. He collects a bunch of gold from the spoils of those he's defeated and he hasn't made into like a gold priest get up. They call it an ephod and Israel ends up worshiping that and it's an absolute embarrassment. Then there's this crude gang leader who lives way out in the hill country. Israel's being oppressed. They can't come up with anybody else to help him out after this cycle runs again. His name's Jeptha. So they come to him and they're like, well, will you be a gang leader on our behalf instead? And so Jeptha goes and defeats the Ammonites, but then he makes some weird vow and the weird vow is that he promises God that he's going to sacrifice whatever comes out of the house to meet him first if he's given victory over the Ammonites. Of course, it's going to be his daughter and surprise. It's his daughter. And so what we see there is that even this person who's supposed to be judge and leader over Israel has no idea how God is. That's the kind of oath you would make to a Canaanite God. And then it looks like he keeps that vow. Some people will try to come up with some very, very slippery way of being like, no, it was actually this other thing. But I think the folks who are reading it that way are frankly too concerned with trying to recast these judges as heroes when in fact, even the people who God uses to deliver the Israelites are really obviously, if we just take an objective, look at it very, very flawed and none more so than Samson whose story has echoes that move forward and backwards in the Bible. There's like a jillion points of story rhyming throughout the book of judges, but probably the greatest concentration of elements and motifs and themes that just sound like they're plucked from all these other parts of the Bible happens in the Samson story where we get a birth that echoes the miraculous births at the beginning of Luke, Elizabeth and Mary. And we get an ascension that looks almost like Jesus' ascension at the end of Luke beginning of Acts. But morally, it's absolute complete and total chaos. And then we get this little appendix, this bonus stuff at the end of the book between chapters 17 and 21 where there are two absolutely horrible incidents, including the one that opened my eyes to adult readings of the Bible, that being the story of Israel's civil war when through a series of events, a concubine ends up getting cut up into a whole bunch of pieces, then sent to all the different parts of Israel. I'm serious. And then all the different tribes come together and declare war against another tribe, but they overdo it and they make rash vows. And so to kind of undo, maybe they're over punishing of that tribe after God lets them suffer losses themselves for two days, almost as if to say like you have culpability here as well before I let you bring justice to the tribe that did this horrible thing. And when all of that is said and done, they've made so many mistakes and how they prosecute that punishment. And they've so unjustly executed their justice and judgment against this one tribe that they end up solving their problem by letting them abscond with other people's women, essentially making forced wives and slaves out of them is very disturbing from beginning to end. But it's not an even level of disturbing that toilet spiral analogy, I think is legit. In the end, the people of Israel only relatively small amount of time removed from the exodus and the conquest look just like the people they were supposed to replace. They have the values of the Canaanites. They think like Canaanites. They conceive of their God like a Canaanite God. And the result is the bloodshed and the madness and the chaos that the Canaanites had experienced. If God could be mocked, this would almost make a mockery of God and call into question his judgment, why would you replace the Canaanites for their wickedness with just this other version of identical wickedness? The last verse of the book of Judges is chapter 21 verse 25. In those days, there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes. Everything has gone off the rails. That system of moral thought, especially saturated in Canaanite thought it's not going to work. And so it begs for some kind of authority to step in and provide leadership. The people of Israel have rejected the theocracy. They don't want God as king. They want to chase after foreign gods and foreign values. And so now to keep them from destroying themselves and dismembering the redemptive plan that is the whole point here. Remember, it looks like a king is going to have to come on the scene. But as we're going to discover, kings come with all kinds of problems. And as we come to encounter these flawed kings, it will make us beg for the next thing that we need, which is a perfect benevolent king who never dies and never goes away and never gets replaced. It seems like that's kind of too much to ask for, but increasingly it's becoming clear. We need something like that to solve the problem of the human heart that we're encountering through these first seven books of the Bible. When you visualize the profoundly unfun book of Judges, picture Samson toppling that temple on top of everybody, it's just a glorious metaphor for the whole thing, judgment and mess all around there. When you think about the theme, reflect on Israel rejecting God. And really this just being a microcosm of the way humanity rejects God. Finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to check out Judges 216 through 19 because it kind of spells out who the judges are. Make sure to also check out judges 13 through 16. That's chapters 13 through 16 because you get the whole Samson story, which again, I think gives you a sense of the whole book and how each of these cycles with the judges works. And then finally, make sure to catch the very end. Judges 21 to 25 that little bit that I just read you. I guess we're going to call that a level up, but it's a dark level up. You know what isn't dark though? What we get next, Ruth is really, really good and the tone shift that we get going into Ruth next time around is so welcome after what we just went through with judges. So I'm excited about that.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Ruth. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. I don't remember who assigned it to me, but I had to read a book somewhere when I was in school called El Amor and Los Diempos de Colera, Love in the Time of Cholorettes by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I think a Colombian author. I don't remember everything about the story other than it's a very complex love story about attention, not just between people, but it's also about attention between eras, this romantic era of your, maybe set in the 19th century and looking backwards, coming into conflict with a new era, the era of modernity and progress. And as you can tell by the very compelling title, it's a story about very complicated love in very difficult times. This beautiful thing set against the backdrop of this very ugly thing. And that's kind of what you get with Ruth, except I like the love story more in Ruth. The opening line of the book of Ruth is in the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land and a man, it goes on to talk about some plot stuff we're going to talk about here in just a minute, but it sets it in the age of the judges. Were you here yesterday? When we talked about the judges, if you were, you might remember that that was not a happy time. It was worse than cholera. I don't know. I've never had cholera. I'm guessing it was worse than cholera. We're talking about north of 300 years that that book of judges covers and it's all nightmare. The characters who give us any hope or get anything even remotely right would be far and away. The worst characters in any other era of ever. The only reason they even kind of come off as useful is because they're being contrasted with the even horribler people and even horribler setting of this amoral debased wretched age. It's depressing to work through the book of judges. You get only the slightest glimmer of hope at the end when in the midst of a very condemnatory statement about society in this moment, it says, in those days, Israel had no king and everyone did as they saw fit in their own eyes, but that word king suggests that there might be an answer to this depravity, this disease that had deeply infected the heart of all people of all time, but particularly people here in the age of the judges. Maybe some kind of hope could come from real leadership, lasting leadership. That's what's teased to us as a possible solution at the end of judges. But now we're reading Ruth and right off the bat, we're told that this isn't happening after the era we just read about in judges. This is love in the time of cholera. This is all happening during the dark time, but despite being set in the era of the judges, Ruth feels different than judges. Right off the bat, we meet a family going through a hard time and they seem OK. There's a famine in the land. And so this family from Bethlehem in Judah, so Israelites, they go to Moab, the ancient enemies of the Israelite people. Remember, the Moabites were resistant to letting the Israelites pass through their turf when they were trying to get into Canaan way back in the day. So it's not a great relationship, but they go to Moab of all places. And there, this family, a dude, his two sons and his wife, they find love. The two sons marry Moabite women and then tragedy strikes again. It is the era of the judges and all the men in the family die. So now we got a weird situation. We're stuck in Moab, a foreign country. We have an Israelite mom from Bethlehem and she's got two daughters in law. What are you going to do with them? Well, she's like, I guess I just got to go home. That's my only option. One daughter-in-law is like, OK, well, I'd better stay put. But the other daughter-in-law, Ruth, is like, no way, I'm going with you. Wherever you go, I'm going there, whatever is your land, that's going to be my land to your people, my people, your God, my God. I'm with you, Mom. It's amazing. So refreshing. After everything we've been through in judges, here is character and decency and loyalty. And there's hope in that and it's refreshing. And so the first scene in the book of Ruth ends with these two unlikely traveling companions, Naomi and her daughter-in-law, Ruth, going back to Bethlehem to see what might happen. Scene number two happens as they arrive during the barley harvest. And there, Ruth goes out to glean in a field, according to some of the civil law that is back from the books of Moses that we looked at a while back. There were certain provisions for impoverished people, for widows that they could go and glean a little percentage of what was left behind when a harvest was happening as a built-in form of social welfare. And so Ruth goes out to glean in this particular barley field and whose field is it? Well, it turns out it's a family member. From Naomi's side of the family named Boaz. And we quickly find out that he is also decent. What in the world? We've met like three good people in a row after meeting roughly zero for 20 plus chapters in the era of the judges in the last book. And he's like, Hey, all you all, you make sure that you actually leave behind enough grain for this lady to collect it and don't mess with her. That's awesome. Well, between scene two and scene three of this story, we discover that Boaz isn't just a family member of Naomi. He is positioned to be the kinsman redeemer for Naomi's family. This is a complicated idea. We don't have a neat analog of this in modern society, but back then the fortunes of a family had to do with producing heirs and keeping property and livestock within that family. That's why you get the pickiness about intermarriage and so forth with the Canaanites back in Joshua and the Pentateuch. It's not some kind of racial superiority thing. It's really until very, very recently in the era of marrying for love. This is how title and land and ownership and generational growth as a family occurred. And it was by bloodlines. And so this stuff was really important and whose kid was actually whose kid was really important as well. We got to remember that when we look at a lot of the sexual family, parentage, property rules that existed in ancient times like what we're getting here in Ruth. Well, there was this cultural practice that existed by which the nearest relative of a family member who had experienced a tragedy like what Naomi and Ruth had experienced would engage in some sort of marriage. Now my impression is for a lot of the time back here, this would not result in literal plural marriage if somebody was already married and they were a kinsman, redeemer. They would just effectively take responsibility for the household that was abandoned or orphaned or whatever you want to call it, widowed and would rope their estate into the family estate again to make sure that that land was not lost and to make sure that everybody who was on their own was no longer on their own and was provided for. But if somebody wasn't married at all, they could just straight up marry a widow left behind by someone in their family who had died. In other words, this kinsman redeemer thing is about taking what looks like total despair and flipping it around to something that has hope. So it would be very easy for you and I as modern readers to listen to this unfold between scene two and scene three of Ruth and be like, oh, that sounds icky and gross. But if we think of it in light of how the original audience would have heard it, they would have seen the beauty in this. They would have seen the, wow, that's amazing that this is all coming together the way it is there's a real chance things are going to work out for these two ladies that they will get justice that they will get cared that things will be all right for them. Well, what's going to happen next in scene three? And I only is like, look, hey, you got to quit acting like you're a woman in mourning and you have to find a way that makes cultural sense in this era in Bethlehem to communicate to Boaz that you are available. And there's this very tender scene with some kind of tradition that I don't understand where she goes to him in the night. It looks like there are a lot of people there all kind of crashed out sleeping and she's there. And essentially the invitation is would you extend like the end of your garment, the end of your, your blanket, if you will, over part of me? And I've heard some people suggest that this is a euphemism for some sort of active physical intimacy. I suppose it could be, but because that physical intimacy seems to happen a little bit later on in the story after they are actually married spoilers. I tend to think that this is some sort of symbolic gesture, this whole laying at his feet and being received by him in this way. The fourth scene has Boaz going out to the city where the business happens. And like you got to give notice in the paper back in the day in the legal section. You remember those almost like that happens at the city gates and Boaz is like, hey, I'm going to marry Ruth and redeem this part of my family on behalf of my deceased family members as long as that makes sense to everybody. Well, it turns out there's somebody who is a little more closely related and they talk about it. And the guys like, well, I probably ought to do the redeeming then. But then when he realizes that it's not just a property deal, but you're also going to be marrying this lady for whatever reason, that did not work for his current situation. And it made more sense for Boaz to do the redeeming, which means that God was faithful. And it means that something beautiful happened against this horrible, hopeless backdrop. It means that something came out of what looks like basically nothing to create something beautiful, but in the final little epilogue we discover that it's not just something beautiful for these people, but there's a hint that it's something beautiful for maybe more, maybe everybody, because we learn that the little baby that comes from Ruth and Boaz is named Obed. And we learn in the final phrase of Ruth that Obed fathered a man named Jesse and Jesse fathered King David. Now, the text doesn't use the word king there because it assumes the original audience would know exactly that David was a king. But I drop that bonus descriptor of David because look at this, judges ends with the term king as the slight little glimmer of hope. It's going to take something like this to get things straightened out and Ruth is ending on the same note. Now look, we have got pages and pages and pages of dumpster fires loaded on the back of trains and collided into each other dumpster fire train wrecks. That's what we got going for so much of what we have ahead of us. But there is this through line even through the darkest days, the days of the judges, the days of warring, the days of cholera metaphorically speaking, that gives us this sense of hope. And even that name Jesse, as we work a little bit forward in the Bible, we're going to come across a prophet who talks about this whole line, this whole redemptive project being a burnout stomp. It's wrecked. Nothing that's ever going to come from it. But there's this little shoot, this little image of a little tiny green stick that comes out of the burned out stump of Jesse. And that little shoot is what will produce the Messiah, this theme of something beautiful and redemptive happening against the backdrop of deepest darkness runs all the way through the Bible, but in addition to appreciating it for the grand role that the book of Ruth plays in the grand redemptive picture and big narrative of the Bible, I think it also has to be appreciated for the tonal break we get from what we've had everywhere else. I think we also have to stop and appreciate it for getting a really good look at a woman on screen and a woman of character for that matter, just a person of character. When you think about Ruth, obviously picture the main characters Ruth and Boas when you visualize the whole thing. Let's picture that awesome moment where Boas makes the fateful decision to spread his garment over Ruth when you think about the theme reflect on hope born out of love and faithfulness so much so that faithfulness. And hopefully you can just make time to read the whole thing, but for some reason you can't make sure to at least catch the first chapter. Alright, level up on the book. Awesome.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about 1 Samuel. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Today we're looking at 1 Samuel, and I would like to begin by complaining. My complaint is this. The Bible is really good, and there's so much interesting stuff here, and I want to talk about all of it. The literature side, narrative, the history, the character arcs, all the connections with different stuff in the Bible. It's so good. I'm reading all of these books at least once before I make the episode, and this is already having such a profound effect on me. I just love it. I hope you're reading along as well and getting in as much Bible as you can as we do this, but I'm going to stick to my guns one book per day, which means I need to get to talking about 1 Samuel. 1 Samuel is a two-part book. Think of 1 Samuel like a premium streaming TV season, a high-drama, deep dive character, a lot of violence in that kind of show, and it has kind of a first half to the season and a second half. There's like a mid-season finale, and that is where the artificial, after the fact break, was inserted that creates a 1 Samuel. Originally, this was probably just one singular document that had to be cut into to accommodate scroll lengths or media styles and size or whatever way back in the day. So you might expect that that break between first and second Samuel is just going to be clumsy, like cut it the halfway point, whatever. I think it's very well positioned at this high-drama moment. At the end of first Samuel, the screen feels like it just wants to fade to black, roll the credits. As you get your hands on your head and you're like, no way did that just happen. Where does this go from here? And then you're all amped up to get into second Samuel and find out how this drama is going to unfold. Well, for one of these premium streaming TV shows to work, you got to have it set in a high stakes, high tension, high-drama moment in history, environment, and for Samuel, absolutely nails it on that. This is set at the end of the era of the judges, the 300-ish year-long nightmare where the people of Israel revert to some kind of primal savagery that is an embarrassment and a disgrace and takes us to places of darkness. You and I might not even be able to invent. But yesterday, we see the little glimmer of Hope book between judges and first Samuel, and that's Ruth, where a Hebrew man from Bethlehem falls in love with and marries an outsider, a Gentile woman from Moab, age-old enemies of Israel. And through them, we discovered that there's going to be this family line, this little branch off of the Abraham family tree that's going to produce King David. Things are starting to come into focus. Tell me more about where this is going. Is it okay for me to get my hopes up? And that's where the 12-episode season of First and Second Samuel picks up. And what we get right off the bat is the introduction of the character for whom the book is named. There's this lady. Her name is Hannah. She can't have kids, and she's sad about that. And she prays to God and interacts with the priest Eli. And she's assured you're going to have a kid, and she does have a kid. And the kid is Samuel, and she dedicates Samuel to the service of the Lord. So he's going to be nurtured and mentored by Eli, the priest. And then Hannah composes this beautiful song that is as rich theologically as anything in the entire Bible that communicates as much about the grand redemptive plan and narrative through line as anything in the Bible. My heart exalts the Lord. My horn is exalted in the Lord. My mouth derides my enemies because I rejoice in your salvation. There is none holy like the Lord, for there is none besides you. There is no rock like our God. And there's so much more, but these are only ten-ish minute episodes. Go read First Samuel 2 if you read nothing else from this book. We get to know Samuel a little bit and what we discover is that his mentors kids are idiots and that God is effectively going to depose Eli's line as stewards of the priesthood. And Samuel is going to take their place as a priest, but also functionally is kind of like the last legitimate or good judge. So what we're seeing here is the introduction of this theme of deposition of deposing failed leadership and putting new leadership in place on the human side, but that's contrasted with the tragedy that unfolds in First Samuel of God's chosen people kind of deposing their true king and replacing him with somebody who will ultimately turn out to be a failed human king. The rest of the opening chunk of First Samuel rounds out with the Philistines capturing the arc of the covenant, emblematic or maybe literally the place where God dwells among his people and they try to take it back into Philistine territory and it does not go well and they end up just being like fine, take it back, take it back, which rounds out a very interesting prologue on the note of, hey, the Israelite people, like you had God leading you. He's powerful. He's in your midst. But nonetheless, they want a king like everybody else has. And part of what gets them there is yet another failed bit of leadership. Samuel gets old and he makes the same mistake he does. He takes his kids and he's like, I'll just have you judge Israel then. But they're idiots too. And apparently they're so unjust and willing to receive bribes. They're like, forget it. We're done with this dumb system. The people of Israel, like we just want a king, but we did the theocracy model. It isn't working. We don't like how it's going. Not a lot of personal responsibility or awareness there on their part. They demanded King Samuels like Okey Dokey, but here's how kings are. And wow, do I resonate with the stuff that Samuel warns them about in terms of what kings are going to do, really what human governments are going to do in first Samuel eight. If you want to read something else interesting, go get that first Samuel eight, 10 through, what is it, 18? It's pretty prescient, pretty potent. Well, Saul is the guy who gets picked. He's huge. He's a big monstrous, tall, gigantic man. And he's got a lot of promise. He's bashful and it's not totally clear that he wants the job, but he gets roped into it. And at first, seems like he's going to do all right. He does the stuff that God wants him to do. He defeats some enemies that didn't get defeated or resolved during the era of the conquest or the judges. And it looks like we're finally going to fix some of the stuff that was still wrong so that we can see these people be what they were supposed to be. But as meteoric as Saul's rise was, so is his decline. He gets something wrong that on the surface seems really ticky tack. Like seriously, why are people so bent out of shape about this? But ultimately it comes out that, yeah, indeed it was pride and selfishness that made him do the things that he did that were in opposition to what God had told him to do. And Samuel was like, okay, well, that's God has rejected you as king, Saul. And so following the guidance of the Lord, Samuel, now a very old man, goes out and defines the household of Jesse. And there he meets all of Jesse's very impressive older sons. He gets told like, nope, it's none of these. Those aren't the one. And famously, Samuel's like, you got anybody else? You have any other kids? And Jesse's like, I got my youngest one out there. And sure enough, that's who God picked. And probably the most famous verse in all of first Samuel happens in chapter 16 in the context of David getting picked. Samuel sees one of the brothers like it's got to be that guy. But God says to Samuel, don't look on his appearance or on the height of his stature because I have rejected him for the Lord sees not as man sees man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. And I think that verse is beloved because it's just a nice lesson in general. It rings true and pure, but also that theme plays out. And just as Abraham is praises, you know, he believed God and that was credited to him as righteousness. So David's big thing, like some of you have been through the Bible, you know this up the top of your head, like his superpower is he was a man after God's own heart. So you can see how that theme that was introduced in that verse. I just read his advance there. Well, famously David defeats Goliath and he skyrockets to prominence. Saul gets really uncomfortable with that. Becomes very insecure and threatened. David has a good friendship with Saul's son Jonathan, who's always got David's back at court. And that's a good thing or Saul would have killed him because he's threatened by all the David's accomplished. And also David is now the Lord's anointed. God has rejected Saul as king. David is anointed to be the future king. But we got this weird friction where they're together, but David keeps treating Saul well and following his leadership as a weird conundrum. Most of the rest of first Samuel has David on the run out in the desert, Saul trying to kill him with spears and multiple times David has the opportunity to kill Saul, but he doesn't do it because he won't raise his hand against the Lord's anointed. At every turn, Saul demonstrates low character as he spirals into madness. Then at pretty much every turn, David demonstrates shrewdness and savvy and innocence. And in the end, Saul's bad leadership, Saul's bad decision making catches up with him. He loses in battle to his lifelong enemy, the Philistines, and he falls on his own sword. And that's where the mid-season finale of first and second Samuel goes to credits. So we leave first Samuel wondering if David's going to be able to take hold of the throne. And if so, is he going to be any good as a king? Is it through him that some kind of redemption is going to happen? Or is this whole thing just going to spiral back into madness now that this one king is gone? And we will have found ourselves making no progress toward redemption whatsoever. We're going to find out more about that next time around. Second Samuel, Matt is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Hey everybody, it's Matt, and right up the top to any dancer question that a lot of you have been asking me, and that is, who's a lady with the pretty voice at the beginning of the thing? And says stuff about this 10 Minute Bible Hour going to do the thing. Is that your wife? Yep, that's my wife. That's Camilla. She did that, and I do think she has a lovely voice, and I'm super grateful that she would grace my podcast with it. So I thought that was awesome. Thanks for asking about it. Last time around, we finished the mid-season finale of this dramatic series that, you know, in the Bible, they call first and second Samuel, but that really is just one season. It's just one book. It's just Samuel, but it had to get split in two. And as we discussed yesterday, they split it at a really good place, pacing wise, because we come away with all of these questions. What's going to happen now that Saul, the first king of Israel, who looked pretty good at first and then totally went off the rails and his insecurity and his anger and his temper and his rage. Now that he's dead by sort of his own hand, what do you call it when somebody falls on their own sword? By his own sword, now that he's dead, what's going to happen is what's left of his household going to grab the throne? That would be problematic because Samuel, the other big character in this book, he anointed David, God picked David, and David has done pretty much everything right in first Samuel. It seems like he's the rightful king, but they're going to be people who are loyal to Saul, who are not going to want that. So what's going to happen in second Samuel? What's going to happen in the dramatic second half and final conclusion of this metaphorical premium television season here that we're calling first and second Samuel? The answer to that question is going to determine so much about where history is about to go coming out of this story. Well, as we suspected, there is immediately resistance to the idea of David becoming king because we're talking about the Bible or any other time in history, those vacuums in power, they don't just sit there and almost never. Does everybody see a scramble for power and then the guy in charge is dead and was like, guys, be calm. I know lots of people have legitimate claims they feel to the throne, but let's just go with that guy. That would be right. It's not usually what you get there exceptions, but this is not going to be one. Saul's household and Saul's allies, they are going to rally around their people to try to keep the throne in some sort of dynasty. It's going to take a little cobbling together in the name of Saul and they're going to resist David. And so very quickly, these sides start to take shape. But even as a civil war is looming and it's pretty obvious this is going to happen in chapter one, David's first response is not to go and gear up for war. His first response is to grieve the death of Saul and David uses one of his superpowers, which is the composition of verse, poetry, music to write this beautiful lament in memory and out of respect for Saul. And that's at the end of second Samuel chapter one. If you're only going to read a few things from this book, that would be my second biggest recommendation. If you're only going to read one thing from this book, we're going to get to what that is in just a minute. Well, those good vibes are over pretty quickly, not that David just becomes a bloodthirsty jerk. But after that, he looks to God and he's like, all right, well, where should I go next? What do I do? Because it's a wide open road. You don't have a really a throne anywhere. You don't have the tribes of Israel really rallied fully around anyone. It looks like one of those deals where somebody's probably just going to stick a crown on somebody's head. And we'll just see if maybe people follow them. That's an age old technique that persists to this day to deciding controversial successions of power. Well, even though when you think about the lineage of kings in what's called the unified kingdom of Israel here in the early days of the kingdom, you usually think, oh, Saul went first and then David, but there was a guy in between who kind of counts as king, even though he didn't have the support of everyone. And his name is Ish Busheth and he is the son of Saul. He's a 40 year old dude and he's going to make this claim with Abner, the guy who's the military leader in her Saul propping him up. Well, in the early going, it looks like Abner, who represents how Saul is going to try to work out some kind of trial by champions deal with Joab, who is the sworn sword of house David. And they get out like 20 champions, think Knights. And they're like, all right, we're just going to have them all fight, see what happens. And the description of the battle is really sad. It's like they all just grabbed each other with the one hand and then with their stab in hand, they all stabbed each other in the side. And pretty much everybody died. And it seems like this is a metaphor for how foolish and escalating and unnecessary all of this is. And it's kind of a throwback to that stuff that Samuel was saying when he was still alive in first Samuel, about like, sure, you all want a king because it's going to get ugly. If we do the king thing and they're like, yeah, we totally want the king. Okie dokie. Here you go. You get a king now. Well, this is the aftermath of that war is ugly. And that is exactly what we get in the ensuing chapters of second Samuel. There's murder. There's violence. There's lack of mercy. Eventually long story short, David wins and he manages to unify all of the different tribes. Ishbeshath is dead and out of the picture. Abner eventually dies. He's out of the picture. And once David has restored some kind of sanity to the situation and everybody is finally at least somewhat unified and in healing mode again, he decides that Jerusalem is going to be the city that he governs from. Despite all the conquering and all that everything else has been going on here, there are still Jebusites who occupy Jerusalem. And so David has to go and take Jerusalem in order to govern from there. He does. He names the city Zion and David brings the Ark of the Covenant, the presence of God. As you recall, the Israelites have the Ark back and now the Ark is moving to Jerusalem. And once it's there, David's like, all right, God, I think that what we need to do is build you a house, not a tent, but a permanent place to dwell among your people. And in maybe the most important passage in the entire Old Testament, it's top five, maybe in the whole Bible. Second Samuel chapter seven, go read this thing. We get a promise from God, a covenant from God. We haven't seen one of these for a while, right? That is made between him and David. Now we get the covenant between God and Abraham. I'm going to make you a people. You're going to have this land. You're going to be blessed and the nations are going to be blessed through you. Interesting that we get the covenant with Moses. That one's a lot more conditional. I'm going to be your God. You're going to be my people. All the nations are going to know that's the case because if you bless me, I'm going to bless you. And if you disobey me, I'm going to punish you. Well, now this Davidic promise is another unconditional one like the deal with Abraham. God's like, no, I'm going to have one of your offspring build me a house and that's going to be awesome. Thank you for offering. What we're going to do instead is I'm going to build something for you. And it's an eternal throne, an eternal kingdom with a great king who will one day come from your line and sit on this throne. Now, look, if you've been paying attention to what's been going on through all these books we've looked at so far, the sounds like a through line all the way back to that initial promise that God oddly makes to the snake. He tells the serpent, somebody's going to come along. You're going to strike at his heel, but he's going to crush your head. Amalamatic of the destruction of the curse that the serpent helped to initiate in the garden and that God is going about redeeming. We figured out that that character is going to come out of the line of Abraham and then we started to get some hints at that redeemer, that snake crusher, that defeater of the curse was going to come out of the descendant of Abraham named Judah, despite all of Judah's weird flaws. And Ruth, the previous book, at least tonally, gave us a pretty big hint that that redeemer was going to come out of the line of Ruth and Boaz. And indeed, now we're seeing that is going to be the case. There's language in this interaction between God and David that is about this eternal Messiah and this eternal throne. There's also language in here about Solomon and what's going to happen next. So you got to read it carefully, but it's there. I mean, it's all over it. Check out 2 Samuel 7. Well, now things are just going great. For the most part, David's made pretty good decisions, maybe a little erratic or inexplicable here or there, but he's a man after God's own heart. And he's still a man after God's own heart after what happens next, but it's a tough run for him and the people who he mistreats, including a woman named Bathsheba. Caesar bathing on the roof, he lusts for her. The king gets what the king wants. She becomes pregnant. And then David doubles down on his mistake by using some shoddy military tactics to make sure her very loyal, faithful husband, Uriah, is killed in battle. What God through his prophet calls David on this. David to his credit immediately repents. I mean, what else can you do at this point, but just own the mistake. And David has to endure painful consequences for what went wrong, including painful consequences within his own household as his kids and his extended family start to do really stupid, destructive things. David's son, Amnon, falls in love with his step sister and takes advantage of her. I'm using euphemisms. I understand that what he did was worse than takes advantage of. And then Tamar's full brother, Absalom, understandably once revenge. And so he orchestrates the murder of Amnon. That's kind of a family incident at this point. And somehow that just opens Pandora's box and now Absalom goes into full on revolt and tries to overthrow and displace his father, David. And in this ugly heartbreaking turn of events, David has to flee again. He's on the run. Surely he thought those days were behind him. David struggles to mount a defense against his own son. Absalom manages to take control of Jerusalem and govern from there. But then Absalom, who must have had amazing hair, is killed in a very memorable scene in 2 Samuel 18 when he's riding a donkey. But he rides it under some branches, like something out of the dukes, a hazard, instead of just getting knocked off his mule, his hair gets stuck in there. And that of course leaves him as a sitting duck for David's men and they kill him. Then through an ugly, drawn out, violent, up and down process, David is ultimately reestablished as king and reigns out through the rest of his days and is even able to pass on the throne to his son Solomon, who we're going to talk about more later on. But in all of that, we get kind of an odd season finale between chapters 21 and 24 of 2 Samuel, because we get a bunch of details here that seem to be out of order in terms of the timeline. It seems like what the author of Samuel is going for here is to communicate the mixed baggiveness of this whole affair with David. It's the Lord's anointed. He's a man after God's own heart. Every time he deviated from what God wanted him to do, he made absolute messes. And so what we see is both the beauty and the tragedy in the anecdotes included in these last few chapters. We see again David's artistry on display and his heart for the Lord. And then the final anecdote is David falling into a place of sin once again where he counts on his own strength by taking a census. God didn't want him to take and then realizes he was wrong and humbles himself before God again, but not until a very significant punishment has been leveled against all of Israel. What we see coming out of the dramatic premium TV style season that is first and second Samuel is a clear promise that God is still in on the redemptive plan and an unconditional promise that no matter how much David messes things up, God is going to establish this eternal kingdom with this eternal king who's going to reign forever and descend from David. So we come away feeling the frailty of humanity and the inability of humanity to get things right on their own. We come away with an answer to our question. Will kings solve everything coming out of the air of the judges? Nope, they will not. But we can take hope in that God has promised that one day there will be a king and that king is going to straighten things out. We're all curious about when that king is going to show up and what it's going to look like and we'll move forward in the story more on that in First Kings next time around. I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about first Kings. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is a 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. I want to start with a thought exercise here. Let's imagine that the United States was founded a hundred years before it actually was, if you like a dinner party or something where you get together and listen to podcasts, and you want to impress everybody, you just blurt out what that year would be now. Your window for impressing people has now closed. So we're going to say the United States started in 1676 for this exercise. And now we're going to imagine that right now, as you're listening to this, we're going to decide to write a summary and an evaluation of all the people who ever served as presidents of the United States. Well, there's a couple of obvious questions. We got a tackle before we put pen to paper here, right? And number one, how much detail are we going to go into? How long is this book going to be? And well, let's say we're going to keep it pretty succinct. So we're not going to be able to get into lots of detail on these guys' lives because we're more interested in how good a job they did, which leads to question number two. Wow, good a job they did based on what criteria. I suppose there are a lot of different ways that we could evaluate that, but we've got to come up with criteria that transcends these 400 years stuff that would apply equally to everybody. So we're going to go big picture. And these are the three questions that in this exercise, we're going to evaluate based on number one, were they loyal to the United States of America? Or were they loyal to some other nation or were they bribable, corruptible, were they just loyal to themselves, some kind of political mercenary? We're going to gauge them on that number two, were they just toward their subjects? Did they care about the people they governed? Did they serve the people they governed? And number three, did they stick to the ground rules to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the civil liberty principles upon which the whole country was founded? Or did they just blow past all of that stuff to do whatever they were going to do? Now, maybe some of you were already starting to feel it right now. And you're like, ah, I'm uncomfortable though, because who's writing this book? Is it going to be somebody from a political persuasion that I don't like? Because they're going to get the evaluation all wrong. It's going to be stupid. Look, I can't speak to that part. And I'm not going to get into like who's right and who's wrong. I don't know. Okay. I know that was a lot, but we finally just got to where I wanted to be. If all of that made sense, then first and second Kings are going to make a ton of sense as well. Just like first and second Samuel, they're one book that gets divided up because of scroll length and other questions about the media on which they were written down and transmitted. We don't know who wrote these two books. Some people think it was Jeremiah, maybe Ezra. I'm not sure it's very important that it be one person or a well-known name. But even if somebody wanted to vigorously make the case and now I was written by this one big name character, that one big name character, you would still have to acknowledge because of evidence internal to the text that there were other contributors and that that author or editor was drawing on some old sources, older stuff that was written down. Because again, we're covering like 400 years here, think about what you were doing 400 years ago. This is a big swath of time that has to be taken into account here and it makes sense that there might be more than one contributor to this whole thing. But in terms of what the project is, it's just like the one that you and I were talking about someone coming from a very specific set of assumptions, a very specific angle is setting out to give us the story of Judah and eventually Israel. There's a split that happens early on here that we're going to talk about in just a second. But this somebody is trying to give us a big overview of the history of this era of God's chosen people using the reign of each of the kings as a benchmark, as a storytelling tool to walk us through it. And we know that this someone has an angle because we can detect it in the pages and that angle is that they seem very persuaded by what they read in the first five books of the Old Testament, particularly Deuteronomy. There's a bunch of nods to Deuteronomy in first and second kings. And if you recall from when we were just working on the book of Deuteronomy a few days ago, it centers around this second giving of the law. The old generation wandered around in the desert and they don't get to go in to Canaan, but the new generation is ready to go in and take Canaan and old man Moses lays it all out again, like, here, this is what you got to do. This is what the law says. This is what God wants. This is what the covenant is and then he renews the covenant with this new generation before they follow Joshua into the promised land. And as we've already talked about so many times, what is that covenant? Well, the one that God made with Moses is I'm going to be your God. You're going to be my people and everybody's going to know that I'm your God and you're my people because when you obey me, I'm going to bless you. And when you disobey me, I'm going to punish you. So whoever is putting together first and second Kings is really into that and is trying to stress to some future generations of Israelite, of Jewish people, hey, look back at our history and look at it through the lenses of what God did before we even had a land. Look at it through the lenses of the law and the covenant that God made. Look at how much we blew it. Look at how our leaders did not handle their business overwhelmingly correctly and look at what that cost us, which ultimately is going to be the wholesale defeat of God's chosen people and then being hauled off into captivity. That's where first and second Kings are going to end. So then the structure of the book is real straightforward. It's just like the one that you and I imagined putting together for all of the hypothetical presidents of a 400 year old hypothetical United States of America. We get introduced to a king either of the southern kingdom or northern kingdom again, more on that in a minute. Then we get told either very little about what they did or a great deal about what they did and we just see an evaluation based on three criteria. Number one was the king loyal to God and God alone. Number two, did the king promote the worship of God and God alone amongst his people or did the king allow idolatry to run rampant and finally did that king honor the law of God? Was he committed to the deal that God made with Moses, did he honor God and keep his commands? Over the course of first and second Kings, depending on how you count it all, we're going to see roughly 40 Kings evaluated in this manner. Now, maybe at this point you're like, hey, well, when do we get the summary? Because the summaries are kind of fun. Well, the answer to your question, my friend is right now is when you get the summary. It opens with David is an old man picking up right where we left off in second Samuel and just like those last four cryptic chapters of second Samuel where we see the good stuff about David and the bad stuff about David, so we get the same thing at the beginning of first Kings. It is clear that Solomon is going to win out and he is going to sit on his father's throne and much like old man Moses making his parting words to his people and old man Joshua making his parting words to his people that they should follow God and be faithful and loyal to him. So old man David does the same thing with Solomon except then right after he gets to his father's and saying all that beautiful stuff, old man David's like also, there's some murder and that still needs to be done. I got some people or I don't feel like we've squared up account to keep an eye on them. They're trouble. I'm telling you kid. They're trouble. It'd be better if you could go ahead and make sure that they die, you know, die. And so Solomon follows through on these weird grudges and this bizarre hit list he gets from David at the end of his life and opens his reign with a bunch of assassinations. You ever heard of that sword of Damocles principle? This is another tradition. This is Greek, but it's a story. I think it comes from the island of Syracuse. I could be wrong on that. But it's a story about this sword that is hung by a little single thread of horse hair over somebody who imagines that they could rule better than the king. And pretty quickly the guys like, I don't want to rule. I don't want to rule. Take me out from under this sword and the sword is a metaphor for all of the ick that one has to engage in to achieve that kind of power to obtain the throne in the first place. And then it prevents one from ruling with a clear mind and ruling with a clean heart because you got all that stuff in the rear view mirror. Well, that's sort of Damocles principle, which again, it's like it's not in the Bible. The idea comes through. It really plays out with how things work for Solomon. Solomon initially looks like he makes some pretty not wise decisions in keeping with his dad's advice. But then God shows up and was like, Hey, what do you want? And Solomon's like, I want to be better fit for this job. It's clear that a big part of what I'm doing here paraphrases mine. It involves judgment and trying to get justice right. And based on what Solomon asks, he apparently doesn't feel totally equipped for that. He's like, I want wisdom. And God's like, cool. I really, really like that that's what you asked for instead of superpowers or long life again. Paraphrase is totally mine. And so he grants Solomon this amazing wisdom. And that's quickly demonstrated in a famous decision that he makes about a dispute over who is the true mother of a child. And then shortly thereafter, God sees through the promise that was made to Solomon's father, David, about building this temple. And Solomon indeed sees through the construction of this magnificent temple. And this is one of the places where we see the Deuteronomy connections or really the Pentateuch connections in general. There's a massive aside here where it spells out all kinds of details like right down to a couple of pillars that even get given first names in terms of how the temple was built, the business dealings behind it, all of the materials that were used, the dimensions, the artwork. It's beautiful. It's fascinating. I don't know if we get any other accounts. This detailed of any ancient buildings off the top of my head. This one is amazing and much like God's presence physically shows up at the dedication, the completion of the tabernacle back in the day. So God's spirit shows up at the end of this massive elaborate sacrificial public festival at the dedication of the temple. The text holds out God as being straight up in that temple dwelling among his people. So that's kind of a big deal. Seems like things are going well, but much like last time I said something like that in a previous episode, then things start going not well. Then Solomon falls for a bunch of women who worship other gods and he wobbles in his dedication to the God that he just built this amazing temple for. There's a judgment pronounced against Solomon at the end, I believe, of chapter 11. And then at the beginning of, I think, chapter 12, the son of Solomon, Reabom, he wrecks everything. I mean, he doesn't even get out of the gate. And he's like, okay, how should I reign? I know with an iron fist and then all of the tribes of the north are like, nah, they were just not doing it. And they leave. They bail completely. And now there are two kingdoms, Judah in the south and Israel in the north in the south. Jerusalem continues to be the main hub religiously and politically in the north. There are a few different religious and political centers, but there's some weird stuff that goes on up there that looks like idolatry. And that just sets the tone for how the reigns of the kings of the north go. It's ugly, perhaps none uglier than King Ahab and his wife Jezebel, who are murderous and occasionally try to exploit God when it's helpful for them. But mostly they just chase after dark stuff. And it's in the context of their reign that we meet the first rock star prophet that we've seen in a long time. In a way, this is the guy who introduces us to a whole new era of prophets. These are the prophets who speak into the era of the kings. And his name is Elijah. And eventually we get to know that he has a successor named Elijah, more on that when we get into second kings. But in first Kings, Elijah has a showdown with Ahab, the king of the north's beloved prophets of Baal. And God shows up and Baal doesn't show up. Baal's a local Canaanite deity. And God looks awesome. Elijah looks awesome. And the Abb ends up looking like an idiot. And first Kings ends with a bunch of the prophecies of doom pronounced by Elijah against Ahab and Jezebel coming to pass their reign ending and a new rhythm being established from a literary perspective that we're going to carry with us into second Kings where you've got these questionable rulers, most of whom turn out to be a total flop. All of the northern Kings in fact fail that threefold test that I brought up a little bit earlier. But this new structure that we see is we get an account of how those Kings fail or occasionally in the south get it right. And their prophets, they're speaking into the situation. And then of course, as we get further into the Old Testament, we're going to reconnect with some of those prophets as we get some of what they had to say set against the historical backdrop that we're reading about in first and second Kings. What does that mean for God's promise to redeem everything and establish this king and this kingdom, all the things he promised to David and Abraham, well, we'll turn the page into second Kings. We'll see how this thing plays out and we'll try to get a better sense of it from there. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Second Kings. [\"The Second Kings\"] Hey my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and we were looking at Second Kings this time around, which isn't even really the sequel to First Kings. It's just all kings. It's one thing. There is no sequel here. So when you read the end of First Kings, and then you turn the page over to the beginning of Second Kings, it just keeps rolling. You would never know if you would just put it all together with text because it is one book divided after the fact. Now like we talked about last time, this isn't just a history book, this is a history book with a very clear purpose, and that purpose, as it is being written from somewhere in the middle of the 500s BC, probably from Persia, is to address the remnant, the people who were taken away into captivity, the Israelite people, the Jewish people, and to hold a light up to all of the history of what went wrong, to remind whoever was reading this in the 500s BC of how we got here. Why are we Persian captives again? Why don't we just continue to live where our ancestors lived and worship where our ancestors worshiped? How did this go so badly off the rails when we get our answers in First and Second Kings? Which start very promisingly with David, yeah, he's old and he's getting close to dying, but he's saying things to his son Solomon and First Kings about, hey, you gotta be loyal to God and obey the commands like all the stuff that you would want. It looks like he would pass the evaluative test and Solomon's like, okay, all right. But then David at the end of that expression of bedside wishes is also like, hey, make sure to kill some people and engage in a lot of political intrigue toward these enemies. They can't be trusted. And that kind of sets the tone for where everything goes from there. This ends up through First and Second Kings not looking like a people set apart from God. They just look like everybody else. And maybe that's the biggest disappointment in all of it. They're fickle religiously like everybody else. They engage in bloodshed like everybody else. They have slaves like everybody else. They're not good at the peaceful transfer of power like everybody else and just like everybody else in the end, they're groveling at the table of the big empires for whatever little political scraps they might be willing to throw them. So it's kind of sad, a little bit pathetic. Certainly you come away with the feeling this is a squandered potential kind of situation, even reading it all these years later. How much more so must the original audience reading this in Persia have felt that emotion. Ah, we blew it. Tell us again how exactly we got this wrong. And then I think we can intuit from there what it would look like to get it right next time, which would be just do the opposite of what all of the kings who failed the test did. So Second Kings picks up with the death of Ahab. And then we just start this list of king after king, after king, we get details specific to each one of them or almost all of them about exactly how they got things wrong. So often you add him credit, they're really very creative in terms of how they get it wrong. But Old Man, Elijah passes along his authority, his mantle, if you will, of profit to young man, Alisha. And the contrast between Alisha and the kings he communicates with is fantastic. The impotence and small thinking that's on display with all of these kings were supposed to be the most powerful, the sovereign of the land. It looks so pitiful, contrasted with the power that God has vested in Alisha and the stability of the passing on of authority from Elijah to Alisha, contrasted with the inability to hand off power cleanly from one ruler to the next in Israel, I think speaks volumes as well. And ultimately Israel spirals so far out of control making stupid international treaties and deals all in direct opposition to the prophets who God keeps sending them. It results in them running afoul of the worst people we've ever encountered in all of the history of the Bible up to this point. That's Assyria, they're monsters. They are a mean evil empire. And this is an important little historical side note here. When you think of the spectrum of evil Bible empires in the Old Testament, they're big, like the big massive ones, think of it this way. Assyria is all the way on the end of the spectrum toward awful. They're just monsters and I wanna get into it, but you can Google that stuff and find out for yourself exactly what the deal is. Babylon, put them in the middle, they're mixed bag. There's some enlightenment and nobility to Babylon, but there's also a real short fuse with Babylon and some ugly stuff there as well. And then put Persia on the far end of the good stuff. The Old Testament actually holds out Persia as being an instrument of God for good. Now Persia, as we go back and dig deeply into who they are and what they did, I mean, they got problems as well. It's not so neat and tidy ethically, but they are miles apart from Assyria in terms of their quality and their artistry and their morality and their dedication to law and how they treat defeated people, Persia's just the best. Now you're probably wondering like, well, where does Egypt go? Put Egypt somewhere else. Egypt is so ancient and weather's the storm for so long. We see so many different incarnations of what Egypt is over really the millennia that Egypt should be thought of more as, well, it depends on when you're asking in terms of what you're gonna get from them. But Assyria is awful and the hubris of the Northern Kingdom of Israel finally comes home to roost. God judges them by the power of Assyria and they get taken away into captivity. Sort of never to be heard from again. This is a massive problem for the person who is reading straight through the Old Testament and who's really latched on to the warning, I guess if you will, that God gave the serpent all the way back in the beginning of Genesis where it looks like the serpent just won and ruined everything. And now redemption's gonna be impossible, but God in lecturing that serpent is like, now there's gonna be one who comes and crushes your head. You're gonna strike it as heel, but he's gonna crush you. So if you're the kind of reader who's like, I like that part where the evil loses and there's some kind of redemption and this story that seems very chaotic and bad ends up somewhere good. I want that. And if you're the kind of person who latched onto the promises that God was making to Abraham in the middle of Genesis and the promise that God made to David about this eternal king and this eternal kingdom and this great king who's gonna reign forever, that's the good stuff. That's the through line of redemption. That's the business you're excited about. Well, pretty much all of the family of Abraham, just in like half a page, gets defeated and taken away into total historical obscurity, there is not much left through which this redemption can even come. The whole thing, the whole narrative, the whole hope for humanity and everything is hanging by a thread after chapter 17. And so then as you keep going through second kings, you're gonna be like, all right, well now all of our hopes are on that southern kingdom. That's all that's left. Come on, come through baby, but they don't. It becomes quickly apparent despite a couple of revivals led by mostly sensible kings like Hezekiah and Josiah. Who rediscovers the law. It's almost like too little, too late when he finds it. And King Nebuchadnezzar from Babylon, Babylon, the great shows up in, I think we still say 586 BC. There's a little bit of debate about that precise year. And he conquers Jerusalem. He leaves the temple destroyed. The dwelling place of God is destroyed. And we wrap up this book with Nebuchadnezzar hauling away what's left of Abraham's descendants, the people through whom the promises held, they get taken away to the east to Babylon. Where does the presence of God dwell now? What happens to the covenant that God made with Moses? Is it over? What about that great nation that was supposed to occur? What about this eternal king and eternal kingdom and all of the redemption that was supposed to happen there? It really genuinely does read at the end of second kings like all hope is lost, except for this one strange little bonus bit right at the end. Have you ever seen one of those things floating around the internet where they're like, who would be King of America today if we went off of George Washington's descendants? Yeah, I don't remember what the guy's name is, but they're like, this would be the guy who would be King of America. Oh, okay, well, whatever, sounds good. Well, apparently they kept track of that kind of stuff in captivity in Babylon as well. And there was this guy named Jehoiachine who was not king, but I guess he would have been king. And for whatever unusual reason, God, it looks like, prompts the king of Babylon to show him some kind of favor. And it's not like the king of Babylon is like, all right, you can go home and you can have a whole kingdom again and everything. No, no, no, no, nothing like that. Just let's him eat at the table with the king of Babylon. And that's it. So why is that there? I don't think it's that tricky actually. It's a glimmer of hope that God is still intending to keep his promise to David that the whole redemptive plan is still on. And it's a bit of foreshadowing for what's gonna happen not under the rule of the Babylonians, but what's gonna happen under the rule of the next great empire, that being the Persians who are gonna conquer Babylon. And as we'll see as we work through the narrative of the Old Testament more, they are gonna be the ones politically who show great favor to God's chosen people. The little glimmer that we get with Jehoiachine is going to be realized much more in the coming historical books. If you're a fan of the redemptive plan, first and second kings look really, really bad, but we don't see anything that says that the plan is off. It looks like this is still a go. Now the deck is just totally stacked against God and we're left to wonder, how is he gonna pull this off? Well, there's one way to find out and that is forward. First Chronicles next time around.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about first chronicles. Hey, my friends, it's Matt, just like Camilla was saying a second ago, we're going to talk about first chronicles today, but I got to tell you, this is the hardest one I've done so far, and it's hard for a couple of reasons. Because this book was difficult for me to read. I was humming, reading all the other books before I would record these episodes, but it has not been a burden. It's just been fun so far. Some catching all kinds of things I hadn't caught before, and I know I'm saying it at like the end of every single episode, but I am learning so much, and I'm just having a blast with this until first chronicles. First of all, it opens with nine straight chapters of genealogy. And look, I've read the Bible and I've thought about this stuff a little bit, and I understand the genealogies are there for a reason, and I even feel comfortable talking about why they're there, but that doesn't change the fact that it is hard to sit down and just read through those names, most of which I can't pronounce. And I should probably know a lot more of them, but I don't because I forget things. And so it's just a lot of unfamiliar material there. But then once I got to the end of that, I'm like, okay, there we go. Good. All right. Now let's move forward, but you don't move forward in first and second chronicles. What you get is a gigantic recap of stuff that you already looked at. And so it's the first time in the Bible, other than the little aside that is Ruth, but even Ruth still feels like you're moving ahead chronologically. It's the first time as you're doing a trip straight through the Bible, where stuff is not happening in order anymore. And just straight up, that can be kind of discouraging. And so I guess what I'm trying to say is on the one hand, if you ever tried to read through the Bible and first and second chronicles were difficult, hey, I feel you. It was difficult for me and recording this follow up summary episode has been abnormally difficult for me as well, because I'm at a rhythm. We're not going through a narrative anymore. It's hard. I don't know what to do. This is like my fifth try at it. Thankfully, you'll never have to hear the wreckage of all of the other tries. But even though I acknowledge and totally empathize with you, if you have found first and second chronicles to be difficult, if you're reading along, I also want to try to sell you on why I think they're awesome. And there's something really brilliant going on here that I don't think I've ever appreciated until this trip through. Let me liken it to this. Have you ever watched a streaming TV show where you queue up the first episode of a new season, and it gives you a recap of a bunch of stuff from all of the previous seasons? Usually, I find those to be helpful, but I'm in a hurry to get it over with. Yeah, I don't want to go watch all 36 one-hour episodes of the show to get back up to speed. So I'm grateful for the plot beats and the characters and like, okay, yeah, that happened. That happened. That's right. And what were the big questions that we're still hanging out there? What are the points of tension? Okay, there you go. Thank you, recap. We're done here. Let's move on. But I've seen a couple of those recaps that were really good. I mean, that recap, it's just a tiny little percentage of all the material that's out there to be drawn from. But on the really good ones, the editing is so masterful that it not only reminds me of plot beats and all of that, but it helps me see a theme that is there, but was really hard to catch when I was going through it all in real time because there's just so much material. And then the recap, boom. It opened my eyes to it. And all of a sudden I'm like, oh, this is even better than I thought it was. That is the experience I'm having right now with first and second chronicles. It is pointing something out to me, the reader who thinks he pretty much got everything there was to get from all of that. Yeah, I get to just first second Kings, first and second Samuel. I think I'm tracking with you. It's pointing out to me that there's stuff that I missed. And it's also pointing out to the original audience. Hey, you think you know this story and where it's at, but there's actually something even better going on here. Okay, there's my little teaser for why first and second chronicles are awesome. Let's get into a few of the details here. First and second chronicles, like first and second Kings and first and second Samuel before it was originally one document, maybe written by Ezra. We don't know for sure who put pen to paper on this other than we can tell from internal evidence that it was probably somebody involved in the priestly side of things. And we can deduce pretty easily that it was written sometime after 539 BC because it mentions Cyrus the Great, the first emperor of Persia by name. Probably it was written somewhere in the 400s BC. Maybe we'll talk more about that tomorrow. Maybe we won't. But as we've discussed before, chronicles, Kings and Samuel had to be cut into two books because of changes in recording, writing, technology. But there's nothing nefarious about those divisions at all in the same way that there's nothing nefarious about how you manage your data differently. Now that you've got multi terabyte micro SD cards versus the one gigabyte and change floppy disks you used to use back in the days, media technology changes things. Nothing weird going on there. But if you have to add a division because of scroll length after the fact, it's nice to put those divisions in good places, Samuel achieves that by ending first Samuel on the cliffhanger with Saul's death. How are things going to work out with David? Find out in second Samuel. Kings does the same thing. We've had this grand drama that's dominated the last chunk of this book between the prophet Elijah and the wicked king of the north, a habit. Now that's kind of resolved. What's going to happen in second Kings with the prophet Elijah's successor and these other awful kings of the north and mediocre kings of the south. Well, first and second Chronicles divides very neatly as well because the whole unified book really only has three parts. Part one is this nine chapter genealogy that I referenced a little bit ago. It is a bit of a slog, but as we look closer, we discover that it's pretty rad and it actually introduces a big theological thesis statement. So that's part one. In chapter 10 through the end of first Chronicles is part two and that is very flattering, very positive look at the reign of King David. And then that comes to an end. And then almost all of second Chronicles is a summary of the deeds of the good kings of the southern kingdom of Judah and then a little tiny detail at the end that involves Cyrus and Persia that we'll get to tomorrow when we look a little more closely at second Chronicles. The first four English letters of first Chronicles are A-D-A-M. It starts that crisply with a genealogy. And as you go through it, you're going to catch some of these names and whether you've looked closely at the Bible or just starting to familiarize yourself with it, there'll be a few of these that are going to pop and you'll be like, Oh, I know the story that goes along with that guy. That makes me think of this and this and it's meant to make you think of those people and what they did. It's also meant to make you think of how God is and what He did in that particular situation. I mean, the big take home of this grand genealogy is look how up and down people are, but look at how faithful God is through the whole thing. We've seen some pretty low times here, original audience to Chronicles, but God has held up His end of the bargain the entire time. He's been faithful even when we've been faithless and He's blessed us in great abundance when we've done what He told us to do per the terms of the deal, the covenant that is that He made with Moses. So I think there are really three through lines of genealogy here in these first nine chapters. One is just the big grand picture is Adam and then on down to Abraham and then Abraham's famous descendants and then on down to David and then forward from David's descendants. It's just the big grand list of the chosen people, family, and it's a reminder that there is a redemptive plan and that all the nations are going to be blessed through this nation through these descendants of Abraham per the terms of the covenant with Abraham back in Genesis chapter 12. But then in chapter two, we get a more specific genealogy where we pinch zoom in on David. And I think this is the second through line genealogy because David of course is a regal genealogy. And so we look backwards from David and we look forwards from David and here we get one name. I don't think that gets mentioned in Kings or Samuel and that is a guy named is a rubable who we're going to hear more about as we go forward into Ezra and Nehemiah here in a couple of days. But this is a big deal because he's the guy who should be king if there was no Babylon and there was no Persia and there was no exile and the kingdom of Judah hadn't fallen. This would be the guy and he returns from exile. So this return to the king is a really big deal because the fact that that name pops right there to you and me, it just looks like a bunch of bees and Z's and it's very confusing like maybe it's a punchline of a joke. But to the original audience, they would be like, that's that's the guy. That's the guy who is carrying forward the promise in his blood. He really, really matters and he was there. Now we have more than a hint of hope. We got some legitimate hope cooking more on that in a minute. Then you've got this third genealogy that looks back toward Aaron, the brother of Moses and forward all the way through the priests at the time that this book was written. This is a priestly genealogy. And so what you got is these three genealogies, I think weaving together all of these very disparate stories to create once it's all assembled this beautiful tapestry that tells the story of God's redemptive plan and the various elements that are going to make it up. Those being God's chosen people, this royal lineage and the priesthood that at this time is serving as the go between God and man. So somebody back in the day is reading those nine chapters of genealogy much more attentively than I'm capable of. They would probably pretty quickly be like, oh, the author of Chronicles is saying there's hope and these are the three threads historically through which we can see God working that hope out from chapter 10 through the end of first Chronicles. Then you get this story of David and as you read through it, you'll notice really quickly that pretty much everything bad about David is omitted. Now I don't think the author of Chronicles here is like, oh, I hope they forget all that stuff and there's the Bathsheba and the murder thing and oh man, we just need to purge that from history. No, I mean, within Chronicles there are references to all these other documents that we no longer have about summaries of the lives of kings. And obviously Samuel would have been in circulation at this point as well. The author of Chronicles knows everybody knows the story of David. They can go and look that stuff up. He's not fooling anybody by trying to reframe David as a better guy than he was. No, what he's doing here is a theological history that's meant to paint a picture of an ideal king. So the theological centerpiece of first Chronicles as it just happens to divide up is in chapter 17 where we get a recap of the covenant that God made with David, the one where David's like, hey God, this is awesome. I'm going to build you a temple and God's like, nope, I'm going to have one of your descendants do that, but I'm going to build for you a royal house. And then he effectively explains that there's going to be this great king and this great king is going to reign forever. And when we look at a bunch of other details about the Messiah from around the Old Testament, it comes very clear the promises the Messiah is going to come from you. So then what we get are a whole bunch of little vignettes of an ideal king, little hints of what it would look like if all the best elements of David's kingship were retained and all of the stupid stuff was not retained. But what we can safely say by the time we get to the end of first Chronicles and compare it with first and second Samuel, which is overwhelmingly what first Chronicles is a summary of is that Samuel is putting pretty heavy emphasis on the stuff that went wrong, both with Saul who barely even gets any mention in first Chronicles and even within David's own reign, which gets quite a lot of screen time, especially in second Samuel. What we're getting back there is a close look at what happens when God's chosen people don't obey his commands per the terms of the deal that God made with Moses. Well, God will punish them. God will correct them. That's what he said he was going to do. What we're getting from Samuel and then on into kings is a description of how we got into this mess in the first place. Here's what went wrong, but what we're starting to see take shape in first Chronicles and this will be carried through into second Chronicles is that the chronicler is telling us, here's what we need to emulate if we want to get it right. Now that God is giving us another crack at this, now that we're in rebuilding mode, now that we can look forward to the dynasty of David being reestablished. Here's the beautiful stuff that needs to be carried forward. Here's what we can do and lean into to make sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past. So there is an inherent optimism here. Everything is being reframed and recast in light of the faithfulness of God to work through these broken people and to twist their stories together into this beautiful mosaic. What we are seeing unfold before us is a masterful recap of everything that we just watched in painstaking detail that shows us that it's not so much a glimmer of hope as much as it is gigantically well placed optimism to believe that this redemptive plan is still on and that God is still going to deliver. So let the reader look forward with optimism and hope and anticipation of what God is still going to do. And if you only have time to read one part of first Chronicles, make it first Chronicles 17 where you get a review of God's covenant with David. And there it is, achievement unlocked. First Chronicles, congratulations. You just leveled up again. This was a hard earned level up for me, but I really enjoyed it and I'm excited for a much easier conversation about second Chronicles, manana. And Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about second chronicles. Hey, my friends, it's Matt, and today I think we've got a pretty easy one, the second chronicles, but it's only going to make sense if you listen to the one on first chronicles from yesterday, because these are one book and they absolutely fit together, lock and key. First chronicles takes us all the way up from the very beginning of stuff that happens in the Old Testament, all the way up to the end of David's reign, and it reframes a pretty ugly story in a very positive, hopeful light indicating that somehow through this twisted up, weird family that has been picked, that has been created out of Abraham, and somehow through this at times compromised and difficult line of kings that has come out of David, and somehow through this line of priests that have come from Aaron and Levi that somehow in all of this, God by His faithfulness is still taking these elements and weaving them together to make this beautiful tapestry that is a picture of redemption. And so chronicles is really giving the reader permission to look back on all of this very complex, multi-season history that you and I have been looking at over the last several episodes, and to see God's faithfulness and hope. Now, look, you and I just went through all of these books and understandably we're like, man, there's a lot of dark stuff in there though, like the hope theme, sometimes it doesn't feel pronounced just in terms of weight. It's like a 20 to 1 ratio ik to good stuff, it seems like at times, but that's part of the beauty of first and second chronicles is that the chronicler is giving himself full permission to say, Hey, original audience, you know, all of the blunders and all of the missteps and all of the really ugly stuff, but let's just focus on what went right with King David. That's first chronicles. And with what went right with all of his successors who did get it right. And that's what we've divided up after the fact into calling second chronicles. Now, what you're going to notice about second chronicles is that it's overwhelmingly just a summary of first and second Kings, but without any reference to the Northern Kingdom. Why is that? Well, I guess it could be out of some sort of deeply harbored bitterness about how badly screwed up the Northern Kingdom was. But I think more likely it's just that the Northern Kingdom doesn't really have any claim to the redemptive plan at this point. They got hauled away into captivity by the Assyrians and the 700s and more or less vanish from history, certainly at least in the mind of the chronicler, that is the case. But it's out of the Southern Kingdom and out of the house of David that the chronicler sees the promises of God and sees the hope for this coming Messiah and the hope for getting things right and for getting back on their feet as the people of God and learning from the past mistakes, chief amongst them being idolatry and not making those mistakes anymore, but also learning from what it was like when they got it right and doubling and tripling down on that get it rightedness. So simply put in second chronicles, what we're getting is a summary of the awesome stuff from the awesomest kings of the Southern Kingdom coming out of the line of David. In fact, there are even some kings who have their flaws emphasized more heavily by the author of Kings who really come off looking pretty good. I mean, really good in second chronicles as the stuff they got right is highlighted. The deal that we saw God make with Moses was a conditional one where he said, I'm going to be your God, you're going to be my people. And all the nations are going to know that that's true. Because if you obey me, I'm going to bless you. And if you disobey me, I'm going to punish you either way, they're going to know that I'm the one true God and that you are my people. Again, paraphrase his mind, but I think it's a faithful one. Well, first and second Samuel and especially first and second kings, show us what happens when you try out the negative side of that bargain. Oh, God did exactly what he said he was going to do. He punished them for all the stuff that they got wrong. Again, chief thing they got wrong, they didn't worship God. They worshiped idols and to the credit of the chronicler and the Jews who came back from exile and all of the Jews who worship God since, they learned they did not repeat this chief mistake that is recorded in judges and Samuel and kings of worshiping false gods. You don't hear anything after this about the Jewish people building up the high places and sacrificing to Molech or Daegon or Ashera or Baal. Those days are over. We don't see more golden calves after this moment. It seems like the lesson really hit home. And I got to think that this big theological recap like we talked about yesterday that we're getting here in first and second Chronicles really helped with that. It helped people to watch this whole thing and to see all of this story distilled down into just this one book and be like, wow, we really did blow it, didn't we? We really need to rededicate ourselves to these temple practices, to the proper worship of God, the sacrificial system. We need to rededicate ourselves to the worship of God and God alone and to engaging in these civil practices properly. And if anything, they took it to heart so very deeply and so very well, you can almost see the seeds of the overreaction that the Pharisees and the religious leaders got wrong in the time of Jesus a little later on when we get into Matthew and we got time before we get to that. So again, though, simply put first and second Samuel, first and second Kings even judges. Here's what happens when you get it wrong. God will hold up his end of the deal and he will punish his chosen people. But then first and second Chronicles, here's what it looks like when you get it right. On the other side of that deal, God will be faithful there as well and he will honor his promises and he will bless his people. I mean, everybody who's reading first and second Kings knows how it ends. The temple gets destroyed. Nebuchadnezzar brings ruin on Jerusalem and everything is wrecked and we're all hauled off into captivity and there's just nothing left. It's horrible. Well, it's a retrospective on what went wrong. It's a post-mortem. It's a Monday morning quarterbacking of a horrible, awful, ugly, inevitable train wreck, slow motion loss. Well, if that's what it is, then this, like I was saying yesterday is why first and second Chronicles are so awesome. It's a slow motion. Monday morning quarterback looking forward to next week's game. Let's learn from our mistakes, but mostly let's focus on what we got right so that we can have a sense of why this is going to work this time when it didn't last time because we're going to lean into these things that went right and we're going to honor these things that God wants us to honor. And we're going to follow the example of this idealized composite of a great king for the short term that we get from David and the best exploits of David, I should say, and the best stuff from all these other kings. And all of that together will give us sort of a vision of virtue and what we could be. It's also going to look really good to the Persians who would probably have access to this book and we'd just like to know that you're going to do virtue and that you're going to be easy to manage when you live in this new land because all of this was happening with the permission of Persia. But bigger picture, the composite that we get from all of these little nuggets of the best moments of all of these kings, when you put it together, you start to get a hint of what the great king could look like in terms of virtue, in terms of attributes. You get the this tiny little percentage, this little first fruits of what could be the real harvest of what that king could be and what could come with that great king when that one who was promised to come in 1 Chronicles 17 and in 1 Samuel 7 when that great king finally arrives. So this summary of the good stuff of all the kings and 2 Chronicles and the good stuff about David and 1 Chronicles, it also rounds out a question that's introduced in Judges. Remember there, it's, well, everybody's, they had no king and they just did what was right in their own eyes and it's the closing line of Judges and you're like, oh, well, I guess the only glimmer of hope there is maybe if there was a really good king, it would counteract these truly wicked impulses because humans, they got the disease, the virus of sin, they just, they cannot fix their own evil, maybe a king somehow could stymie that or address that problem, but it doesn't come into focus at all until 1st and 2 Chronicles when the chronicler is like, now imagine a kingdom, now imagine a king who had all the best elements of all the best moments of all of the best kings and you can start to see what maybe this thing might look like and how there could be a real remedy to the evil of the human heart, the brokenness of the human situation in not just any king, not just in the office of king, but in a very specific king who is starting to come into focus as we finish up this big overview theological recap that we get in 1st and 2 Chronicles. When you picture 2 Chronicles, picture a great big giant, very positive theological recap of a wonderful premium TV show that covers a gigantic swath of time with a whole bunch of really good, really likable, really noble kings who get a bunch of stuff right. If you don't have time to read all of 2 Chronicles, check out 2 Chronicles 6, which is Solomon's beautiful blessing of the people at the dedication of the temple in his prayer of dedication and make sure to read the first few verses of chapter 7 where God shows up in that temple. Those are powerful moments. Okay, my friends, high five. You have just leveled up once again, achievement unlocked, 2 Chronicles right on. This really is an achievement and it's awesome that you're doing it. This has been so good for me. I hope it has been for you as well. I'm excited to move into a whole new era with Ezra next time around. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Ezra. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. Thanks for hanging out with me and talking about the Book of Ezra today, which is a sneaky, relatable book. It shouldn't be relatable. On paper, this book should be so foreign. It's a political thriller that looks like it's just a bunch of bureaucratic tension where the main narrative thrust of the story is, will the heroes find the proper requisition forms and fill them out before end of workday on Friday and get it in front of the right bureaucrat middle management type who will be sympathetic when he finds that form and approve it or will they not? Sounds boring, right? Sounds not relatable unless you're in that world and that line of work, but it is relatable because it's actually the story of a bunch of people realizing they had something beautiful and they wrecked it and then they get sad about the fact that they wrecked it and then they're faced with a choice that we're all faced with when we wreck something beautiful and realize it. And that is, do I one, keep my pride, blame other people and just wallow in self-pity and dream about what might have been forever? Or do I two do the difficult thing, admit that I screwed this thing up and that I had a hand in destroying something beautiful and then go about the difficult work of rebuilding something where I did damage? Well, in Ezra and Nehemiah, what you get is a bunch of very brave people saying, now we're going to admit our culpability in this and we're going to go do the very difficult work of rebuilding something beautiful. And then all the bureaucracy and the politics and all of that, that intrigue takes on a lot more meaning and it's a lot more fun. So here's what happened historically that sets up the book of Ezra because it can be a little disorienting when you turn the page from Second Kings or Second Chronicles, they both covered the same material and all of a sudden the world has changed as you turn over to Ezra chapter one. Well, here's how the world changed. In 722, the brutal cruel iron fisted Assyrians from up north finally had had enough of the shenanigans of the failed northern kingdom of Israel, which was representative of 10 tribes who descended from Jacob and Assyria comes in as like enough and they just crush the north. They take everyone away into captivity. The Assyrians do all kinds of forced resettlement and intermarriage program with the people they defeat in the south where the tribes of Judah and Benjamin are in the kingdom of Judah, the one that David's line continues through. We see them last about 140 ish years longer, but ultimately the same kind of mistakes that plagued the north bite the south and the butt and they get conquered by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. The Babylonians are the new big dogs by 586 BC when they conquered the southern kingdom. They've already done away with the Assyrians and the Babylonians are pretty iron fisted, but not as iron fisted as the Assyrians after they destroy the temple and destroy the sacrificial system and wreck all of Judah. They just leave a few people behind to be vine dressers and plowmen as the text puts it and everybody else they take away into captivity back to Babylon modern day Iraq modern day Baghdad, but this doesn't last very long because in 539 BC, so again, we're only talking about 45 ish years later, along come the Persians under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. Cyrus doesn't just conquer the regional power that is Babylon. Cyrus conquers everything the entire map of everything we've seen in the Bible up to this point. So we're not talking about a really powerful king or a little regional king. We're talking about something new when we talk about the king of Persia. We're talking about the decider. We're talking about a grand administrative state connected by a network of essentially pony express writers who could swap messages across everything in just a matter of days. This is an unprecedented bureaucratic state with one person at the head who is the bottleneck for all the decision making of the world as we know it. Here's the deal though. Persia learned some stuff from their predecessors who they displaced. The iron fistedness of Assyria and Babylon. It was brittle. It was frail. It didn't work. They couldn't keep everybody in line. So rather than making everyone horribly and exclusively fear the king, the Persians are like, what if we make them like us? What if we give them some adult responsibility and treat them like they know how to handle their own business and honor and respect their gods and their beliefs. And so Cyrus demonstrates that that is to be his administrative modus operandi in Ezra chapter one in the very first year of his reign by saying, all right, we got these people that are called the Jews and they're here in exile. Yeah, they should be allowed to go home and their religion is such that they need to worship in this temple. Well, then they should be allowed to rebuild that temple and they should be allowed to resume worship. And so what we've got at the beginning of Ezra chapter one is just a confluence of a bunch of really big history things. The northern kingdom deported and gone. The southern kingdom of Judah in exile in Babylon, but along comes this liberator from the east, a man who was prophesied in advance by name by Isaiah the prophet. This guy shows up and he does exactly what he's supposed to do. He takes a situation that seemed like it would never change. This exile is going to be forever and he flips it on its head and all of a sudden there's another chance. The tiny glimmer of hope that is all we were left with at the end of second Kings and at the end of second Chronicles has suddenly blossomed into something that gives us real reason for hope. So immediately at the beginning of Ezra, the exiles rally behind a guy named is a rubable who is a direct descendant of David. And if there was still a kingdom in Judah, he would be sitting on the throne in Jerusalem at this point. Now, he's not going to be a king, but he is going to be the one to lead the exiles back and rebuild the temple. And that's what he does in chapter three. He rebuilds the altar and they start sacrificing on that again. And then he starts clearing the temple rubble away and he rebuilds the beginnings of the foundation of the temple. And there's an event in chapter three that I think is so important to our understanding thematically of the whole Old Testament. At this event is a rubable and some of the priestly types get everybody together and they're like, look, we got a foundation going here. Look at the size of it and all of the Gen X types, generation, exile, they're young. They've never seen the temple. They've never seen anything like this before. And they're like, this is awesome. And they're cheering and celebrating and dancing and everything. But all of the old people who were little kids when the temple of Solomon got destroyed and they can still remember what it looked like. They're all crying loudly because they're like, Oh man, like this is great and all, but we will never recapture the splendor of this beautiful thing. We used to have and that we wrecked. And the author of Ezra says you couldn't tell the difference between the celebration and the morning and the sound of it all could be heard from a very long ways away. What an interesting metaphor for what we've seen play out in the whole Old Testament with this family that God made from Abraham. It's this mix of lament and beautiful stuff and both the good stuff and the ugly stuff can be heard from a long ways away by all the other nations and everybody else. Well, along comes some of the locals who never went into exile who were left there by the Assyrians or the Babylonians. And they're like, well, we worship your God. Can we help you build the temple? Is the rubables like no, scram beat it. And there are two schools of thought as to how this should be read. Number one is to say is a rubable was right. He could detect these people were up to no good. They were scoundrels. They were going to try to sabotage things. And so we ran them off. The second school of thought is this return from exile was imperfect. And what we see here is a rubable and then Ezra and Nehemiah are going to do the same thing later on over correcting mistakes they made in the first place so that now they're making some new mistakes the other way. I honestly am still not sure which one is happening here. So you just have to read that for yourself and see what you make of it. Well, either way, the result is the same. These non exiled locals feel jilted and they start resisting the rubable and this resistance goes on for several Persian kings reigns on down the road. Well, in the midst of this work kind of grinding to a halt in the midst of these bureaucratic complaints and delays, Cyrus the great dies. So he's the champion of this project and now he's out of the picture. His head stuffed in a bag full of wine by the queen of the Massagatai way up north. Well, what's his successor going to do? Well, his kids bungle the transition. Cambyses and another kid named Bardiah and the next great king to come out of all of this is not a descendant of Cyrus at all. It's a man named Darius and Darius doesn't know anything about this decree of Cyrus. So now we got a situation this reminiscent of when the Pharaoh in Egypt showed favor to Joseph and his family, but then some generations passed in the new Pharaoh didn't remember any of that stuff or what they owed Joseph and his family. And now you got a problem. Is it going to happen again or will Darius come around? Well, what we discover is that the Persians are more even handed and through a series of bureaucratic document filings, Darius becomes aware that the work has been stopped and has all held up in red tape and he's advised to go search the records and try to figure out if there was actually some decree to build this temple. So he goes and he looks and he finds it, but it's still binding because it was issued by Cyrus and the word of a king of Persia, the king of kings is binding from generation to generation. So Darius is not only like, yeah, resume the work, but here's a bunch more money and resources. What do you need? And things get rolling again. And then the temple is finished and we have a big dedication ceremony, not really nearly as big as the one we had when Solomon dedicated it, but we're all anticipating that just like when the tabernacle was dedicated and Solomon's temple was dedicated, there's going to be fire from the Lord and the cloud of the presence of God is going to visibly show up and he's going to live amongst his people. And it doesn't happen. He really comes and goes and there's no event. Then we fast forward a little ways to the life of Ezra and he finds favor with another Persian king down the road, Artaxerxes. And Artaxerxes is like, yeah, go back Ezra and finish out this temple project by fully recreating the temple culture and sacrificial system that you used to have there and build your people back up. It's a lot of paraphrasing on my part, but that's what happens. And so as we goes back, see some problems with how things are going with the exiles and whips them into shape again. And here we get something that's kind of reminiscent of Deuteronomy, almost like a reinvigorating of the covenant. Remember you got with generation two of the people wandering in the wilderness before they went into the promised land. Moses laid out the law and renewed the covenant kind of feels like that's what we're doing again here. Now that Ezra, this scribe of a priestly origin shows up in Jerusalem and he gets there and he's like, wow, it's really hard for us to show our dedication to God and to demonstrate that we understand how we wrecked something beautiful when we're making all the same mistakes boomed before. And he particularly is troubled by the intermarriage between the Jewish exiles and some of the local women. And so he gets everybody together and has a big meeting is like, this is sin. You need to call it sin. And you need to put away all of these wives. You need to cast them out and dissolve these marriages. Some people look at Ezra's behavior in the second half of the book of Ezra and they're like, yeah, that's what needed to happen. Like purge everything that was going wrong. And only then could you have any hope of getting things back on track because that intermarriage and that getting too cozy with foreign gods and ideologies, that's what wrecked the kingdom in the past. You can't make that mistake again. And other people would look at it and be like, oh, this might have been an odd, even bitter over correction that demonstrates that now we're into a new phase of God's own people sort of understanding God, but not totally understanding what God wants. Again, I'm not 100% sure on how I read it yet. And I'm going to reserve the right to keep thinking about that. I'll let you read it and make of it what you will. What I do know is this, with the artificial division between Ezra and Nehemiah, we get just a clunky, bummer, weird, let down ending to the book of Ezra. Are you ready for the last verse of Ezra? Get ready. This is a story about fixing something beautiful that you broke and moving forward with courage and admission of fault. This is the last sentence in this inspiring book, ready. All these had married foreign women and some of the women had even born children. The end. It feels very hollow coming on the heels of everything we've read. But in fairness, let's try to reserve judgment here until we've read the second half of the book, remembering that Ezra, Nehemiah is one book assembled by the same person. So let's see how this thing rounds out now that Nehemiah comes into focus as the main character next time around. When you think of Ezra, think of rebuilding a newer, smaller temple at the behest of a great Persian king and think of the zealous purging of certain cultural and marital practices that were going on with the exiles at that time. If you don't have time to read the whole book, make sure to catch the second half of chapter three, which is the dedication, if you will, of the foundation and that mixed response to it. And make sure to catch the second half of chapter six, which is the less than eventful dedication of the completed temple. And with that, let us congratulate each other on unlocking the Ezra achievement. We have leveled up. There's so, so, so, so, so much more here and it kills me not to get all the way into the rest of it, but hopefully we can pick up some of it in Nehemiah next time around. All right, I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Nehemiah. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. Thanks for hanging out with me and talking about the book of Nehemiah today. And Nehemiah, as we talked about yesterday when we were looking at Ezra, is an interesting animal because it isn't a book unto itself in its original form. It's the second half of one unified book that is now split into Ezra and Nehemiah. And at the simplest level, it's the story of how Nehemiah, the cup bearer to the great king of kings, the king of Persia, receives permission to go back as an exile to Jerusalem and to oversee the rebuilding of the walls of the city of Jerusalem. Does it sound like that big a deal or that big a project to you and me? Because why do you need walls around a city? What's that going to do? Why does it matter? But you got to not think modernly here. You got to think about the ancient world. A city without walls wasn't a city. A city without walls couldn't protect, say, a sacred temple inside those city limits. The walls are what kept it from being toppled by even just a few men or a band of brigands who were looking for an easy city to sack. No walls in the ancient world meant your city was not legit. And so all the work that's recorded in Ezra involving the building and dedication of the temple and the reestablishment of the covenant people of Israel, all of that's going to be a moot point really quickly here. It's inevitably going to get wrecked again at the hands of somebody who doesn't appreciate all that went into it and all that it represents if you don't get some walls up around it. So the book of Nehemiah opens with Nehemiah being made aware of the broken down state of the walls and the fact that the gates, which would have been made a heavy timbers are all burned. And he's deeply saddened by this. So we get a little bit more sense of how big a deal walls were because if Nehemiah is a socially competent enough man to ascend all the way to the level of trusted behind the scenes servant of the king of kings, the king of the world, he's a socially competent enough man not to just fall apart and ball because oh my walls got hit on my door burned. It couldn't just mean what it means to you and me. It must have meant something much bigger. And I think indeed what it meant is what we were talking about just a minute ago. The project isn't done. The city has people in it and as a temple, but it's not a real city. And Nehemiah knows that the first time the Persians aren't able to keep an eye on it. It's going to get toppled, conquered and sent back to ruin. And Nehemiah at this point would have been familiar with everything that went into getting Jerusalem back even to the modest state that it is in now that building meant more to them than you and I think of buildings meaning to us today. So the book opens with Nehemiah hanging out with a new king of Persia who we have met. His name has cropped up in the book of Ezra. His name is Artaxerxes. And we know from history that he was a man who was very sensitive to the needs of his people. What a wonderful reputation to have handed down through time about you to be a man who had so much power and admittedly at times wielded it with ferocious force. But generally speaking, to be a man who had so much power and a rule with a posture and attitude and bent toward peace and empathy. That's a very remarkable thing. The Bible treats Artaxerxes very well and history treats him very well. So that squares up pretty neatly for me. And we actually get a pretty tender look at Artaxerxes in a vulnerable human situation when Nehemiah shows up and his face tells the story of Nehemiah being sad and Artaxerxes is like, what's going on, man? You're not sick and yet your face is downcast. You're not like that. What's happening? And Nehemiah is like, how can I smile when I know that the walls of my home city where the graves of my fathers are is torn down and that the gates are burned and Artaxerxes in this scene, like clearly he knows what that means in the ancient world. You can't have walls like that and you can't have gates burned like that. The graves of my good friend Nehemiah's fathers, they're going to end up getting desecrated and that city's going to get wrecked. And so it's just beautiful. The way Artaxerxes, he doesn't negotiate or anything is answered in Nehemiah telling them what's going on and just say, how long would it take you to get there? How long do you think you would need to stay? Wow. Have you ever had somebody in a position of authority? Give you the green light on something so graciously and so quickly. I've only got a few minutes to cover this, but this scene touches me so much that I'm taking a disproportionately large amount of time on it. Let's move forward. Nehemiah goes back to Jerusalem, discovers that the walls are indeed, as he's heard reported, in very bad repair. And he figures out which people are going to be loyal and do something about it. And then we get this cool story of him whipping people into shape and different groups, almost like that adopt a highway thing that we have in my country. And it's like this mile of highway was adopted by the daughters of American liberty of Springfield, Nebraska. And they like go out there and they clean it up. Well, we kind of get the same kind of stuff in Nehemiah. It's like this particular gate was adopted by the sons of these people. And the dungate was fixed up by the people of this town and just sounds like everybody really rallied together and got something going and not much had been happening here for a long time, which means that this is maybe a good place to step back for a moment and talk timeline just so that we're oriented here because we're talking about events that cover a century when we deal with Ezra and Nehemiah. So again, Cyrus the Persian conquered the Babylonians in 539 BC in the first year of his reign. So what would that be? Five thirty eight, maybe still five thirty nine. He gives permission for the exiles to go home. That's what we get in the book of Ezra. The exiles go under the leadership of Zerubah and they get a lot of stuff done in the early going to get the altar up and running. They get the temple going, but then just three years after Cyrus's conquest of Babylon, that work grinds to a halt. The whole empire goes through some crazy stuff in five thirty when Cyrus the great dies. But Darius eventually realizes that Cyrus had given permission and he re-initiates the building of the temple around five twenty. The temple is then completed in five sixteen and then we fast forward past the rest of the reign of Darius, the famous reign of Xerxes who fought against the Greeks and King Leonidas. And we get a good ways into the reign of Xerxes son, Artaxerxes, who is the guy who allows Ezra to go and nurture the people and teach them the law of God. Twelve or thirteen years later, still under the reign of Artaxerxes, Nehemiah, the king's cup bearer, goes and joins Ezra. They overlap for a little while in Jerusalem and Nehemiah begins work on these walls in four forty five. So Cyrus the great, conquerors Babylon five thirty nine. Now we're all the way up to four forty five. It's a big chunk of time that we've covered here. Well at this point in the story, Nehemiah is going to encounter the same thing that Zarubah will encounter and that Ezra encountered and that is opposition to the thing they were commissioned by the king of kings, the king of Persia to go and do. In Nehemiah's case, the opposition comes from a whole bunch of neighboring people who are like, Oh, dang, we do not want to see Jerusalem get up to her knees and stand to her feet. That is a powerful city with a powerful history and it is not good for us if they get those walls built. And so the enemies of the Jewish people in Jerusalem, their neighbors, they want to keep Jerusalem down. And apparently they don't feel like they have as much recourse in terms of exploiting the bureaucratic state to accomplish that. So they just go with violence and Nehemiah ends up having to use half of his wall builders just to defend the wall builders with swords and spears and bows during the building process. Everybody's wearing a sword on their hip the whole time. It sounds like there was trouble constantly, but the walls get built in four forty five. As the walls are getting completed, Ezra stands outside one of the gates and does this reading and interpreting of the law for everyone. So it's like another covenant renewal saying we got to get this stuff right. All of these walls and all of this temple, it's all for nothing. If we don't understand the law and we don't understand where we fit into this story, Nehemiah eight eight specifically addresses how that reading of the law went. It says they read from the book from the law of God clearly and they gave the sense so that the people understood the reading. Look, look, I got my biases. Obviously, I'm kind of a fan of the idea of looking at the Bible and reading it and then carefully trying to get the sense of it together in a group setting. You know, I'm into that sort of thing. So I really resonate with this particular verse, but there's power in it. The people understood. It's like when King Josiah rediscovered the book of the law and it made sense to him and it clicked and it broke his heart and it changed him. Well, the same thing happens here toward the end of Nehemiah. The people hear it and they're like, ah, we destroyed something beautiful as a people. And now we're going through the hard work of putting it back together, but we're still making some of the mistakes that destroyed it in the first place. And so along with the reading and the law and the official dedication of the completed wall and services for the first time being held in the temple that is now protected and enclosed fully by the wall, you get yet another thing that kind of feels like a renewal of the covenant back in Deuteronomy and you get another uncomfortable, but some would say necessary. Others would say over corrective purging of intermarriages between the pagan outsiders and the Jewish exiles. And what we see coming out of this is the beginnings of the temple culture and the very law oriented, legalistic, religious culture of Jesus time characterized by the Pharisees and the take home from all of it is yeah, they're doing the right thing to try and go rebuild something beautiful. Yes, God seems to be directing the heart of the great kings of Persia to support this effort, but also there's no evidence that God showed up to live in that temple again the way he did before. And that does kind of linger with you as you move on from these books. Like we talked about, Ezra and Nehemiah is a composite of a whole bunch of bureaucratic documents receipts inventory lists and also memoirs, most noticeably from Ezra and Nehemiah themselves. So at times we get first person recordings of their actions and even of their prayers. And in this case, it sort of ends with a prayer slash diary entry from Nehemiah. This is the closeout of the whole Ezra Nehemiah thing. He says, thus I cleanse to them from everything foreign and I established the duties of the priests and Levites each in his work and I provided for the wood offering at appointed times and for the first fruits. Remember me. Oh my God, for good. And that is where I most resonate with these guys. I have destroyed beautiful things and I've tried to redeem those beautiful things that I've had a hand in destroying, but that's a messy work and it never quite feels like you nailed it. And in the end of one of those kind of ordeals that you've probably gone through as well, there isn't much more that you can do than say, I squared accounts with everybody I could square accounts with. I did my best to get this thing right. Please remember me. Oh my God, for good. When you visualize Nehemiah, visualize the city walls of Jerusalem. When you think about the theme of Nehemiah, think about that last verse of the book that I just read. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, I recommend reading the first and last chapter where you get that tender interaction with the king of kings, Artaxerxes and where you get Nehemiah looking back and reflecting on all that's happened. Look at that achievement unlocked. We've got Nehemiah now. Congratulations on leveling up with me. Okay, we're going to experience quite the tonal shift as we enter the court of the Persian king Xerxes next time around in the beloved book of Esther. All right, I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Esther. I love the Book of Esther. This is one of my favorites in the whole Bible, and I don't say that at the expense of anything else in the Bible. Obviously, I really like the whole thing. I mean, look what we're doing here as an exercise. This one has a little different feel to it because it's just a straight up story, and it is a great story. It has all of the elements of all the great stories that you and I love and that transcend genre and that transcend culture and language and region and time. This is one of the all-time greats. Even if there's no Bible, even if hypothetically that didn't exist, I still think Esther would be a great all-time classic story because of how perfectly structured it is. It's got all the elements. It's got a neat, tidy beginning and middle and end. You can follow the flow of the story. You can feel the tension, ebb and flow at a perfect pace. It's got colorful, vibrant, compromised characters who you can relate to and you can understand their motives, but they've also got a degree of unpredictability and multifacetedness. It's got a strong lead character who just happens to also be a strong female lead character. That makes it stand out from a lot of other ancient literature, but rather than her being some kind of simplistic Mary Sue who just sort of feels like a lecture to the audience for not liking shows that feature women quite enough. Instead, we get a dynamic, complicated, compromised character here who has issues that are external to her but also issues that are internal to her that she has to overcome. That's a character you can relate to. Frankly, people who write stories today could probably use to take a few notes on how to properly write a female character from what we're seeing here in Esther. There's a reason she is beloved through the ages as this book is beloved through the ages. But in addition to that, the story is that she's not a female. She also has a creepy, nasty, snidey, evil villain, but the villain is pretty gifted. But that bad guy is ultimately going to have a fatal flaw that Esther doesn't have. Esther can overcome with the help of other people and maybe discreetly from God. She can overcome the problems she has within. Heyman also has problems within, but he can't overcome them. He gives into them. He can't grow. He can't change. He'll fall victim to his own devices. That's great storytelling. But another reason that Esther works so well is that it has stakes. You care stakes. Ha ha ha ha. That's a good one, Whitman. I'm going to keep that. It was an accident, but it stays. What I mean is it has stakes like there's something in play. The plot doesn't work out the way you want it to work out. Characters you care about and so much more are going to suffer a horrible fate. And so anytime you're looking at a story, if it's a good story, you care about the outcome. There's something in play. Another reason I think this is a beloved story for the ages is the thematic material. Think about it. Every great story you've ever really sunk your teeth into. It has maybe multiple levels of themes and points, maybe even a little bit of a moral, but it's not so on the nose that you just have to be like, Oh, there it was. I can take or leave that proposition. Now, the authors of the great stories give you a little bit of room to stew on it, to ruminate on it, to consider it from different angles. And the great stories might hit you in different ways at different times. You might relate to different characters at different times in your life. And Esther gives us all of that. The book of Esther is set in Persia under the reign of Kings. So, Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm forgetting something really important before we get into the actual summary here. God doesn't come up in this book, which is crazy because it's in the Bible. And the book thematically seems to have a lot to do with the providence of God, but he doesn't get mentioned. It doesn't even really get alluded to in this book more on that in a minute. Okay, back to the summary. This is set in Persia. King Xerxes is the third prominent king of Persia. Well, what we know from this time is really actually quite a bit. There are a lot of sources on the lives of Darius and Xerxes, one in particular, a Greek guy living under Persian rule named Herodotus, who is the father of history. He's the first one who really spun great historical tales with middling accuracy by modern standards, but with excellent delivery by ancient standards. And we know that Darius had a problem with the far west end of his empire getting out into Turkey and toward Greek territory. He couldn't control the Athenians and the Spartans on the Aegean Sea and the Athenians and the Spartans and some other Greek cities. They kept messing with Greekish Persian cities in modern day Turkey. And Darius was like, enough, I'm just going to go out and crush these little fleas. And he went to do it, but it didn't really work. And then he died and kind of like David passed on some grudges to Solomon. So Darius passed on some grudges to Xerxes. And the book of Esther opens with Xerxes planning a gigantic campaign, the biggest the world would ever see to go and teach those dirty Greeks a lesson. Now, if you remember anything from your Western Civ class or from Zack Snyder's 300, you know that this is the campaign where Xerxes ran into Leonidas and the 300 Spartans who are enshrined in legend as holding the pass of Thermopylae to bravely and self-sacrificially by time as the Persian horde was marching on Athens and the Athenians were able to evacuate their city and ready a naval defense under the brave leadership of the Maustic Lees. All of those details or most of those details are gleaned from the storytelling of Herodotus. And regardless of how biased Herodotus might have been one way or another, he gives us enough details that we can triangulate that probably this King Ahasarus or Xerxes as Herodotus called him, it's the Greekification of his Persian name. This guy was probably putting together a war council at the beginning of the book of Esther to prepare for that campaign. So this story by the anonymous author of the book of Esther is set against the backdrop of this super well known gigantic global historical political military event that is about to unfold. And that failure of Xerxes to go and correct the Greeks might be a little ha ha rib rib nod nod about how impotent Xerxes is imagined to be by some of the intended audience of this book. But whatever the case Xerxes comes off as pretty silly early on in the book. He's trying to impress everybody. Everybody gets licked up and Xerxes is like, all right, let me bring out my super attractive wife and maybe we'll have her do a little sexy dance to entertain everybody. But the Queen Vashti is having none of it. It's like, no, I'm not doing that. And Xerxes, who theoretically is the big decision maker around here, gets easily influenced by alcohol and others to depose his queen in a rash move, issue an edict about all the men in person, they need to crack down on their misbehaving wives and could be so influenced by him, which is kind of funny because he's going to be influenced for good by his wife in just a few chapters. And he deposes the queen and then decides to have a contest to pick a replacement queen. Now the winner of this contest probably wouldn't be the only queen. It looks like Xerxes probably had multiple queens and concubines, if you will. But this is still a really high stakes deal. And whoever wins is going to ascend to the throne, the position of queen of the world. And that's when we meet a couple of Jewish exiles named Mordecai, who's older and his younger cousin, Hadassa, or Esther is the name she uses in a Persian context. Mordecai seems to be a man of influence and he becomes aware of this contest. And he's like Esther, you are going to sign up for the contest and you're going to win. And dang it, she does right from the beginning. She's got a way with the court attendance and she wins the favor of all the people who are kind of behind the scenes in this contest, Esther, who is awesome, but also a compromised character. And her family haven't gone back to be a part of the rebuilding of the temple and the reestablishing of sacrifices and the rebuilding of the walls back in Jerusalem. They've chosen to stay in Persia. There's something they like about it. It's kind of working for them there. That's okay. But there would have been varied opinions on that amongst the original audience as to what they should have done. Well, Esther wins and is made queen, which is a crazy reversal because she's an exile whose family was taken there by force. And now she's risen all the way to this crazy high position. That's amazing. Has some overtones like Joseph back in Egypt or Nehemiah who would serve Xerxes son Artaxerxes. What's about this time that we get introduced to someone who is descended from one of the age old enemies of the Jewish people, that being Haman. He's an Aggagite or an Amalekite. That is he's a Canaanite enemy of the Jewish people going all the way back to the reign of King Saul. The grudges don't go away fast in the ancient world. And Haman, who has the favor of the king and is a very high ranking court official, gets really grouchy when Mordecai the Jew reveals that he's a Jew and won't bow down to Haman. That's enough to provoke Haman and to make him want to abuse his royal court power to dispose not just of Mordecai, but of the Jews in general. So in keeping with his Canaanite ways, he appeals to fate and pagan deities by rolling a dice to let them decide what would be the best day to enact this purge. This effectively genocide against the Jews using the power of Xerxes who Haman then bilts into signing a decree without looking at it carefully that would bring about said genocide. Well, now it's just a matter of time. It's a race against the clock as to whether this date is going to come to pass or whether someone can intervene, but who's in a position to intervene? There's nobody in a position of influence to help the situation who cares about the fate of the Jewish people other than Queen Esther. And she's initially very bulky about it, but Mordecai who's already demonstrated that he has an ear to the ground and he's a pretty shrewd guy. He now turns that shrewdness to making sure that his cousin Esther the queen will take action to defend her people. In so many words, he says, if this thing goes down, people are going to find out you were Jewish and you'll perish like the rest of us just in the palace. And then he seems to quickly switch tone to something a little more nurturing and points to the providence of God, famously saying, maybe you were appointed to this spot for a time such as this. Esther has a change of heart and decides that she will indeed act and she musters her courage and she goes before the king who receives her. This is huge. But rather than just going to the king and being like, you wish you a stupid order, unmake it. She and we already know that Xerxes doesn't respond well to this kind of confrontational tone from his wife. So instead she sets up a trap to counteract Haman's trap. She throws a couple of banquets over the course of that providentially in between the two banquets. The king can't sleep one night and he's like, you know what? Read me some stuff about what's going on in the kingdom. And he gets reminded of Mordecai the Jew saving his life. He's like, yeah, we should honor him. Well, next morning, Haman comes in and the king's like, what should be done for somebody in whom the king delights and Haman's like, he's probably talking about me. Well, he should be paraded around through town and dressed up all fancy and told the king delights in him. And Xerxes is like awesome. Mordecai the Jew. If I delight in, go parade him around town. And this is the pivot point of the book where all of the fortunes start to change towards something better. Well, in the second banquet that Haman and the king are invited to Esther reveals that she's a Jew and is like this guy right over here. Haman is trying to sell me and my people out and is using trickery to deceive you. And the king's like, what the heck? And then Haman miscalculates and tries to persuade Esther in a way that maybe involves physical intimidation and the king catches it happening is like, what the heck are you doing with my wife, dude? And it ends up that the stake that was stuck in the ground with a point that Haman had intended to impale Mordecai on ends up getting used on Haman instead. And then Esther with the wisdom of Mordecai is able to figure out a way to get the king to issue a decree that doesn't countermand one of his already existing decrees. Apparently you couldn't do that in Persia if you were a king, but rather a decree that would allow the Jews to defend themselves when all of these sleeper cells got activated on genocide day that had been determined by that role of the dice. And indeed, this decree gets issued by the king and all the Jews take up arms and they defeat the people who are trying to kill them. And it's this glorious day of victory and God's chosen people are sustained and the redemptive plan is going to continue to move forward. And then the book ends the way it begins with a celebration. But this one is better. But of a drunken war council, it's the initiation of a new feast of celebration, the feast of Purim, poor being the name of those dice. What does it all mean when we add it up? Well, the master of fate is a God who doesn't even have to be mentioned to be providentially in control. Even when it seems like he's not there, he's still running the show. Who's the real king of kings? Not the easily influenced Xerxes who thumps his chest and proclaims his titles at every opportunity, not Haman, the schemer and the manipulator who's rotting on a stake somewhere. No, it's God. Even when he isn't mentioned, he is still king. And he's still the one who directs all of these things by his will and power. When you visualize Esther picture Esther bravely going into the throne room, uninvited picture Haman impaled on his own spike and picture the role of the dice, which will remind us of the big theme of Esther, which would seem to be God's providence over everything, even when he's seemingly not there. If for some reason you don't have time to go read the whole book, make sure you at least read chapter four where we get the very human interaction between Mordecai and Esther and where she summons her strength and courage to go and fight for her people. I hope you've had a good time with this one. I have here's a high five. Congratulations for unlocking the Esther achievement. If you find this story to be interesting, please, please, please make plans when we're done with this series to join me for a crazy deep dive into the book of Esther. We'll be looking back into Ezra and Nehemiah and Persian history and all of this. As soon as we're done with the trip through the Bible, we're coming back to this. And this is going to be our long term focus for our next big book of the Bible series. All right. This was a blast. Thank you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Job. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Thanks for hanging out with me here and talking about the book of Job, which is one that when you read it as a kid, maybe your first time through the Bible, you're like, this is boring and different from everything I've read in the Bible so far. It gets a little heady for me. And I think the reason that this book doesn't appeal to the young reader as much is because usually, at least in our cultural context, the young reader hasn't suffered very much yet. But this is a book that takes on more and more meaning as life goes on for people. And as they come back around to it and realize, oh, dang, Job is wrestling with some of the questions that I wrestle with as I get further along in life. And indeed, that's what I've discovered is I've picked Job back up for the first time in a long time in anticipation of the conversation that you and I are having right now. But not some bolts wise, Job, right off the bat, it's going to read way different than everything we've seen so far. The only thing that's even kind of familiar that we've read so far compared to Job is the stuff like right at the very, very beginning with the creation account and a conversation happening in the presence of God because like Genesis, Job opens not necessarily in time or space as we think of it, but somewhere else entirely. And that's kind of a helpful cue with the way the books of the Bible are ordered in terms of understanding that, all right, not only is this set somewhere different, but Job just feels different from a literary sense. If you had no clue and you didn't know anything about the Bible or how it's structured or anything, you just started reading through it and you're like, all right, there's first second chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, all of it feels like story. Well, after that, things feel different. There's a break. Now we're into a whole new genre of literature and we're bouncing around to different places in time. Job doesn't read like a story. So this then is the first book in a new section of the Bible, a subsection of the Old Testament that smart, fancy people refer to as wisdom literature. It's not pure narrative. It's not pure history. This is people interacting with the reality of God through poetry and prose and song and philosophy and proverbs and reflection. And what we get in Job is a pretty unique genre. It's just a little bit of story mixed with tons of hypothetical dialogue and reflection. Now we see this type of genre in Greek philosophy where you'll have a thinker or a hypothetical thinker interacting with an idea and having an imagined debate back and forth. This is how Plato famously captured the essence of his teacher Socrates and wrote about him after the fact. This is how Justin Martyr, the early Christian author probably wrote his famous dialogue with Trifo. If you don't know what those things are, just bring them up as other historical examples of this somewhat unusual genre that again is going to be very jarring when you're just cruising through the Bible and you get to Job. So let's talk about what actually goes down here. It opens with a bunch of celestial beings. I don't know what to call them. They're participants in a conversation that's happening in the throne room of God. Like God is holding court or something. I don't think what we're reading here is supposed to be understood as a literal description of how things work in the heavenly realms. And for that matter, I'm not even sure that we're getting any kind of literal description of a literal thing that actually happened to a guy in the book of Job. And I think the original audience, whenever that was, would have been very clear one way or the other on whatever is going on here. But this scenario that's put before us, whatever you make of it has God being like, you know, who's pretty great as Job. He's a very faithful servant and Satan's like, yeah, but that's only because you're always nice to him and Satan's like, raise your hand against him. Make him suffer and you'll see what he's actually made of. And so God, interestingly, isn't like, okay, I will punish him. Instead, God removes his hand, his edict of protection that for whatever reason up till this point, he's bestowed upon Job and his household. And he allows pain and suffering and evil that was wanting to happen anyway to go unchecked for a minute against Job. And the results are terrifying and horrible. God sets a boundary condition here that Satan or the accuser, as he's literally called here, can't actually lift his hand against Job. And remember, there's sort of a contest, a question here that is initiating all of this. So Job has to live through it to find out what really he makes of God's justice and whether God rules the world the right way. And so it's a very odd setup as Job has basically everything taken from him and all of this suffering compounds with his wife to saying, you've got to give up on God, curse God and just die. It's over. But Job won't curse God. He will, however, heavily question God. And the majority of the book is carried out in this dialogue I've been alluding to where three of his buddies show up, a guy named Eliphaz the Temenite, Zophar the Nemethite and Bill Dad, the shoe height. Now, this is a good place to pause and acknowledge that nobody knows when this story is happening. We've got some location names that maybe fit kind of with where this is supposed to occur. Some people think that this is set during the age of the kings or maybe even during the exile because Job a couple of times references known Proverbs and Psalms. But other people think this is maybe the oldest book in the Bible that it's referencing something way back from the time of Abraham or even earlier. So we don't know where this is happening. We don't know when this is happening. That clearly isn't the point of the book. And if anything, the lack of clarity on those questions just accentuates how universal these questions are, the experience of suffering and wrestling with the idea that we're here were made. Clearly something made this. Clearly it's still attended to her. It would spiral to chaos. And so there's some kind of order or justice to all of this, but it seems like what just happened to me or this other person is not just. So how does that work? That's a very universal question. And the author of this book, I think does a very clever thing in disguising some of those specifics so that we won't fixate on that as an audience. What we can say about the author of this book is that this is a very well-rounded thinker who's apparently quite conversant in literature and science and philosophy and theology. And all of that is brought to bear, especially moving forward from chapter three as we get into this big dialogue section that occurs. Well, these friends who show up are maybe doing their best, but they're all operating from an assumption that skews their ability to offer proper comfort and help Job out. Their assumption is all the ground rules of everything are kind of like the Mosaic covenant. If you're good, God blesses you. If you're bad, God punishes you. Job is good. Even God affirms this at the very beginning. So why on earth would he be getting punished? Well, the only conclusion that these three friends can come to is somehow you must have got something wrong. But Job isn't down with that and he goes through this whole cycle of conversation. They say something. He refutes it because Job is on a journey. He's wrestling with an idea and what Job of a chapter in the teens is wrestling through is going to be really different than what Job in a given chapter in the twenties is going to be wrestling through. You have to read this one as a whole to track carefully the flow of thought and the real deep water grappling with this question that is among the most important and complex that people try to deal with. Job doesn't arrive at the same conclusion as his friends. He's like, no, I'm blameless. I'm telling you I'm blameless. Quit trying to pin something on me to make your worldview work. And all Job can come up with knowing in his heart that he is blameless is that maybe God just isn't as good as he thought God was. In a way, the friends all represent what would have been a popular answer to the question of suffering back in the day and really all three of them, you can kind of attach to popular answers to the question of suffering today as well. And all three of the friends solutions as well as really Job's solution to the problem of suffering turn out to be a dead end. Well, then as we get toward the end of this dialogue sequence, another friend shows up and his name is Elohiu, the Bousite and he's apparently younger than the other guys. And so he's like, well, I waited to speak because they're older than me. And Elohiu gives a more thoughtful take on why suffering occurs. It's a little bit more noble, if you will. He's like, well, maybe God's trying to teach you something. And I think even in this day and age of all of the different takes that are offered in this section of Job regarding suffering, that's the one that's probably the most popular. But if you really think about that, and you will, if you haven't yet, as life goes on and you suffer more and you watch other people suffer more, there are some problems with that as a catch all solution to the problem of evil as well. And so we come out of this dialogue phase saying, okay, the three friends initially, they didn't really knock it out of the park. And Elohiu, he gave a better, more mature answer. And Job, I mean, he's the one who's actually suffered. He's just an emotional mess, but still trying to do right. But we don't have the problem of evil solved. And so then around chapter 30, Job appeals to God. He's like, my friends can't answer the question. I've tried to wrestle it through. I can't answer the question. I want answers on this. I'm innocent and I've been mistreated. What the heck God? And then crazily God shows up and answers his question. Well, that's the billion dollar thing, right? That's what we all want when it comes to the problem of pain and suffering is God to come and make it clear. Tell me why. Effectively, God's answer is you're not equipped to understand that. It doesn't seem like God is totally offended by the question, but he quickly disabuses Job of the notion that he's entitled to an answer on that. And he does so by talking about his great power and the scope of things, down from little details in nature to the grand scheme of how the cosmos turns and functions. And then he goes into this segment where he talks about these two remarkable creatures. Maybe there's some creature that still exists that we're aware of. Maybe there's some kind of now extinct megafauna, but these creatures, God references the Leviathan and the Behemoth. What they have in common is they demonstrate the wild power and apparent chaos and danger of the physical world of existence. And God's ultimate point is, Job, you simply aren't capable of running the equation of my justice or lack thereof. He even offers Job sort of this Damoclean bargain. Again, a few episodes back, we talked about the sort of Damocles and that Greek myth or legend. And he's like, okay, Job, well, what would it be like if you ran the show? Would you be able to zip around all day and just punish everybody who did something bad? And God's point is it's not that simple. There's a ripple effect to all of it. And neither you nor any human nor all the humans combined, paraphrases very much mine, are capable of even starting to scratch the surface of running such moral ethical justice calculations. You can't do it. And I'm limited by nothing. So I guess I could just sit here forever and explain it to you. But there's no chance of you understanding it because you simply aren't in a position to do so as a finite mortal. And ultimately the conclusion seems to be reasonable question, Joe, but when you really stop and think about it, your only option here is to trust in my justice. That isn't as neat and tidy as the proposals that the three friends throughout, which is you must have just done something naughty that maybe you forgot about or something. It's not even as neat and tidy as the more noble sounding solution that L.A.H.U. offers, which is what he's trying to teach you a lesson. And God's answer at the end maybe isn't even a satisfying from a human perspective is Job's noble quest of wrestling it through. But it is God's answer. And Job sees that he's right. He bends the knee and withdraws his complaint. And then in the final scene, God restores to Job that which was taken from him. I think it's right and appropriate that Job is positioned in our Bibles as the first of the wisdom books because thematically the big point is you're not going to get everything, but trusting in the wisdom of God, the judgment of God, the rightness of God is the wisest thing you can do. It's the best bet you've got for getting things right and navigating the complexities of life and death and justice and suffering in this world in general. When you picture Job, picture a guy completely disheveled, covered in ashes and in mourning and friends gathering around him to have a long dialogue about how he found himself in that state. When you think about the theme of Job, think about trusting in God's judgment and God's wisdom. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, read chapters 38 through the end of the book so you can hear God's answer to the question of suffering in its entirety. And with that, there's another level up for both of us. We got Job next time around onto the Psalms. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Psalms. We're talking about the book of Psalms in a format like this is going to expose me, because pretty much everything we've done up until this point, I felt like, if I didn't catch the matrix, the pattern to what's going on in this book on the first read-through, I think I can get it on the second. A couple of them took me a third. Psalms? I'm just going to level with you. I had to call in help. I've read this book several times over the course of my life, and I've been moved by this ancient collection of poems and songs, but there's just so much here that other than the obvious structure, which is it's divided up into what's labeled as five books. Other than that, it's really hard for me to see the pattern on this and the matrix on this one. So this time around, I straight up went out and consulted some resources to be like, just typically, how do people divide this book up and what do they see going on structurally and let me tell you? It was incredibly one humbling because I didn't immediately see it myself. And two, helpful because what I'm discovering now that it's been pointed out to me is there's some pretty amazing thought that went into not just how the Psalms were written, but how they were assembled and built out and ordered and organized by whoever did this work. Well, right off the bat, Psalms stands out as being a pretty cool book because you've got so many authors kicking in on it. And we actually know the names of several of them. Obviously, David is a famous psalmist. He wrote probably almost half of these. And then Moses, Solomon show up, some other named authors also contribute even multiple Psalms. And then there's a bunch of these that are just anonymous. I think it's kind of fun to sit around and imagine which characters we've encountered through the story of the Old Testament and maybe wrote some of these really beautiful heartfelt Psalms and kind of bear their souls to us, but we just don't get to know who it is. So I think the multitude of contributors makes Psalms pretty unique and pretty cool, but also the very important role that the editor, the assembler of this book plays makes Psalms very interesting. I think that's a very unique facet of this. Somebody and smart people believe that it was somebody during that Persian exile period we've been talking about, like with Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther. Somebody during that time was like, hey, we got all of this rich tradition of music and poetry and prose and verse from across the centuries of the story of our journey as the chosen people of God. Somebody needs to organize that stuff up in a way where it's all accessible and bound up into one thing, but also somebody needs to organize that stuff up in a way that orders it such that it tells the story that it communicates and emphasizes the big theological points. It looks like somebody thought to themselves, we should put as much theological care and crafting thought into how we select and organize these Psalms as was put into writing them in the first place. And so again, this structure is something that was not immediately evident to me, and I had to go and dig around. But what I found is that there's pretty much universal agreement amongst smart people who do this for a living that this is how it works. Chapters one and two sometimes get lumped into book one out of five, I mean, five big books. That's how Psalms overtly is structured. But Psalms one and two probably sit outside the boundaries of book one and serve as a thematic introduction to two big ideas. One is the idea of reflection that the law of the Lord and all of the stories you and I have looked at up till this point going through the Bible is something that's like a lifetime. Commitment, you reflect on that intellectually, but you also reflect on that at the level of the heart. And in a way, this is communion with God. That's emphasized in Psalm one, Psalm two takes us right back to that promise that was made in Chronicles and Samuel to David, where you'll recall David was like, Oh God, this is great. I want to build you a house, a temple. And God says, I'm going to have your descendants do that, but instead I'm going to build you a house. It's going to be a royal house and there's going to be this great eternal king who will sit on this great eternal throne. Well, Psalm two emphasizes that this idea of expectantly looking forward to the deliverance that is going to come through that promised Messiah who is descended from David. And now that I've had somebody pointed out to me, I totally see this repetition in this pattern through the five books of Psalms, but each of these books in its own way really deals with these two themes, reflection on God. Sometimes that's poetically demonstrated in all of God and praise of God. Sometimes it's demonstrated in reflection on the behavior of God or even wondering about how God will deal with things that are very problematic and hurtful in the world. So there's that reflection on the law on the story of God and his chosen people in each of these books, but then there's also some element of looking forward to that promised Messiah in each of these books. And then when you look closer at each of these books, you find that there's symmetry within each of these five books as well. So book one is Psalm three to Psalm 41. There's a whole lot of David in here. And there's a whole lot of songs of hurt and heartache songs of lament. Psalms where the Psalmist expresses their desperation before God. My enemies are doing this to me. Give me deliverance. And in the early going here, like book one, you get a few songs of celebration of God kind of sprinkled in there as well, but it's pretty heavily weighted toward those songs of personal reflection and lament, even anger and aggravation toward the Psalmist's enemies. But in all of, for example, book one, you get this heavy emphasis on David as this precursor as this type of the Messiah who is to come later. In book two, you get a little bit more of the stuff about praise and celebration of God and a little bit less of the lament business. But again, the emphasis is heavily on this Messianic king who is to come and how that Messianic king isn't just the fulfillment of a promise to David, but it's a fulfillment of the promise to Abraham. And the promise of a redemptive plan in general going all the way back to the beginning. And then book three, which is pretty short focuses more on the kingdom that is promised and all the hope that lies with that in contrast to the circumstances in which this stuff is being assembled, that being exile and not having a true kingdom or any kind of independence sounds like a very modern term. But I think you know what I mean by the time we get to book four, which is Psalms 93, 106 again, pretty short, we've seen that lament and hurt and heartache theme really taper off. And now we're getting more heavily into that optimism theme about God's glory and God's rain and God's people being rallied together to see that and to celebrate that. And it highlights how all of that hope is possible because the promise to David is unconditional. God is going to redeem the Messiah thing is going to happen one way or another. And then book five is gargantuan and has a whole lot of internal structure with the massive Psalm 119 being the centerpiece of all of it. And this section of the Psalms is the section that gets quoted a ton in the New Testament in particular Psalm 110, something Jesus alludes to, I think, more than any other Psalm. And the reason for that is because now we're in full throated praise mode. God in his glory, God is king, God is conqueror, God is the one who does not forget his people. God is the one who redeems is like, this is an anticipatory celebration of all of the payoffs of everything that has been promised throughout that Old Testament story that we've been looking at. And then the last five chapters are like the grand finale of a fireworks show where each massive, beautiful, bright, colorful explosion proclaims the glory of God and his praises in one more dramatic fashion until we conclude in Psalm 150. Straight up, I think the book of Psalms is really effective just being read in isolation, but it's way more effective against the backdrop of the Old Testament story. And the same way that in the book of Psalms, there's a whole lot of the problem being emphasized at the beginning and a little glimmer of the praise being emphasized early on. But gradually we see the problem emphasis tapering down as we move forward in Psalms and the praise and celebration of who God is in the hope side of things moving up in volume as we move through the Psalms. So that's kind of the pattern of the Old Testament in general that we're seeing here. The further we get into this story, the more it looks like, no, this was a tough road, but God is going to make good on his promises and he's going to deliver. When you visualize the book of Psalms, imagine David is king in good times with God playing the harp and singing songs of praise to God. But also imagine David on the run out in the wild scratching out lyrics to this poem in the dirt while he's in a state of deep despair and tremendous duress under both circumstances. He's calling out to God and bearing his heart. When you think about the theme of Psalms, think about heartfelt celebration of the glorious attributes of the great God of everything, the maker of all things, the one who doesn't forget his promises and the one who will redeem. If you don't have time to read all of Psalms and you're already relatively familiar with Psalm 23, read Psalms 1, Psalm 2 and Psalm 110. And with that, my friends, we have leveled up and I really feel like I leveled up on this one. I'm seeing the matrix on Psalms better than I ever have, so thank you for forcing me to do this simply by narrative. You're being here and being interested. That is a favor to me and I'm very grateful. Alright, Proverbs next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Proverbs. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. Today we're talking about the book of Proverbs, and I think this one is straightforward with a couple of caveats. At the most basic level, this is a compendium. It's a collection of wise sayings that are not promises or guarantees about how everything's going to work out if you do this, then this will always happen. But the genre was understood by the original audience to be best practices, to be guidelines for wise and right living in relationship to God, in relationship to self, in relationship to others, and in relationship to this personified notion of wisdom herself. Solomon is the main character associated with this. So yesterday we looked at Psalms, which is a book that's written by a whole bunch of different people, but we talked about how there was that aggregator. There's a person who made the editorial choices and pulled all of these things together. Somebody was a collector, if you will, of all of the great songs and poems and prose from across the centuries of God's chosen people. Well, likewise here, it looks like Solomon had become a collector of great ideas, a collector of wisdom and truth. Solomon was a pretty international guy. He had relationships with people beyond his own borders. I think it's possible that even some of this wisdom is stuff that he was identifying as having the fingerprint of God, even if it was coming from some outside source. We don't get to know the sources of all of the Proverbs, but they're all held out as being good counsel for right living and for internalizing the values of God and living in a way that is rooted in a healthy respect, even fear of God. Indeed, explicitly one of the key principles here is the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. But if we imagine that the book of Proverbs is just one solid wall of little truisms from end to end, that would be incorrect. Proverbs has some dynamics to it. There's a narrative here, but there are different movements, different things going on, different organizational moments, if you will, throughout the book of Proverbs. And the first organizational moment is a collection of these wise statements that Solomon is imparting to his son. Now, you might be thinking, hmm, it wasn't that long ago that we were just talking about Solomon's reign and the Old Testament. And it seems like his sons didn't do particularly well and by not particularly well. I mean, committed horrible atrocities against their siblings and civil war to the country. It went pretty badly. If this was good advice, the Solomon gave his sons doesn't look like they took it to heart and you're absolutely right. They didn't. So if he gave this advice to them and we're being invited to listen in, so to speak, on that same advice and maybe take it to heart for ourselves, well, what gives? How can we trust all of this? But that brings us back to this larger point. I mean, even very specifically, we got a proverb a little bit further on in here that says, train up your children in the way they should go. And when they're old, they will not turn from it. Solomon's own sons who heard all of these proverbs apparently did turn from it. And I think this potential critique is actually a feature, not a bug identifying this right up front because we start with Solomon and this fatherly advice. And because all the readers of this in the original audience would have known how it went with Solomon and his family, it's not like Proverbs here is trying to pull one over on people and be like, well, hopefully they just forgot about all of that. And they're completely illiterate about the story of their own people. Now this book continued to be popular and to circulate long after everybody knows how things played out for Solomon's family. Instead, I say again, the fact that we open with this is a feature, not a bug because it frames our mind the right way to remember we're not reading the Old Testament law here. We're not reading a prophet who's showing up to tell everybody like, this is what you're doing wrong. You got to turn from these things. We're reading best practices. We're reading simple, memorable distillations of the wisdom of God for rightly interacting with again, God, self, others, the notion of wisdom itself. And usually though there are grand exceptions to this, if you do these things, you got a good shot at stuff going right and things are even probably more likely to work out in good ways for you in a practical sense. Now look, in the case of Solomon and his kid, well, it didn't work out entirely practical sense and these lessons weren't retained, but it doesn't mean it's not good advice. But sprinkle into this opening section of Proverbs is the first nine chapters. We keep running into this personification of wisdom, kind of like the Statue of Liberty is a personification of the idea of liberty. But this lady wisdom character has some prose dedicated to her that is all about this idea that wisdom just is, that there is some kind of order to things, that there is a rightness and that lady wisdom, she's not changing. She's something who calls to you by merit of her mere existence for you to conform to the reality, the greater reality that is her. So as we get done with chapter nine of Proverbs, we're all squared up. We're clear from the Solomon father to son stuff that these are not laws, that these are not somehow prophetic guarantees that you can just take to the bank. If you do this, God owes you that. And that what we're talking about here is something that's somewhat philosophical in nature as well. We're talking about this orienting beacon of truth and wisdom to which people are called to again, orient themselves. The right reader of Proverbs then is going to receive everything that comes next in light of those assumptions. And indeed, what we get next is 19 straight chapters of just straight forward Proverbs. People who like to rib the Bible and offer some healthy critiques that they see here there will often go right to the Proverbs and they'll pick Proverbs from around the book and be like, look, these two seem to conflict. But again, the person who's properly equipped to read Proverbs by orienting themselves using those first nine chapters is going to see those and be like, oh, yeah, but in a given circumstance, that first proverb example that you give that might seem to be in conflict with another, it actually makes sense. But in another context, you got to read the room. That second one is going to make sense. And you have to use judgment even in trying to figure out when to apply, which of these Proverbs to your situation. So there's just a ton of little one off best practice distillations of the wisdom of God throughout Proverbs. And you know what I'm going to do right now? I'm just going to read some of them without planning in any way, whatever we get, whatever we get, Proverbs 15 one. Oh, I know this one. A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. You're going to detect the repeated pattern here real quick. If you don't already know it, let's try Proverbs 19 12. Oh, it's got wrath again. A king's wrath is like the growling of a lion, but his favor like do on the grass. Interesting. Notice in that one, there's not really anything for you to do. It's more of a, hey, read the room and be aware of what's going on kind of Proverb. Know that this is how kings are. Let's try Proverbs 22 nine. Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed for he shares his bread with the poor. This one follows more of that beatitudes structure that we see in Matthew five in the sermon on the mount. Let's try another one. Proverbs 26 one like snow in summer or rain and harvest. So honor is not fitting for a fool. I like that one. It's got teeth. Proverbs 26 24, whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart. Proverbs 27 one do not boast about tomorrow for you don't know what a day may bring. Are you seeing how some of these are just situational awareness? Some of these are very practical. Hey, do this, but don't do that. Others seem to be exhorting someone to right living in a way that has a little bit more delicate touch. Others are offering observations about the state of humanity so that you can recognize patterns and make quick shrewd judgments about what you see going on around you. Look, red wrong even. This is really powerful, useful stuff, but red right that is framed and oriented by the first nine chapters. These proverbs become a treasure trove of wisdom regardless of who you are or when you're reading it or how old you are, what circumstances you're facing. And then in chapter 30, we get a little section that I had kind of forgotten about until I read through this again. There's proverbs or there's a statement from somebody named Agor. I don't know who this is, but right off the bat, he comes off like a really sympathetic character to the reader because he's somebody who's like, I would like to have more wisdom and I'd like to understand how to sort through things. And through his words in chapter 30, you get a sense of here's the right way to orient yourself through humility and attentiveness and fear of the Lord to reading the proverbs correctly. So it's kind of like a built in interpretation guide right there in chapter 30. And then the final chapter 31 comes from someone named King Lemuel. I don't know who he was king over, but this is where we get the famous remarks about another beautiful, elegant lady who is held out as a beacon of virtue and wisdom. And this is the woman of noble character. And on a personal note, I really appreciate reading through this chapter because I'm married to one of those. And that has been one of the greatest joys and blessings of my life. This is awesome. The only way it gets sideways and gets into being a little bit of a weird read is if you read it kind of like Job's friends and you're like, wait a dang minute, God, you said in this turn of a phrase that if I did X, you would give me why. And instead I did X and you gave me Z. What the heck? What gives? Well, if you want to sort that through, go read Job or Ecclesiastes that we're going to get to soon. It's not like the Bible doesn't speak to what happens when you run into an exception to these proverbs. It speaks to it in great depth. It wrestles it through with tremendous transparency and honesty. And if you remember the conversation from Job, the conclusion is ultimately you're going to have to trust in the wisdom and justice of God. But there's an acknowledgement that God sees that those outliers would be disorienting. That said, just because there are outliers to what we see in Proverbs should do nothing to diminish the best practice reality of these timeless distillations of the wisdom of God. When you visualize the book of Proverbs, picture that lady wisdom character from the first nine chapters, when you think about the theme of Proverbs, think about wisdom applied. And if you don't have time to read the whole book, go and check out Proverbs one seven and then pick any random 25 Proverbs from chapters 10 to 29 and just see what you get. Boom. And with that, we have leveled up on the book of Proverbs, you and I, and next time around, we're going to see if we can level up the book of Ecclesiastes. Thanks for doing this with me. I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Ecclesiastes. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. Thanks for hanging out with me and talking about the book of Ecclesiastes, which I've been sitting here thinking about it, so I can already tell my tone is different than it normally is on these because it's so somber and reflective, and this book has resonated with me and touched my heart at every point of my story as a person, because it deals with the question that everybody asks at some point, not even at some point, at multiple points over the course of their life, but we ask this question in different ways over the course of our lives, and that question is, what's the point? What am I doing here? What is all of this activity I'm engaged in even mean? Even the beautiful stuff about life even mean. Ecclesiastes is part of the wisdom and writing literature of the Old Testament, along with Job, Psalms and Proverbs, and then Ecclesiastes, and then the Song of Songs or Song of Solomon. Now, on the surface, it looks like Ecclesiastes is holding itself out as being written probably by Solomon. This is the opening line. The words of the preacher or the teacher, the son of David, King in Jerusalem. They're on in the book, the first person author talks about how they were wiser than anybody else and all of their achievements and money and wealth, and they talk about the holiness of that stuff. So it really does seem to line up that this is Solomon, which can then cause the reader to be like, well, probably the companion book in this wisdom literature to Ecclesiastes then would be Proverbs, because they both look like they have a whole lot of Solomon in them, but I don't think that's the case. I think the companion book of Ecclesiastes is Job, but where Job tackles the suffering end of things, Ecclesiastes is tackling another difficult emotion, but it's one that can be born out of the exact opposite of suffering. It's one that can be born out of everything going great. Ecclesiastes is tackling that numb feeling, that melancholy that can set in even when we're getting the things we want, but then quickly realize this isn't satisfying. This is a very real part of the entire human experience, at least after early childhood, and it would be weird if the Bible never tackled that. So high five Bible, great job for dealing with the big questions that people deal with in a way that we can relate to, and in a way that isn't weird and preachy. Ecclesiastes comes alongside you no matter where you're at in life, no matter what is prompted you to ask the question, what's the point? And it puts an arm around you and is like, hey, I get it. We all get to that question at some point. Welcome. Let's think about it together and I'll honestly share my experiences with you, says the author of Ecclesiastes. But the bigger question on the front end for understanding Ecclesiastes is what do you do with this one word that is clearly the hinge word, the theme word of the whole thing? It's a word that the original audience would have understood, or else this book wouldn't have stood the test of time. Nobody would have got it. Nobody would have resonated with it. But it is apparently pretty difficult to translate, and this word is Hevel. The English versions of the Bible I read when I was a kid translated this word Hevel as meaningless. So then Ecclesiastes would open saying meaningless, meaningless says the teacher. Everything is meaningless. What does a man get from all of his toil? And then in other translations that I read now, I see this word being rendered as vanity. But then somewhere along the way in school somebody pointed out to me that this word Hevel just means vapor, just something incorporeal that you can see and it's there and it's real. But you cannot grab it. You can't take hold of that. And I got to tell you, I feel that Hevel thing so deeply. I have these weird emotions from time to time where I'll be so overcome with the beauty of a thing that the thought that I can't hold it and keep it will bring me to tears. I don't think I'm a fragile person. I don't cry at the drop of a hat, but every now and then this Hevel thing gets me. I had a beautiful dinner with a dear friend in a beautiful place to celebrate his birthday. Just two of us sitting down. And at the end of the meal I cried. I had to apologize, but the best I could explain it was I just value our friendship so much. And I just am overwhelmed by the beauty of this place and reflecting on the miles we've covered together and the miles that we have ahead of us together as friends. Unfortunately, he was really understanding and nice about it. I cried one time after a deep, beautiful, meaningful conversation with my wife, just because it occurred to me. I won't be able to have these forever in the same context in the same way. This is one of the most tender, meaningful things I'll ever know in my entire existence, but I can't hold it. Watching my daughter play piano at a recital the other day. Same thing, why am I crying? I mean, the performance is beautiful, the art is beautiful, but I'm crying because of Hevel. I wrestle with my kids, I hit the tennis ball around with them, I put my arms around them, and watch some silly TV show at night and I'll find myself misting up because I can't hold this forever because Hevel. I go stand in a stream in the mountains and I catch a beautiful brook trout with amazing colors and I lift it out and I have that moment of contact with another living thing. From a totally different world, we should never have this moment of touch, and yet we do for just a moment. And before the water on it dries, I put it back in the stream and let it go. And I feel this deep sense of emotion that even though physically I could touch that, I can't keep it. I relate to Job because I relate to suffering. I've dealt with hard things, not things like Job dealt with, but I relate even more to Ecclesiastes because of how much I've been blessed and how much beauty I've seen in my life and how much it hurts my heart that I can't hold it and I can't own it. But here's what's awesome about that. And here's where I think I resonate with the author of Ecclesiastes, or maybe he resonates with me, is that inability to hold it according to the book of Ecclesiastes is good. It's meant to prompt you toward a thing that you can hold. It's meant to prompt you toward something that is truer and realer and lasting. Thank you for indulging me on that. I realize I got wildly personal. Well, Ecclesiastes gets it and that's evident in the structure. It opens with one of the two things that make this heavy vapor phenomenon a reality, and that is the passage of time. It deals with that question. And then in basically the last section before the little conclusion at the very end, it deals with mortality. The other thing that makes heavy a reality from our perspective. And in the middle, it deals with the obvious response in light of time and death. What do you do? What can you chase down? Where can you find that meaning? And it goes through and basically the author says, I tried this, I tried this, I tried this, I tried this, you can too. But ultimately it all fails to satisfy this. Nothing, not money, not fame, not power, not sex. Nothing can make that which you cannot truly hold. Nothing can take that vapor and make it something that you own and that you have and that you can count on forever. And that's maybe why some people have translated this heavy word meaningless. But again, I don't think that's the best translation because it's not meaningless. It's the very fact that it is so meaningful, but so fleeting and not apprehensable that makes it powerful and that creates this melancholy reflection that people like me go through. So it looks like the way the book is setting up as we get through the middle of it and toward the second half is like, okay, we got the whole thing, it's framed by time and mortality. And here's some constructive proposals that are bad. And now we're going to get the constructive proposal that is trite and good. And indeed in the second half of the book, we pivot toward a constructive proposal. This sounds more like the one that we got from L.A. Hugh, the Bousite from Job, where it's like, all right, well, the answer is like God and Christianity and religion, like believe in God more and do more godly things. And then that will work. But then in this surprise move from the teacher, the author we're hearing from here, he's like, that's kind of vapor too. Wait, what? God is vapor? Christianity is vapor? The Bible is vapor doing good things. What are you talking about, man? But the point he seems to be making is even that in this lifetime, you can't truly hold. You have it, but time and mortality still march on, and only God is truly holding and owning all of these things that for us are constantly slipping through the fingers. Now don't get me wrong, he's by no means saying, oh, there's no answers in God or anything, so forget that. Rather, he's saying that when you are bound to this physical body with death awaiting you on the horizon, there's just only so much you're ever going to be able to take hold of anything, even the things of God. Ultimately, God owns that and putting your trust in God, much like the conclusion of Job, the teacher in Ecclesiastes is then saying, your only play here is to trust in God, because only God truly owns things, only God can truly put something in his hand. Only God paraphrases mine now, but I think it's there. Only God can take hevel and make it something that is forever, something that is apprehendable. Rather than the teacher's counter-proposal to all of the other proposals is to trust God, to drink deeply of God's good gifts and to take those good gifts in this lifetime, even though we can't fully apprehend them to take those in anticipation as a first fruit of a more realized and eternal goodness that comes later at the hands of God. And whether that's comfortable or not, this is the only way in a reality where all is hevel. The reiteration of this in the little epilogue that we get at the end of chapter 12, where the teacher points us to God's justice and judgment and that one day all of this will change, but that that's beyond our control. And the teacher also says, hey, my friend, big time paraphrases mine here. There's only so far you can go with all of this. Don't take your whole life and become a slave to this question. So he urges the reader to make the pivot, to understand the nature of this reality, and for that to urge the reader toward knowing God, trusting God, and to understand that God transcends hevel. When we get to the New Testament, we're going to see that the apostle Paul wrestled with this and seemed to understand it. In Philippians 3, he famously says that he hasn't been able to obtain this thing that he's pursuing, but that he presses on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of him. In 1 Corinthians 13, he famously talks about knowing in part and prophesying in part with the indication that he understands that the things of the right now are hevel, but that is not permanent in God. And heck, there's even that hymn that says, God haste the day when my faith becomes sight. So Ecclesiastes is important beyond just this deep existential set of questions that you and I ask, it undergirds a right understanding of living in this world while in relationship with God and anticipating eternity with God under a very different set of ground rules. When you visualize the book of Ecclesiastes, picture vapor solidifying in the hands of God. When you think about the theme, let me let's just go with the main phrase, all is hevel. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, catch the opening segment about time in chapter 1, the almost closing segment about mortality in chapter 11 and into chapter 12, and then read the resolution that we were just talking about that runs on through the end of the book at the end of chapter 12. All right, it sounds a little trite to say given how deep the water of Ecclesiastes is, but achievement unlocked? I think we just leveled up together. I know every trip through Ecclesiastes is the new most meaningful trip I've ever had through Ecclesiastes, and that was the case again this time. So thanks for being on the other end of this to push me to do that. I really appreciate it. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Song of Solomon. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and I have a question for you. What to do with Song of Songs, or Song of Solomon, as it's sometimes called? That's the book we're looking at today. This is an oddball. Well, at least at first glance it's an oddball, because it just looks like it's a collection of poetry about romance and deep passionate love, including physical attraction and physical intimacy. But when you look closer at it, you discover that you were right. It is exactly all of those things. So why would that be in the Bible, which is a story about God's redemptive plan? And I'm content to just let that tension, that question hang out there, until we've had a chance to look at the raw material of what we can say for sure is definitely going on on the pages of this book, which again, sometimes it's called Song of Solomon, sometimes it's called Song of Songs. The reason it's called Song of Solomon is the opening line, which is the Song of Songs, which is Solomon's. And of course, understandably, the most natural assumption when you look at that, and indeed this has been my assumption my whole life until my last few readings of this book is that Solomon must have written this. And we're about to probably get some kind of love poetry or love song that is written from Solomon's perspective, that is expressive of him falling in love, meeting somebody. And as you read through it for the first time, you're like, well, yeah, that's what it looks like it is. There's a young lady in this story. There's a young man in this story. And we meet them after they're already past the point of discovering initial interest in each other. These two are really into each other. And it looks like they both live in some sort of pastoral environment where they both are involved in the keeping of sheep or flocks in some way, which means they go where their flocks go. And as the flocks wander, they are separated. And then they find themselves looking for each other and longing for each other. And they find themselves delighting when they find each other again. It's like there's a cycle going on with each of these poems or songs within the song of Solomon where their passion and joy upon rediscovering each other at the end of a day or a week or a cycle of going out and grazing with the sheep and looking after them where that joy bubbles to the surface and they just can't wait to see each other and express how they're feeling about it. Like, I don't know what your life was like when you were a kid and you had a crush or maybe if you're married, when you were starting to deeply fall in love with that person, but I still have handwritten notes that I received from my wife. And they still make my heart race when I read them. We went to college together, but we lived in different states and we were separated for huge chunks of time. And during that time, I found myself missing her heart and her personality and her beauty. And thinking about who she was and what she looked like and trying to capture those emotions of yearning and letters that I wrote back to her as well. I need to get back to where Solomon fits into all of this, but at the most basic level, you got a lady and you got a dude and their work seems to take them apart from each other and they can't stop thinking about each other. And when they get back together, these songs seem to represent them pouring out their heart. What the book doesn't give us is a crystal clear narrative, though. In the beginning, it looks like they're not married and the scenes never quite take us to the place of the marital bed. Eventually, it looks like they do get married and then it looks like that relationship is consummated at that point. That may just be the arrangement of the poems, but that order of business would seem to be in keeping with the assumptions of the rest of the Bible about the ideal for marriage and physical intimacy for God's people. But to try to reduce this thing down to some sort of lesson about the right way to court someone and the right way to do marriage and how physical intimacy ought to be conducted, I think you can see that in other parts of the Bible, but I don't think that is strongly on display here. I think instead what we're getting is a profound celebration of this super important God-given part of the human experience. How can you have a wisdom section in a Bible that holds itself out as being from God if you don't address this deep water powerful part of the human experience? But back to the Solomon thing. Every time I read it prior to the last few times, I've just assumed like, well, this is from Solomon's perspective. This must be when he met his wife or, well, as we know from reading the book of First Kings, one of his many wives. But the last few times I've read it, I've come around to thinking that I don't believe this is written by Solomon or from Solomon's perspective. I think this is dedicated to Solomon somehow. I think Solomon and his reputation are being drawn upon as a poetic and literary setting. This is wisdom literature in the style of in the flourishing wisdom literature era of Solomon. And then I think Solomon is introduced into the story in a few different moments to maybe even contrast the Kingly understanding of love, maybe even love out of obligation with the real true discovery of love, the exclusive love that the young man and the young woman in this story represent. After Solomon gets mentioned in this opening line, we don't hear from him again until almost halfway through the document when it looks like he shows up at the wedding. But what we get running up to that is a whole lot of screen time, like I've been talking about between this young man and this young woman. And they're just saying what they think of each other and what they want to do with each other. And they're using similes and metaphors that I found very confusing and off-putting when I was a kid because the things that they like and the others physical attributes to, this is hard for me to picture how that would be attractive. But somewhere along the way, books or school or whatever, smarter people have pointed out to me that this genre of poetry from this era didn't tend to draw on literal visual comparisons, but instead draws on something a little less obvious about whatever that comparative is to praise the beauty or the attractiveness or strength of the other person. And a great example of this happens in chapter four when he is talking about her teeth and he likens them to a bunch of shorn-use like sheep. Teeth don't look like sheep, bro. But then you read a little further and you're like, Oh, I get what he's talking about in an ancient world context, especially a context that was informed for these two by the fact that they worked around sheep. He says, your teeth are like a flock of shorn-use that have come up from the washing, all of which bear twins and not one among them has lost its young. What he's saying is you beautiful woman, you have all your teeth and I find that very attractive. I'm sure having all your teeth was not a foregone conclusion at this point in history. And that kind of imagery repeats throughout all of these poems in ways that can be a little disorienting at first, but if you can get past the giggles and really stop and think about why they are drawing these likenesses for each other, then you start to get into the poetry and you start to really appreciate it and even feel connection with these lovers from maybe as much as 3000 years before the time when you and I are reading it. Well, the various little scenes, the little vignettes that we get poetically presented throughout the whole book sort of hang together, but I think it's okay to mostly read them all independently and think of their love like the way you think of any kind of love. It's open-ended. You don't know where this thing is going, but there's always more when you're truly in love with someone and when you're truly plumbing the depths of who that person is and who you are and what you have together. And I think the structure of the book just accentuates that all that much more. There's another scene at the end where Solomon shows up and for me, this little tidbit within the last few verses at the end of the chapter helps really clarify and solidify what's going on here in terms of who is who and where Solomon fits. It looks like Solomon shows up and tries to buy the love of the woman we've been following all the way through this thing, which is kind of gross and mortifying and it seems pretty tacky even in the way that it's presented. We might want to rush to the defense of Solomon who's a Bible hero and be like, he would never do that, but I mean, kind of, I mean, he did have like a gajillion wives and decanquibines and that's again part of the reason. I don't think that this can be a description of Solomon's love. One, because we know who his first wife was. It was an arranged marriage with the daughter of Pharaoh. Nobody was doing any shepherding there. And then after that, things spiral into kind of sexual relational madness for Solomon. This thing at the end seems to be more in keeping with that as he shows up and offers some kind of wealth or influence in exchange for this young woman's love. Maybe the original audience is intended to think, oh, Solomon is trying to get her in the harem, but she stiff arms the king. She's like, no, no, thanks. My vineyard, my very own is before me. You, Solomon, may have the thousand and the keepers of the fruit of 200. And then we just get a little bit more between her and the young man she loves. And that's it. So in that regard, I have to think the original audience would have read this as, at least in part, a contrast between the kind of love that was probably often celebrated at this time and romanticized like, oh, it's the king and this harem. And I mean, it's the most love of all the love. Look, he's got hundreds and hundreds of wives and concubine. That's more and more is better. But the contrast then would be like, is it though? Because look at what these two have. They might not have riches, they might not have all of this other stuff, but they have each other and they mean it. And there's no compulsion. Listen to the way they talk about this. This is the ideal of what love is really about. But that brings us back to that big glaring question I threw out a little bit earlier on. Why is this in the Bible? I think I'm content to say it's in the Bible because this is wisdom literature and wisdom literature deals with the reality of the lived experience of being a human in this world as God's redemptive plan is playing. And this is a huge part of it. And this is a book that's dedicated to it. Honestly, for me, that's enough. But the idealization of love here does harken back to a time before everything got cheapened and wrecked by sin, a time that we looked at when we were going through the book of Genesis back at the very beginning. Could this be intended as a nod, a yearning to when relationships could be even deeper and more profound and unbroken and even more naked and honest before each other, even more lasting? Maybe that is present on these pages. Is it some sort of metaphor for the love between God and his chosen people? Or as Christians have often treated it as a metaphor for the love between Christ and his church? I don't think so. It doesn't look like that overtly. I suppose anytime though you see imagery depicting beautiful, profound, unflinching, deep love that withstands difficult tests that serves as a metaphor for the love between God and his people, the love of Christ for his church. So I suppose it's there. I just don't see anything that overtly points to that. Come on, if you've been going through the Bible with me, you know that I see things that are pointing to Jesus all over the place in the Old Testament. Here, I just don't think we have enough to say, oh, yeah, that's the purpose of the whole book. And honestly, I think those interpretations over the centuries just came about because people were uncomfortable with the subject matter of the book and they wanted to do something to make it a little less giggly and uncomfortable. We often lament the state of the world today and how bad things are, and I get it, I feel that sometimes too. But maybe one of the benefits of this odd little moment we live in is that we're better positioned to appreciate this for what it looks like it was intended originally to be, which at its core is a celebration of God's generous gift of love and physical intimacy. I know I am grateful for those gifts. When you visualize Song of Songs, picture a young, beautiful shepherdess and her young, handsome shepherd lover embracing near their flocks. When you think about the point, think about a celebration of love, attraction, and physical intimacy. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, find a way. Because this one really needs to be read, beginning to end to appreciate it, and it's a pretty quick read and a pretty profound read. And with that, double achievement unlocked because we not only just finished Song of Solomon, but we also just completed the wisdom literature section of the Old Testament. And next time around, we're on to the Prophets and the Book of Isaiah. Alright, I'm Matt, this is The 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Isaiah. We're into a new chunk of the Bible starting today. When you turn the page from Song of Songs to Isaiah, you aren't just turning the page from one book to another, you're turning the page from one genre to another. So far we've made it through three genres in the Old Testament. The first five books of the Bible associated with Moses, those are the Pentateuch. Then we get all of the history books that come after that, and then you get the wisdom literature that we've been looking at for the last few days, the Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, etc. Now we're into the prophets, and right off the bat, that term prophet is going to conjure different things for different people. But I think the most common association with that term is the idea of predictivity that prophets know the future. They know things that they couldn't possibly know, and the only reason they know it is because of some kind of revelation from beyond, from the divine. And in storytelling and fiction, fantasy, things like that, you'll have the role of the prophet. In Shakespeare, you have the role of the prophet. In paganism, you have the role of the prophet. And most often there, again, we see that role being defined by the prophet's ability to know things I couldn't possibly know, and somehow being tapped into a source of knowledge from beyond the physical world to predict stuff. But in the Old Testament, that is just one minority feature that the prophets display. This office, this role of the prophet in the Old Testament, consistently comes with somebody being raised up by God to say difficult, brave things to people who usually don't want to hear it. But it isn't just predictive, in fact, I think the most common thing you see from the prophets in the Old Testament are statements of blessing and statements of judgment, guidance from God. They speak with authority to reveal God's perspective on things to a king, to a royal court, to the people, to the assembly, whatever it might be. And only occasionally in the Old Testament, do we get a hyper specific smoking gun, a highly testable prophecy that says exactly this thing is going to happen in exactly this way with these very specific details. And then you can come back and look at it and be like, well, did that thing happen or did it not a ton of those smoking gun style prophecies that we're going to see as we work through Isaiah and the rest of the prophets have to do with this one who's been hinted at through everything we've looked at through the first three genres of the Old Testament. That being this Redeemer, this promised king, this snake crusher, this one who is to come who's going to straighten things out and reign forever and be the centerpiece of God's redemptive plan for putting back together or maybe even betterifying what was originally there in the garden, but that then broke. So where does Isaiah fit into all of this? Well, he's the majorist of the major prophets. You'll hear people say major prophets and minor prophets that usually just has to do with the lengths of the books associated with these guys. But all of these prophets are associated with at least one king or one moment in the history that we've looked at already in the Bible. So for example, Amos is going to be associated with Jeroboam II. Jose is going to overlap with a ton of the kings of the north, Nehum is going to overlap with Manasseh in the southern kingdom of Judah, but Isaiah is an oddball because at least at first glance, it looks like he covers a massive amount of time overlapping with not only a whole bunch of kings, but also a whole bunch of time in exile. And away what you could say that we get with Isaiah is three big prophetic scenes over the course of the book associated with his name. And the first of those scenes is in chapters one through 39. And in this scene, we see Isaiah doing what most of the prophets do on behalf of God telling the people of Israel of Judah, hey, this isn't going well. This is a mess. This is not what God wants. And the way you guys have built in this case Jerusalem is not going to work out. But there is this long term view presented here of this redemptive view of Jerusalem where everybody's going to show up just like the promise that God made to Abraham and they're going to be blessed through the children of Abraham. They're going to show up at the temple. They're going to learn about God. And there's going to be this vision for this new family of faith that is to come and some others personified in the idea of a new Jerusalem. In the midst of all of that, we meet Isaiah. Now we've already met him if we've read through the Old Testament because he crops up in second Kings in detail as he interacts with Hezekiah and some of the pressure points of Hezekiah's particular reign. But Isaiah shows up and there's this heavenly vision of God being like, man, stuff's a mess. But I got some stuff I need to communicate who will go. And Isaiah is like, wow, I'm not worthy, but I'll do it. I'll go. And then his lips, his mouth are purified symbolically literally. I don't know. I'm not coal the idea being that what he's going to say is very trustworthy. It's been cleansed of the corruption of words that had happened here. And it's in this chunk that we start to run into language that is no longer vaguely pointing to Jesus or hinting at future things about redemption. This is the place in the Bible where we start to get into that Christmas time language, the stuff that you have heard again and again and again, the stuff that you sing in Christmas songs that is predicting much more specifically this future redemption. I think of Isaiah chapter nine. I mean, you've heard this for us, a child is born to us. A son is given in the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace of the increase of his government and of peace, though be no end on the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish it and uphold it. And it's not just me saying like, Oh, come on, they're talking about Jesus. The new Testament says, come on, he's talking about Jesus. I mean, there's one part of Isaiah that Jesus stands up, I think in Luke chapter four and reads from it in a synagogue, and he gets done. He's like, all right, well, today, what you just heard is fulfilled in your sight. He's clearly saying, I am the fulfillment of this stuff that Isaiah laid out that you've been looking forward to. And I'm not even scraping the surface of the Messiah language here in the first 39 chapters of Isaiah, which looked to be written during the later years of the Southern Kingdom of Judah before the Babylonians hauled them away into captivity. There's a more very important image for understanding the Old Testament and New Testament that happens here in the early going of Isaiah. And that's the image of God's judgment against his chosen people exemplified in this tree that gets cut down and all that's left is dead, burnout, trashed stump. More than the promise that comes through Isaiah again with that glimmer of hope motif that we've seen all through the Bible so far is that there's going to be a shoot. There's going to be this little plant that comes up out of that stump that even though it looks completely dead, it's not dead. And it's going to grow up into this great, big, amazing thing. It looks in a way like Jesus is maybe drawing on that imagery in Matthew 13 when he gives the famous parable of the mustard seed and how it grows up into this great tree. And remember what happens when it grows up into that great tree? Critters and creatures and birds, they come and take shelter in it kind of like the imagery Isaiah was giving us about all the nations coming to God to learn about him and to worship. All of this hangs together. And one part that really hangs together is the last chunk of section one of Isaiah, which is chapters 36 through 39 where we get almost an identical blow for blow with stuff that's recorded in the second Kings about Hezekiah and his resistance to the Assyrians and how finally he comes around to trust God and God smites the Assyrian military camp and Judah is spared for the time being. But right after that, Hezekiah makes a big mistake when the Babylonians come to visit and he's like, check out all my money. Look at all of that. You guys aren't into like money or anything though, right? You would never come back and take it. No, no, could we make sure to see all of it though? Yeah, for sure. It's really cool, right? And then Isaiah comes along and he's like, idiot, you can't just flash all your money at great empires. They're going to want it. And I'm telling you, Isaiah says, it's not going to be too long and they're going to come back and they're going to take it and everyone away into exile. And that prediction marks the boundary between the first section of Isaiah and the next section of Isaiah, which runs from chapter 40 to chapter 48. And in this section, it gets a little bit tricky because there's a question of who are we actually hearing from here? Because it's written from the perspective of being in exile in Babylon, but that doesn't make any sense mathematically because of the human mortality and how long people can live. We know the Isaiah of chapters one through 39 is well dead by the time we would historically be in the environment. He's writing from an exile in chapters 40 through 48. Some people look at that and say, well, it's a literary technique. Isaiah is projecting himself into this environment and writing as though he's in that environment. It's going to make a lot more sense when a few years pass and then people go back and read it while they're in exile and they're like, Oh, I totally get what Isaiah was saying now. And that absolutely could be. It could also be that there is this whole school, this whole tradition of thought born out of Isaiah and the people who came after him and studied under him that Isaiah wrote stuff down and maybe handed it on to them. And what we're getting is Christians believe more God inspired commentary from Isaiah's followers in interacting with prophecies Isaiah made back when he was alive. Whatever you make of it, it plays out the same way in the second section. We get details of God's promise about how he's going to do the things we read about in Ezra and Nehemiah where they're going to be liberated and sent back to rebuild the temple and this little spark of hope, this little shoot coming out of this burned out stump of the line of Jesse is going to grow into something much bigger. And now we're getting into the 50s in terms of chapters in Isaiah. And here we get a description of this servant who is going to come and it looks like this is the one who is promised, but the servant weirdly dies and dies at the hands effectively of his own people, the people who should have been excited to see the servant come. But then without any detailed explanation, the servant is alive again, resurrected and people who see what that means. I mean, they read between the lines and they're like, whoa, this is the sign of the coming of the kingdom. Like all the things are being straightened out. They register what's going on and they follow the leadership and the example of the servant, but a bunch of other people like, no, I'm just not into this and they reject him. And Isaiah makes it really clear that the right response is to assume a posture of service to the quote, servant and the wrong response is to reject that servant. All of this, of course, anticipates how we see things shaking out in the gospels and the story of Jesus. Well, then the very last chunk is this wildly hopeful description of the very distant future, the glorious victory of this servant and the arrival of the kingdom of God, the central theme of the book of Matthew. And that's why Matthew draws on Isaiah so much. And the way this victory is going to work out is that there's finally justice for all of the hideous stuff that we've seen so far in the history books of the Bible that we've been looking at. And then all of the horrible stuff that is ensued since then that you and I have read about in history books, that you and I have witnessed ourselves. Finally, that gets addressed and made right and judgment and a reckoning doesn't have to be the job of you and me. God sorts that stuff out. But then alongside that, there are a bunch of other people who also got a whole bunch of things wrong, but they realize they're wrong. They bend the knee to this great king. They become a part of this kingdom and they're a part of this eternal family of faith and worship and celebration of this king and his kingdom. And the whole thing is just like lobbying this gigantic fat, slow, softball forward into history, forward into the Bible to be absolutely knocked out of the park by Jesus and the gospels. Jesus story is recorded in the gospels is prophetic fulfillment on every one of those levels we were talking about at the beginning of our conversation. And Jesus says as much in Matthew 5 17, don't think I've come to abolish the law and the prophets. I didn't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. So he's rounding out the story. He's cleaning up the loose ends. He is the prophetic, predicted fulfillment of all those things that are measurable smoking gun prophecies. And this is especially abundantly clear throughout the beautiful, terrifying, but also hopeful book of Isaiah. When you visualize Isaiah, picture his lips getting purified with that coal, picture the burnout stump of Jesse with a little tiny green chute coming out of it and pictured the mysterious servant, defeating death and establishing this beautiful new kingdom. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, this is going to take a minute, but it's worth it. Read chapters 49 through the end of the book and it's going to set the whole New Testament thing, the whole Jesus thing right up on a tee. I feel like we double leveled up. We get the prophet thing. We got the Isaiah thing. Maybe we triple leveled up because of how much all of this is going to pay off and help us understand the gospels when we get to those. Nice job. High five Jeremiah next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon. This podcast is supported by many of you at patreon.com slash the TMBH podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Jeremiah. You remember how yesterday we were looking at the book of Isaiah, and you kind of come away feeling like, alright, there's some pretty stiff judgment in there, but the balance of it is hope and optimism that goes far beyond the circumstances that are immediately in view. You remember that, right? It's kind of fun, hopeful. Today we're talking about Jeremiah, and just invert all of that ratio. Here there's a glimmer of hope, but more so what we're going to see is a whole lot of judgment. We're going to see one guy, Jeremiah, well, and his helper is scribe Baruch, who supports him and chronicles all of this stuff, pushing back against this tidal wave of foolishness and immorality and hostility from the people of Judah toward their God. You got one guy who is pleading with them not to continue on the course they're continuing on, but when it becomes clear that that's what they're going to do, this one guy is also bold enough to proclaim on behalf of God. There is judgment coming, and it is going to hurt a lot. So Jeremiah is riding toward the very end in the closing years of the Kingdom of Judah. That's the southern kingdom, the one that outlasted the northern kingdom, which you'll recall got defeated by Assyria, but during the lifetime of Jeremiah, Assyria fades into the background and a new threat arises. This is Babylon. While Babylon might not have been quite as vile as the Assyrians, they're bigger, they're more powerful, and they are just as bent on conquest. Some of the prophets we read about in the Old Testament, we get a pretty good accounting of what the terms of their being called to be a prophet were all about. Others all we get is they were a prophet, and then they got to work, and here's what they had to say. With Jeremiah, we get a pretty decent amount of biographical material, and the book of Jeremiah looks like it's a compilation of a whole lot of different styles of literature, of different things that Jeremiah wrote himself about his own life, and recordings of Jeremiah's prophecies, but it also looks like parts of Jeremiah were maybe written by, or at least compiled by this Baruch character who helped him out. There's some pretty high drama and a lot of accounting of the persecution and difficulties Jeremiah goes through as he's continually there as a burr under the saddle of the kings he speaks to, and the culture he's speaking to, nobody really likes what he has to say because it is so withering and so loaded with a terrifying judgment. It's one of those deals where when things go off the rails as badly as they've gone in Jeremiah's context, and he says the thing that is true, even if people know it's true at that point, they're so married to the destructive stuff that got them where they are that it takes a very exceptional person to admit it and repent and acknowledge that this truth teller is actually telling the truth historically, even in a non-religious setting, when the writing is on the wall that a culture is headed for collapse, you generally have this period right before then where everybody is in denial and trying to get everything out of it they can, and they are very angry at people who are pointing out what really is very obvious when you look back at it with the benefit of history that that particular culture's goose was cooked and that their fate was already sealed, it was just a matter of time until that actually played out. So that is the moment in the lifestyle of a kingdom, a people group, a culture that Jeremiah's writing into that he's speaking into, and it's just not a lot of fun, it's not going to make him a popular character. And so in the early going here, the most basic message of Jeremiah is there was a covenant between you, God's chosen people and God, and you have not held up your end of the bargain, and God is now going to hold up his end of that conditional bargain, which means you are going to receive judgment and it's going to hurt. And chief among the examples that Jeremiah points to is the fact that God's chosen people are cheating on him, they go and worship in this beautiful temple that Solomon made and that was dedicated to him and his spirit, and he lives in that temple, but then God's chosen people walk right outside the walls of that temple where they've offered sacrifices, then where the smoke that indicates the presence of God had arrived to dwell with them and fill the air with another kind of smoke, that which occurs when God's chosen people then consigned their own offspring to the flames as an offering, a sacrifice to the detestable Canaanite gods. Yeah, maybe Jeremiah would seem a little too harsh if it weren't for examples like that, scattered throughout the book where you're like, oh my goodness, this isn't just a little religious dispute. He isn't just like, you guys, come on, like my politics better. Come on, guys, come on, let's be nicer. Come on. Now he's talking about something that is fundamentally 100% entirely wickedly evil backwards from what things are supposed to look like for these people in their relationship with God and in honoring the law of God. He goes on to use the imagery of drinking from a cup of judgment, and that cup of judgment is reflected in the power of Babylon. That's going to be God's chosen instrument. The attentive reader to the Gospels will note that Jesus talks about this cup and how the disciples, they weren't ready to drink from this cup, and they're like, no, no, totally we are. Then in that case, the cup is representative of judgment that is intended for others and justly given to others by God, but that is instead poured out upon the servant, poured out upon Christ. Obviously we'll get to that when we get more to the New Testament stuff. As bleak as this all sounds right in the middle of Jeremiah, once again, though, we get language about this coming Messiah, this one who is going to straighten all of this stuff out. The language makes it clear that this straightening out is going to go well beyond a political solution to the mess that God's chosen people have created for themselves, and so as we get into the middle and toward the end of the book, Jeremiah assumes this posture of terrifying chill about all the ugly stuff that is to come. After pronouncing judgment, he calmly explains that this is inevitable, this is going to happen, Babylon is coming, and then he even spells out for them how this judgment is part of God's redemptive plan and tells these future exiles how to live after they get taken, and that's where we get that famous Jeremiah 2911 passage that people often get tattooed on themselves or stencil on the walls of their living rooms, where it famously says, for I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans for welfare and not for evil to give you a future and a hope. That well-known promise comes immediately on the heels of this. For thus says the Lord, when 70 years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place. And then you get the famous words about plans to prosper you and not to harm you, and then it says, then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. And so there's this calm, rational, tender reassurance, almost like a dad, look, I know, not everybody spanks their kids. I got no judgment for that one way or the other. I got spankings when I was a kid, and my calm, rational dad, who was pretty gentle with those spankings when I was little, would sit there with his hand on my butt and he'd be like, son, I love you. Here's exactly what's going to happen. Here's why this is not going to be as hard as I can spank. Here's what you're going to take from this. Here's what's going to happen as soon as we're done with this spanking. And I remember the emotion of that, which was both terror, but also real genuine reassurance of my father's love and clarity on why this was occurring and what I was to take from it. That feels like the tone we're getting right here, even if the example I chose to liken it to might offend a few modern sensibilities. Well, then the last chunk of the book, it flips around and less anybody would be like, well, I guess God also really must like the Babylonians in favor of them. There must be something good about them that we should probably imitate. Nope, nope, nope. Now we get a declaration of judgment against Babylon from Jeremiah, making it clear that Babylon is nothing more than the clumsy, stupid instrument that is deftly wielded in the hands of God to bring about this judgment, but there will also be a judgment against Babylon that is coming. And of course that judgment turns out to come in the form of another nation that God wields deftly, that being the Persian Empire under Cyrus, the great who we've talked about a whole bunch. The book wraps up almost blow for blow with the events of the end of Second Kings, with the failures of the last kings of Judah of the south and the arrival of Nebuchadnezzar and the exile. So within the book of Jeremiah itself, it's not like it's just hanging out there. Like, did it work out? Was Jeremiah right? No, no, within the book of Jeremiah itself, it's made clear. It was right, and Jeremiah, even though he heard from God and was speaking truth to this, he suffers the consequences of the exile as well. His own eyes have to suffer the horror of what happened at that time at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. But then in the final, final little epilogue, little tag at the end of Jeremiah, we see the same thing that we get in the final, final little epilogue tag at the end of Second Kings. And that is that a future king of Babylon, often exile. Remembers a descendant of David, a man who would be king if there was still a kingdom, if there was still Judah, a man named Jehoiachine. And this Babylonian king is like, you know what? You come on out of prison and dine at my table. And that's where it wraps up with this little hint, this little glimmer, this little reminder that God said his promises were still on. Isaiah used the imagery of that cut down tree, that stump of Jesse all burned out, but then a little surprise shoot comes up out of it. And that's where we're going to get our servant. That's where we're going to get our Messiah. That's where the hope comes from. Jeremiah is reiterating the same point here, but he's doing it with the same imagery. That is of this dining scene with the king of Babylon and Jehoiachine, the follow suit from what we get at the end of Second Kings. On the whole, Jeremiah is pretty bleak. There's no getting around it, but the circumstances he was writing to are pretty bleak. I feel bad for this guy. There's a lot of people in the Bible who got roped into some pretty difficult tasks. I'm not sure there are many though that can rival the difficulty of what Jeremiah got called into. When you visualize Jeremiah, picture a whole gigantic crowd of people representing everybody in a culture who doesn't want to hear it, and then picture one guy facing them all and speaking difficult truths directly to them. When you think about the theme, think about Jeremiah's proclamation that God's chosen people violated the covenant and that judgment was coming, but that the Messiah was still coming as well. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go check out Jeremiah 29 through 33, which will get you a whole bunch of that promise for restoration and the stuff about the Messiah. Achievement unlocked. We got Jeremiah and tomorrow we'll try and tackle lamentations. All right. And Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Lamentations. My friends, Lamentations is brutal. It's not a fun, enjoyable romp. It's not something that gives you a bunch of optimism and hope. It is exactly what the name promises. It is a deep dive into the deepest pits of human grief. It's a tough read. Even 2,500 years removed, you can sense that the pain that is being written about and experienced by whoever wrote this was probably Jeremiah, but we don't know for sure. The book is technically anonymous. That pain is unprecedented for them. This is unprecedented for anybody. There's no cultural memory of the kind of pain that is being collectively felt as the circumstances that prompt the writing of this book. It's disorienting. Everything about the world is flipped on its head and then smashed with a hammer. It feels like hope and morality and everything that you would use to orient yourself in time and space and meaning and culture and language and faith. And God, all of it is wrecked in one fell swoop in one horrible calamity. The calamity that we're talking about, if you've been with me through this series, it keeps coming up because the Bible keeps talking about it because indeed it's a gigantic catastrophe. It's the conquest of the southern kingdom of Judah and its capital city Jerusalem at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian. It's kind of a wild way to express this kind of withering disorienting grief because instead of just listing out a bunch of grievances or having a bunch of intellectual debates like what we get when we see Job dealing with grief. Instead, we just get five poems here, five poems. They each tackle a different aspect of this grief and each poem covers one of the five chapters of Lamentations. If this was written by Jeremiah, it's a pretty bitter pill for him. If you're Jeremiah, think about your life. You not only had to write down that this is what was coming, but everybody hated you for writing it down. You experienced physical persecution. You were on the run because you said these things God wanted you to say. Then it happens. So you're in the city watching the Babylonians roll up on the city. You're in the city for the miserable siege, which includes details like parents eating their kids. I told you it was dark. So you live through that. You see the bloodshed. You see what happens finally in any siege. This one would be the same I imagine when the walls finally break and the pent up anger and frustration and lust for blood and vengeance and indulgence that would happen on the part of the people who've been stuck outside those walls as you stubbornly hold out in there is that stuff all finally is let loose upon what's left of your weakened city when the walls break that moment across all of history when the walls finally get broken down in a siege is historically perhaps the worst moment of human behavior across the centuries. People revert to something terribly, terribly frighteningly zombie like and primal in that moment. And if you're Jeremiah, you were on the receiving end. But if you're Jeremiah, you're not just watching that happen to any random city and thinking, Oh, people can be really bad. You're watching that happen to your people. You're watching that happen to your city. You're watching that happen to the temple where God lives who told you to say this stuff in the first place. Then when that initial brutal wave of terror is over now, if you're Jeremiah, you get to look at the city that was once resplendent and now it's just empty. It's wrecked. It's ruined. You're never going to see this thing put back together, at least in your lifetime. My point is there's something to lament here and it's not a normal lamentation. I'm not trying to make light of the things that have broken your heart, my friends. I don't want to make light of the things that have broken my heart. My heart hurts about stuff deeply. I have known loss, painful loss. I'm going to know more. It kills me to know that I'm going to know more loss, but this is life. I know you've hurt. I know you've victimized and have regret. I know you've been victimized and feel all kinds of hurt over that. As much as I think we have collegiality with Jeremiah in our grief, I also think we need to acknowledge that this is a unique grief that goes beyond one lifetime. This is a grief of the loss of an era in epoch 500 years. This kingdom in the city is stood. Boom. Gone. That there's been a tabernacle or a temple where God dwells with these people and the priests carry out the sacrifices and the relationship between God and man, the weird at times and busted up at times. It persisted through all of this. That is over the line of David to whom God is promised. This great king bears the title of Redeemer who's supposed to come. Now, the line of David is gone. The streets are empty. It's ruined. It looks like everything is wrecked. Everything in the short term, near term about your life, what you know. But also there's this broader cultural grief that extends all the way out even to the question of is the whole redemptive plan of God even going to come through. And Jeremiah feels every single level of that. If it wasn't Jeremiah personally who put pen to paper to write these poems, then whoever is writing these poems had access to everything that Jeremiah wrote and he can easily see it through Jeremiah's lenses. Either way, that pain is communicated this early in each of these chapters. In the first one, we get this scene of a woman in grief. The woman is a metaphor, almost for grief. And the images are haunting just of Jerusalem after the siege, wrecked, gone. Everything's emptied out. There was a gigantic scare that affected kind of everybody not too long ago. And this really cool town near where I live called Deadwood that was always hustling and bustling, just completely emptied out. I've got video of my phone driving through that town, not a soul in sight. And they're just deer that are walking up and down the road looking for little scraps to eat. It looked like something out of a zombie apocalypse show. And I go back and I think of that moment and of that video often because it jarred me to think about really how temporal, how fragile all these things that seem like they're never going anywhere actually are. That's the tone of what's captured in the first chapter of Jeremiah. In the second chapter, the author seems to be saying, look, there were terms to this deal. I'm your God, you're my people and everybody's going to know it whether you obey me or not, because if you obey me, I'm going to bless you. And if you disobey me, I'm going to punish you. You know, the author acknowledges you were right to do this. We were wrong, but also I still hate it. Paraphrases mine, but the author never even for a second indicates that like, Oh, I should probably feel bad. I'm sorry. Like I want to like the judgment that you brought upon us. I really should know the author seems to assume that it's absolutely fine for him to hate it, to hate the way this feels, to be absolutely bereaved, even justified in articulating his grief and disorientation, even anger, if you will, over what has happened. Chapter three is the centerpiece of the whole book, though. Here you get another invented literary character who is created to say that he's heartbroken, that he's crushed, that this is indeed righteous judgment from God. But there's an interesting twist in the middle here where the poet seems to be saying, well, if God did exactly what he said he was going to do in punishing us for violating his covenant, then he'll probably also do exactly what he said he was going to do, even if I can't picture how in delivering and still redeeming again, even though the pathway for that doesn't seem obvious to me as the poet anymore. And in the midst of chapter three, we get a verse that if you're familiar with the Bible, you've been around church for a while, you've probably heard before. If not, this is a really neat one. I'm excited to read it to you. But it's a verse that I think a lot of people would forget is in the middle of lamentations as chapter three starting in verse 22, the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end. They're new every morning, great as your faithfulness. Theoretically, that doesn't make sense in the middle of the subject matter that we're dealing with in the horrors that we've already seen described and that we're going to see described more in chapter four here in a second. But this is the centerpiece of the book, the God who was consistent enough to carry out this righteous, if very, very painful judgment will also be consistent enough to follow through on his promise to redeem one way or another. In chapter four, we get a poem about the contrast between how beautiful things were before and how horrible things were during and after the siege, how everything gets flipped on its head for the worse. And then in the final poem in chapter five, everyone is begging for God to stop to relent, to remember his people, to restore what's been destroyed, what's been judged. And then it ends with no resolution whatsoever. And that's it. There's no pat on the head. There's no little glimmer of hope like we get at the end of some other books. The only hopeful thing we see in the whole book is that little bit that I was giving you there in the middle of chapter three, where the poet considers the character of God. Nowhere in the book, does anybody apologize for being sad or being upset? Rather what we're seeing here is the depths of human despair and grief and an earnest processing in this case of a calamity that was entirely predictable and entirely makes sense to the author. This isn't like Job where it's like, why did this happen? What's going on? I don't understand. And here everybody knows exactly why this went wrong. And we get a great look at a deeply honest human response to that pain mingled with some top notch theology about the character of God, even against the backdrop of that pain. When you visualize lamentations, picture somebody in the dirt of the ruined city of Jerusalem with the ruined temple in the background as they cry out to God. When you consider the theme, think of grief in the context of God. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least read chapter three.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Ezekiel. So it's been a while since I worked through the book of Ezekiel, and I have an opening observation after having gone through it carefully and in anticipation of our conversation here. And that is, wow! Let me try it again. Dang! Alright, one more time. What the heck? It's so intense. I forgot how much the book of Ezekiel is characterized by this sustained look at God's anger at a level and for an amount of time, screen time, that I don't think we see anywhere else in the Bible. This is God unloading on what's left of his chosen people as they are about to be taken away into captivity and utterly defeated and ruined by the Babylonians. And then even more piling on happens after they get taken away into captivity. But like everything else we've seen where God's wrath and judgment comes out, there is also hope and there's also a promise of redemption. But the mechanics of that work a little bit differently here. Back to my original point though, the intensity here is massive. So much so that I felt as I read this kind of like I feel when my friends who have kids start scolding their kids and getting after them and like I had nothing to do with what their four year old did wrong, getting their fruit roll up hands all over somebody's class or whatever. Like whatever. Maybe the kid needed to be corrected or scolded. Maybe they're breaking rules. But when they start yelling at their kid, I'm like, I feel guilty. I feel bad. I feel awkward. I feel like I've done something wrong by proxy. And that is how I feel going through this. I'm not from Israel. I was born 2500 2600 years after the events described here. I got problems, but it's kind of a different list of problems than what they have. But there is so much judgment from God as I listened to him scold his children, his chosen people that I can't help but hunch my shoulders as I read it. I think that's probably the best way to read it. I think it's good to get worn down by the tone of Ezekiel and get to a place where you're like, all right, well, yeah, I'm not perfect either. And I suppose if there was a book like this about the things that I got wrong, I wouldn't really like it if everybody got to read that for a few thousand years after the fact. So I'm just going to take this correction by proxy as well and try to see what I'm supposed to take from this book. So that begs the question, what are we supposed to take from Ezekiel and what's really going on here? How do we sift through all of this given the very bizarre imagery that we get throughout the book of Ezekiel? I'm going to do my best to break this thing down. First of all, let's talk about the guy who wrote it. It's pretty clear that this has a ton of autobiographical details and actually unlike many of the prophets of the Old Testament where we have a sense of when they're writing with Ezekiel because of the time markers he gives us historically. We can say like, I was probably like April 11th this year, he was sitting there writing this thing, maybe not quite that precise, but really close. We have a clear, clear timeline on when Ezekiel is writing all of this stuff down and that's helpful because then we can compare it with what was going on politically in these other parts of the ancient world who are being prophesied about. So Ezekiel is a dude who we meet in Babylon, not in Israel. He's a very young man and in the opening scene of the book of Ezekiel, he is sitting on the banks of the rivers thinking about life and probably feeling pretty sad about the fact that he is in exile, but he's a member of a group of early exiles that you and I haven't talked about very much in our conversation here. But at the end of Second Kings, at the end of Second Chronicles, when the conquest happens of the Southern Kingdom, an Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon comes in and conquers everybody and destroys the temple and takes them away into captivity in Babylon, that actually happened in two waves and the first waves happened very early in the sixth century, probably 597 BC when a bunch of cultural elites and significant characters, but a small minority of residents of Jerusalem got taken away into captivity along with their young king. It was kind of a shot across the bow from Nebuchadnezzar to be like, get your act together or there's going to be a lot more where this came from. Now, poor Ezekiel gets swept up in that relocation program of Nebuchadnezzar. So again, the book of Ezekiel opens Ezekiel sitting there on the banks of rivers somewhere in Babylon and who should show up? But God, I'm not kidding. Not like through the words of a prophet, no, straight up the glory of God shows up in a way that we've sort of seen already in the Bible, but in a way that's also kind of new and more Ezekiel sees this heavenly chariot, this heavenly litter. If you, you know, litter, that's like the thing that the servants carry around on their shoulders, back in the ancient world and then people would ride in there and get fanned and fed grapes and stuff like that. It looks like that's what Ezekiel's describing except the four corners of this litter that God is riding on or being carried by angels who do not look like the adorable depictions of precious moments, figurines. They look weird and terrifying. They got a bunch of eyes and wings and weird heads and they're all like hovering over wheels. So it looks like something out of science fiction and deep cut fantasy imagery and understandably Ezekiel doesn't know what to do. He knows God when he's looking at God and the glory of God is there. And again, I told you the imagery is odd. He ends up eating a scroll of the words of the wisdom of the truth of God and being commissioned under the title Son of Man to go and say and do things that God wants to communicate to a whole slew of different people. And so is Ezekiel. What choices he have, he goes and does that. And what we've got now is Jeremiah who we've talked about a lot over the last couple of days, he's clear back in Jerusalem. He didn't get taken with the first wave of exiles, but he predicted that was all coming way in advance. And then you'll recall in the book of Jeremiah, he sees that horrible catastrophe, that horrible calamity befall Jerusalem and everybody get taken away. So Jeremiah is over there hearing from God as well at the same time that God is also in Babylon where Ezekiel is hearing from God. The message seems to be more or less the same and that God is very unhappy and that this is a right and just judgment against their behavior. And nobody can argue that God is being just and doing exactly what he said he would do by judging his own people. So Jeremiah, lamentations Ezekiel, we're all on the same page. God is just to bring about this judgment even if it is horrible. But Jeremiah is trying to prepare the people who aren't yet in exile to go and do what they're supposed to do and play the role they're supposed to play while in exile, which is still coming. Meanwhile, Ezekiel is being commissioned to talk to presumably primarily the people who are in exile with him, these early exiles before the big batch of exiles gets hauled away by Nebuchadnezzar a few years later in 586 BC. But weirdly in the meantime, God tells Ezekiel to do weird acts of public protest. And honestly, I don't know what to make of this or how to feel about it emotionally because it looks like some of the really ridiculous theatrical over the top kind of protests that we see going on even today as I'm recording this all around the world over various issues. But God commissions Ezekiel commands Ezekiel to go do performance art and the performance art is bizarre. He's supposed to make little props and like puppets and act out scenes of what's going to happen. And he's supposed to do this thing where he goes and lays down in public for this massively long period of time. All bound up is like a symbol of what's going to happen to the rest of God's chosen people. And he has to eat food over a fire of burning poop. And I think at first, I think I'm getting this detail, right? I think at first God's deal is like it's going to be human poop. And then Ezekiel's like, what if it was like animal poop? And God is like, okay, we'll go with animal poop. But the worst thing about all of this performative prophecy that Ezekiel has to act out is that God makes it really clear like none of it's going to work at all. I'm just basically what God is doing is he setting up his case to be like, let no one say that my name is Sullied by the way this went down. I sent notice, I sent more notice, I sent prophets, I communicated what I was doing. And you all ignored all of it. That's very central to the message of Ezekiel, which then pivots to imagery throughout the book that effectively is saying God's not in the temple anymore. The spirit of God is going to leave that temple and it's not going to be dwelling among the people in that place anymore, which is obviously calamitous. It's catastrophic. What does this mean for the redemptive plan? But then about the time that you're trying to let that stuff sink in, we just get smashed with tens of chapters of God reeling off condemnation for his own people, for neighboring people, groups about all the stuff they got wrong. And the punchline of each of these judgments and each of these calamities that God is predicting through his mouthpiece Ezekiel is that when it's all done, then they will know that I am God. They will know that I am the Lord. I listen to this audible version of the Bible and I read it in the text as well. But the audible version I'm doing is a British actor named David Soushey. He played her Qelpero and other legendary characters. He's got a fantastic voice and his reading throughout the Bible has this very chill God voice and whenever it is God is right up on the microphone and speaks like this and it's chilling even when God is happy, it invokes reverence. This guy did an amazing job on his reading of the Bible. But in this one, his angry God voice and his then they will know that I am the Lord is just it's intense. And again, you feel that vicarious correction, even though it's addressed to the entire Egypt or whomever. It feels like he is talking to you and fairness. I felt the same way just reading it with my eyes as well. But in the midst of all of this, there is this little nugget, this little hint about how God is going to create a new heart out of this hardened heart of his people. And it kind of sounds like the famous verse in the New Testament, 2 Corinthians 5 17. Therefore, if anyone's in Christ, he's a new creation. The old is gone and the new is come. And so it's at that point at about the 25% mark in this book that we start being like, okay, there's a lot of judgment happening here. But it almost feels like we're getting a new paradigm that's being rolled out. Like there's a new deal being vaguely anticipated and hinted at between God and maybe not even just his chosen people, maybe between God and people period, because these judgments as we go through the rest of Ezekiel are different than the other stuff we've seen in other books. This feels final. Like you blew it. This is my judgment. You are dead, straight up dead. But then as bad as that sounds as we get into the second half of the book, almost in keeping with the way Abraham negotiated with God a little bit for a lot and for Sodom and Gomorrah, the way Moses seemed to negotiate with God a little bit, like God, for the sake of your own name, we don't leave us all out into the desert to die. You got to deliver us into this land. Well, the nations think and we kind of see that same line of thinking here as God spells it out very clearly in chapter 36 that he is still going to bring about redemption. There is still going to be a Messiah. All of the things he said he was going to do, he's still going to do, but he makes it clear that he's not going to do it for the sake of Israel because they somehow earned it or held up their end of the bargain. He's going to do it for the sake of his own name. And to illustrate how God is going to take that absolutely dead, broken stone heart of his people and make it alive again in a way that is new for his glory. He takes Ezekiel out to this valley where everybody's dead. There's a bunch of bones laying around like in the Lion King where the hyenas are or something. And then God brings the bones back to life and they reassemble back together and flesh comes upon them and all of a sudden there's a new people, a living, thriving people where there was only dust and death and absolutely total hopelessness. There was nothing those dead, rickety bones were going to do to put themselves back together. But God decides there will be life here. There will be a people where there were not a people lest we would worry that they would suffer the same faith that they suffered last time around like, oh, you just get trampled on by the evil of other nations and your own hearts will turn to stone. No, no, no, we get a reiteration from God that he's going to create a new heart in people that is soft and that is different and that somehow is a part of a new relationship from this life-giving temple that will pour out its waters that flow out of this temple. It's not even clear if this is an actual literal temple or what, but this water will flow out into the desert and bring life to this dry, dead land. And it's almost like we're talking about a return to Eden and we learn that it's a return to Eden that is unassailable because this evil, Kingly character and his seven nation army. That's where that reference comes from, by the way, they come against God, but God crushes them three different ways. And it's like, no, the evil forces are not going to prevail against this new family, this new people that I am making and their own heart. Hearts are not going to prevail against them. God is going to redeem fending off evil from within and without. And there's going to be some kind of new relationship between God and his people that looks like the one that used to exist in the garden, but that got wrecked. Ezekiel then seems really intimidating when you read through it the first time because that judgment language stands out so starkly. But upon closer review, what we actually see here is not a glimmer of hope. We see a mountain of hope. We see a whole new pathway, a roadmap forward for how this seemingly broken plan is actually alive and well and how God's sovereignty over this redemptive plan has never even been remotely threatened by the bad behavior of his chosen people. But for the sake of his glory, he's going to see it through. And now we have a clearer picture of exactly what that's going to look like when you visualize Ezekiel, there's a lot of things you could picture. But let's just have you picture that valley of dry bones and people coming back to life with new soft hearts. When you think about the central theme, think about the fact that God has decided he is still going to redeem not for the sake of his rebellious people, but for the sake of his own name. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go check out chapter 36. I know it took a little more time to get through the book of Ezekiel here, but it's hugely important underappreciated pivot point between all of the problems being set up in the Old Testament and moving toward anticipating the solutions that we see in Jesus in the New Testament. So thanks for gaming it out with me. Congratulations to both of us on leveling up our collective Ezekiel game. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Daniel. I'm telling you, my friends, Daniel is so dang good, then it's a trap right there in the middle of the Bible, because let's say you're making a podcast and you're trying to have a bunch of conversations about the Bible and you got to do one every day. You don't have a ton of time to linger on each book and read it and read it again and read it again. But Daniel is so interesting and it has such big implications and the narrative is so good that it's really hard to hustle past it. Maybe I want to open here with a sales pitch for why I think it's so interesting and so cool. It defies categorization, it's half narrative and it's half prophecy and the two mingle together in interesting ways. The basically the first half is the narrative stuff and the second half is the prophecy stuff. As if that weren't enough, half of it's not written in Hebrew. The rest of everything we've looked at almost entirely is in Hebrew, but Daniel only has chapter one being in Hebrew and then chapters eight through 12 being in Hebrew. But in the middle, there's a giant chunk of Aramaic, which by the time we get to Jesus, that was the language that the Jews were speaking, walking around in those scenes in the New Testament. But back here, Aramaic hadn't totally caught on everywhere yet. In fact, it was during the life of Daniel that Aramaic went from being a language that saw some use because lots of different people could use it even fumblingly to communicate under the larger banner of the Babylonian Empire. But then when Persia comes along, Aramaic becomes a court language, an administrative language used throughout the entire Persian Empire. And so it makes sense that we would get a chunk in Aramaic, but still it's kind of jarring to suddenly encounter this big chunk of the Hebrew Bible that isn't in Hebrew in the book of Daniel. The third reason that Daniel is super, super interesting and compelling is that the prophecy is wildly big picture. It has similar visuals and imagery to Ezekiel. Maybe that's just a function of God drawing on imagery that would have made more sense in a Babylonian context. I have no idea those two books though. They definitely stand out just in terms of the visions they describe and what stuff looks like. But whereas Ezekiel's prophecies are focused on God's judgment on the nations right there and then in that moment of history, Daniel is talking about the ebb and flow and churn of history as one empire collides with another and is defeated and rises and falls and it looks far, far, forward into history. And that takes us into a whole new realm of conversation and reflection as pilgrims, as journeyers through the Old Testament together. More on that in just a minute. The book of Daniel opens a lot like Ezekiel opens where you've got a Jewish young man who finds himself in captivity in Babylon. But Daniel and Ezekiel did not get there quite the same way. Daniel was a part of the very, very, very, very first teeny, tiny little group of people from Judah to be taken away into captivity. This wasn't even really an exile. It was more of a hostage exchange where the Babylonians and Nebuchadnezzar get some hostages and the king of Judah gets no hostages. Judah at this point in the very, very late 600s had been kind of hiding behind the other superpower of the ancient world that being Egypt. And now at this point, Nebuchadnezzar, this happens in 2 Kings 24, the very beginning of 2 Kings 24. Nebuchadnezzar is like I've had enough of Egypt and so they go and they have a big fight and Nebuchadnezzar wins the battle of Karkamesh and then now that he's feeling it and Egypt has been brought to its knees. He's like, all right, Judah, no more messing around. You're going to owe me tribute and also I'm going to take a few of your young men back home with me just to ensure you're good behavior. Daniel, as well as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego of fiery furnace fame are some of those hostages. Well, it looks like they all get treated pretty well there and they live life well and they earn favor in the royal court. This in and of itself in a hostage exchange situation between an overlord and a subject kingdom would not be weird because the overlord would want to bring talented promising young men as hostages and would want to ingratiate themselves to these young men as a lever of control over the subject state back off on the far distant horizons of places. And so the fact that they did well isn't that surprising. What's surprising is that they did well without becoming Babylonian. They wouldn't bend the knee to Babylonian habits. And in chapter one, we see that Daniel and his three friends are like, yeah, we're just not going to take your food and your drink and your luxury. We don't feel right about it. We're not going to do it. And you can test to see if God will preserve us even without all your fancy food and God does and they rise to greater levels of prominence. So that's chapter one, then we get into the Aramaic section in chapters two through seven. And what we get here are, I don't want to cheapen it by saying adventures, but when you read it through the first time, it's adventures. It's grand exploits with high stakes again and again. And what you get is two sets of three adventures that are all connected with each other. So the adventures in chapters two and seven are a pair of dreams. The one in chapter two is a dream that Nebuchadnezzar has. The one in chapter seven is a dream that Daniel has. Daniel gets summoned to interpret the dream of Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar didn't tell them what the dream is. And Daniel's like, yeah, I know what you dreamed. He describes this statue with various layers of building material from toes up to head that are used to build the statue. And clearly it anticipates the churn of nations and empires that is to come in the ensuing centuries. And ultimately it looks like Daniel in interpreting this dream anticipates Rome and anticipates the arrival of the Messiah. Now really starting with Isaiah and a few key passages, but then really picking up steam in Jeremiah and really picking up steam in Ezekiel and Daniel, we keep seeing more specificity about what the Messiah is going to be like and what's going to happen. And indeed we get that here in a crucial passage in Daniel's interpretation of this dream in verse 44 of Daniel chapter two, and I'm going to straight up read it to you. He's saying this to Nebuchadnezzar in the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms, the ones depicted in the various building materials in the parts of this statue in the mechanism stream that parts that will aside his mind and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. Okay. We came on, we're doing the redemptive plan and this prophecy just further affirms that. Now Daniel's dream in chapter seven takes us to a whole other level as it employs imagery that anticipates the Persian conquest and then the arrival probably of Alexander the Great. That's sure what it looks like. The description, I mean, go read it for yourself really looks like Alexander the Great. And then it's okay if you don't remember all of your Western sieve history, but Alexander the Great conquers all of Persia in the three hundreds. And then he dies at a young age, the age of 33 in Babylon without appointing an heir. And so his generals just carve up the kingdom and have many empires scattered about Alexander's world. And one of those proves to be a huge thorn in the side of the Jews down the road. And eventually the Maccabean revolt in the second century is the overthrow of that military quote, unquote descendant of Alexander and the Macedonians or the Greeks. And it looks like all of that is anticipated in the prophecy in the second half of the book of Daniel starting in chapter seven with Daniel's dream. So we get those matching adventures in two and seven. And then we get the two beloved stories that are matching adventures in chapters three and six, that being Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the fiery furnace and Daniel in the lions den in both cases, these heroes of the story are like, yeah, we're just not going to bend the knee to your false gods. The king is no God at all. There's only one king and his kingdom is going to go on forever. And so no, we just can't play along with this thing. And they receive an edict of death in the case of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. That's from Babylon in the case of Daniel in the lions den. That sentence of death is from Persia. So it seems that not matter what empire we're talking about, they're all threatened by the real king and the real God. And also they both fail in their attempt to execute these guys for declaring that God is the true king and that his victory will happen. Then we get a pair of adventures that are hitched together in chapters four and five, one where Nebuchadnezzar loses his mind and is made to behave like an animal before he finally in his own words, repents and acknowledges the true God of heaven. And then in chapter five, we get the famous scene of Bel Shazar's banquet with the hand writing on the wall, words of judgment. Daniel again is summoned to interpret something that nobody else can figure out. And he's like, yeah, tough luck. You've been weighed and found wanting and this very night your kingdom is going to be taken from you. And it's going to go to Persia. And then it does. That happens that very night. But then in the second half of the book, which I'm just going to cover very, very quickly because I don't have the time or capacity to properly break down the complexity of all of the prophecy that happens there. In the second half of the book, you get a bunch of very big picture prophecy. One of the real downers in the middle of all of that happens in chapter nine when Daniel's looking at Jeremiah's prophecy about like, okay, we're supposed to be an exile for about this much time. We should be about done actually. And then an angel shows up and is like, no, so about that actually that is referring to a period of time that is going to go on even longer. And of course, Daniel's got to be like, no, no, no, no, no, but those timeline prophecies that we get in the second half of Daniel coupled with the prophecies that deal with the rise and fall and clashing of empires. All of that adds up to something that has captured the imagination and attention of Bible readers and interpreters forever trying to figure out how exactly the timeline works. What nations have to rise and fall? How do you count the number of years? Can you even count the number of years between rises and falls and the arrival of the Messiah and whatever happens after the arrival of the Messiah? And then Jesus himself references back to some of this material when he's giving a discourse about what's going to happen in the end of time toward the end of the book of Matthew. And so there's just a ton here to wrestle with. And a lot of people through the centuries have wrestled with it and said, this is meant to be decoded and we can figure out the pace at which history is going to unfold. And the moment at which the kingdom stuff is ultimately going to happen and all the nations will be defeated and everybody will acknowledge God is king and the kingdom will be established and visualized. I do not share that same optimism. I find myself more in collegiality with the people who look at it and they're like, this prophecy applies on like five different levels and the math on how it all unfolds is simply too complex to calculate on the front end. But it'll all look very, very clear on the back end as this unfolding of history occurs. What is crystal clear though coming out of Daniel, both from the narrative chunk and from the prophetic chunk is that God is the master of history and that the role of the person who is a servant of God is not necessarily to solve all of history and to figure out everything that's going to happen. But it's to be faithful in the interim as God unfolds history at the pace he's going to unfold it, but also anticipatory noting with hope and anticipation as these things unfold and do gradually over time come into focus. And just as a side note, I think the historical setting of Daniel is absolutely genius for communicating this point because you've got a massive churn going on here historically for the people of Judah. This is their grand calamity. It's an overhaul of their entire paradigm. Everything changes for them for Babylon. We see the apex of their civilization, but also their absolute defeat contained within the pages of Daniel and then we see the rise of Persia, but also anticipated after the rise of the greatest empire in history up to this point Persia. We anticipate their defeat at the hands of Alexander the great, but also we anticipate the defeat of Alexander the great by death and lack of planning, but then also we anticipate the defeat of his generals and their smaller empires and also we anticipate the rise of Rome and some sort of toppling of Rome all here on screen. Historically, there's not really a better moment in history up until this point that could have been chosen to undergird this grand message of Daniel, which is that God is sovereign over history and these kings might seem like the truest, realist thing, but they're not. There's a king who is greater. There's a kingdom who is greater. And even if you can't see it the same way you see these rising and falling empires right now, you will see it one day because God will bring these things to pass when you visualize the book of Daniel picture, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in a furnace, not burning right next to Daniel in Alliance, then not being eaten well in the background, a giant statue that is a monument to the glorious power of governments and the state and kings and empires gradually crumbles to the ground. If you visualize that, you won't have any trouble remembering the theme of the book of Daniel. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, try to catch chapters one and six and make sure to go read chapter two verse 44 that I mentioned earlier for yourself. I got to say, as we wrap up Daniel, the anticipation for God's redemptive plan, flourishing and moving forward is really building. And I think it's very exciting. All right. I appreciate you.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Hosea. All my goodness! Poor, poor, poor Hosea. I mean, not poor on the one hand. The guy got to interact with the God who made all things, and he's held out as having this massive prophetic career, which is a great honor, but much like the other prophets who we get some biographical data about here in the prophetic section of the Old Testament, being a prophet was a really rough draw in terms of personal comfort and basic human happiness. You're pitted against all your fellow countrymen. Your job is to be commissioned by God to say this whole thing is going off of a cliff. Nobody likes hearing that, and there's going to be a whole lot of suffering. We see how much Jeremiah's suffered. We see now costly. The execution of his prophetic duties was for Ezekiel, but maybe nobody gets a raw deal than Hosea in the worldly sense at least because God commissions him to do something very, very personal and very difficult with his life as sort of again that performance art style prophecy. We saw that in Ezekiel, you'll recall as well, where God had Ezekiel go and do really strange things and publicly, lie on the ground and bind yourself up and you got to eat food, roast it over poop and things like that. Well, Ezekiel is not the only prophet who God commissions to do this visual aid performance art style prophecy to make his point. The book of Hosea opens by giving us a time frame for when everything is going on. This is more or less all the background information we get on the guy at all. Looks like he was working in roughly the middle of the 700s BC up till roughly the end of the 700s BC. And in that time, which is dominated by the long shadow of the wicked, horrible king, Jeroboam II, Hosea is speaking to the Northern Kingdom while they are in a phase where they're really into Canaanite culture and style and fashion and worship and abominations. But they're also really into trying to buddy up to the big superpowers of the day where everything is so cosmopolitan and cool, not backwards like it is here. Hosea is right into people who just love Assyria. I mean, they're a little afraid of Assyria too, but Syria, that's where awesome stuff happens. And sure, we can never be Assyria, but we could like be their wingman. And they could protect us from other threats. Now, as we read through Hosea, we figure out like they still do sacrifices and stuff or whatever, like on their way to worship the Canaanite gods or on their way to engage in horrible practices that are popular amongst the much more fashionable Assyrians to the North. So like, they're still like, you know, go to church and stuff, but it's a fraud. And so how popular is Hosea going to be for coming along and being like, hey, it's a fraud and your weird gross romance with Assyria and even Egypt is going to backfire on you and Assyria is ultimately going to destroy you and take you away into captivity. That's a pretty rough draw for Hosea. And then after we get past the historical context and setting and all of that business, then we get into the part where it gets personal and God specifically says to Hosea, go take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the Lord. Obviously, I'm sure that's disappointing for him. You never want to have God show up and tell you to marry a prostitute if you can help it at least. But despite any understandable misgivings he might have, Hosea goes and does what God told him to do. We marries this woman named Gomer and there is a reason that's not a Bible name that you see a lot of little girls run around with these days because even though it's not clear whether or not she was into prostitution at the time they got married, it's very clear from the text that she was very into the prostitution thing after they got married. Well, Gomer and Hosea air quotes here have three kids together. Maybe they're all Hoseas. I think you can make a case from the raw material of the text that one or more might be from these other relationships. But Hosea treats them like his kids and in keeping with this performance art prophecy approach that God is commanding him to take, he gives the kids really rough names that point backwards toward the atrocities of the current dynasty of kings in the northern kingdom of Israel that also look forward in anticipation of God's judgment and justice for that that'll come in 722 when the Assyrians come in and conquer the northern kingdom. And then the names also point to God's disappointment with his people disappointment. That's a grand understatement. But I think you get what I mean and God's impulse to even consider putting them away divorcing his own people. So then on top of these kids being born and having these names, Gomer then adds insult to injury by going and as some people view it, selling herself voluntarily into some kind of prostitution or slavery to somebody else. Other people read it as she just left Hosea for so long and was with someone else that she was no longer regarded culturally as his wife. Either way, if he wants her back, he's going to have to take his own name, his own resources, his own reputation and go do something about this. I know this situation sounds insane and ridiculous and even cruel to put somebody through it make of that what you will. But it sets up the big grand question of Hosea and indeed the big grand question kind of of the whole Old Testament relationship between God and his chosen people. And the question goes like this, should Hosea and should God just let their bride who voluntarily sold themselves into the darkest, most debasing, shameful type of slavery should they just let them go? Or should God and Hosea with their own resources, their own reputation go and buy back their bride from their own self-inflicted debased slavery as we work through the book. We discovered that there's this gross imbalance in the relationship that Israel has with these foreign superpowers and that Gomer has with these other men. They chase after them and admire them and love them and throw themselves at these other outside things, but these outside things, Syria, these other men, they don't seem to love Gomer. They don't seem to love Israel back. Certainly, a Syria doesn't for all of the admiration of a Syria and cowtowing to a Syria. It's not too long and they're going to come down and wipe out Israel altogether. But in contrast, we see God who is right to be irritated. Hosea, who is right to be irritated, even right to ponder washing their hands of the whole thing. They don't do it because they're actually committed to this love. So in chapter two, we get a poem that spells all of this stuff out that recounts some of the ugliness of Israel along the way. And then we start to get some answers at the beginning of chapter three that points to how God is going to respond to this metaphorical adulterous situation that's going on with his people who he loves. We get that through this performance art prophecy in the life of Hosea. Here's what happens. Hosea three one, the Lord said to me, go show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and isn't adulterous. Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes. And then in one of the most plainly understated statements of beauty and profundity in the entire Bible, Hosea just casually says, so I bought her for 15 shekels of silver and about a Homer and lethic of barley, dude when used his meager resources to buy his wife back out of trafficking and slavery that she voluntarily signed up for. And he didn't have enough to get it done with just coins. He had the equivalent of about five silver coins, which just as a point of reference, sounds like this one. That's it. That's what he was able to muster to buy her back and he had to pay the rest with barley. Well, the rest of Hosea plays out this whole situation over the course of several different movements and poems. And the simple version of all of that is this. God is very unhappy with the behavior of his people. There is judgment coming for his people, but the question of will he divorce them is answered the same way. The question of will, Hosea divorce, Gomer is answered. No, he's not going to and we get these beautiful passages, particularly in chapter 11 where you get these overtones of the prodigal son as God talks about his love for Jacob for Ephraim and how he was there when Ephraim took his first steps and he's a dad toward this kid and he can't help but have his heart soft. And then also we've obviously got the metaphor throughout the book that's more of the husband and wife, but these are two of the most intimate relationships and anybody can imagine where you just can't help but love the other person. And God draws on both of these and in this beautiful anticipation of the prodigal son message in Luke 15 that we get from Jesus, God spells out the reality that he's not just using the people of Israel for performance art himself. They aren't just pawns that he doesn't actually care about, but he's just acting out his power and redemptive plan on. He actually loves them. And I don't understand enough about the nature of an infinite being to know if you can hurt him in the way that you can hurt another person, but at the very least he's taking on human categories of emotion and relationships to communicate that in a way that humans can understand and that this is hurtful. I love you and this is hurtful and those other people you're running after, those other things you're running after, they don't love you. They will not forgive you. They will not be patient with you. They will not chasten you. They're using you. And then in chapter 14 in the midst of more difficult language, we look forward to something that is echoed in Matthew 13 and Jesus parable about the little mustard seed and the great tree that grows up and all the birds and creatures take shelter in it. There's that same kind of language there about the plans that God still has for his chosen people and what is going to be built up out of this mess of a relationship that they have made. And in the conclusion of the book in chapter 14, we get the payoff with what was hinted in all the imagery throughout that God is going to judge, but he's also going to restore. He's still in on the redemptive plan. He still loves his people. And chapter 14 is pretty cool because there are several details that indicate that, hey, this isn't just about Israel and one political moment with the northern kingdom locked in time back in the eighth century. There's something very transcendent here in the final verse of the whole thing is who is wise? He will realize these things. Who is discerning? He'll understand them. The ways of the Lord are right. The righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them. In other words, what's being said is no matter where you are and no matter what time the things of God, the reality of his character and the redemptive work that he's doing, these things are unchanging and the same. But some in any given age are going to encounter those things and it'll be a foundation. It'll be life giving. It'll be a source of strength and orientation. Others will crash against it. And we see Jesus employing this language in the New Testament as well. I don't want to take your brain to too dark of a place, but when you visualize Hosea picture this poor impoverished man with the last coins he has to his name, walking into a brothel and buying his own wife back from the degenerate who has taken ownership of her. When you're considering the theme of Hosea, reflect on God's faithfulness, even when his people who he loves are not faithful. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, get chapter one, get the first few verses of chapter three, maybe in the middle of that, catch chapter two versus 19 through 20 and make sure you catch the remarks about Ephraim and God's tender heart toward his people in chapter 11 versus one through 12. All right, my friends, achievement unlocked. That's Hosea for both of us. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Joel. I'm looking at something right now, right here in front of me, that is very troubling, disturbing even given the conversation we are having. I'm going to keep eyes on that while we talk, and I will tell you more about that in a minute. We're talking about the book of Joel this time around, which is kind of an outlier in terms of what we're seeing pattern wise with all of these Old Testament prophetic books. One, it's very, very short. It's only three chapters long. You can read it probably faster than you can listen to this conversation that we're about to have. Two, we don't really know anything about the guy who wrote it other than what his dad's name is. Three, there's nothing to orient by in terms of where we fit historically here. You know how in all the other prophetic books we've looked at so far, we get some kind of thing about like in the fifth year of King such and such, of the land of such and such, the word of the Lord came to this prophet guy. So you know what's going on politically in the background, and it makes it a lot easier to read through those prophets and be like, ah, that's an image for this. And that's a reference to that. And oh, that's fulfilled over here. Well in Joel, we don't really get that. It's more open ended in terms of where it fits historically. And it's also more open ended in terms of when the things it predicts are going to happen. Look, there's no two ways about it. When we get to the end of this discussion here, and I say the part about like, hey, when you visualize Joel picture this, it's going to be. Locusts, because locusts and particularly a locust swarm is the key image in the book of Joel. And then in chapter one, we get a locust swarm that looks like it's an actual description of an actual literal locust swarm that came and crashed onto presumably Jerusalem and Judah in a literal sense and just torched everything. I mean, ate everything down to the bone down to just leave in white sticks where there used to be fertile plants and everything is wrecked and it even puts the sacrifices on hold because people don't have anything that they can bring. And I'll get destroyed by these different waves of locusts that came along. And I just need to remind you real quick that I'm looking at a thing right now and it's getting more disturbing as we talk. I'm sorry for the distraction, but I just can't take my eyes off of it given the conversation. We're having more on that again in just a minute. And so the second locust swarm happens in chapter two and it looks more like a figurative locust swarm. We're dealing with something different here and the language of the locust swarm in chapter two seems to be anticipatory of something that is yet to come. And the locusts look like as Joel describes them more carefully, it looks like they're not actually bugs, they're some kind of warriors and God is leading the charge. He's leading this judgment there, flowing over the walls and it's very, very creepy imagery. Well, in keeping with the style of all the profits to this point, Joel is like, we got to repent. What's interesting though is again, he doesn't say like, we got to repent of this. Now Joel, for my money quotes from more books of the Old Testament than any other Old Testament author I've seen so far. It looks like he must be writing very late in the production of the Old Testament because he's familiar, like super, super fluently familiar with all of these themes in scripture. And it looks like he's drawing not only on prophetic word from God, but also he's just deeply rooted in what's already been written down. And he's seeing some themes here that he seems to be drawing toward a future view of completion that is still to come, which is pretty exciting. And we'll get to the second half and that stuff here in a minute. So Joel just generically is like, hey, we got to repent. What of? I don't know. He quotes like eight other books of the Old Testament. Presumably everybody reading the book kind of knew what they were getting wrong and what to repent of. It's just a general repentance that Joel is saying that everybody needs to assume a posture of repentance before God because for a hundred different reasons were on the opposite side of what he wants and what his character is about. And this is clearly the judgment of God, these locus and whatever this visualization of this second locust swarm is all about that he refers to as the day of the Lord. So there's your first half of the book. Now back to the thing that I'm looking at. And down here in my basement all day working on this book of the Bible thinking about it, reading it again and again, trying to understand what the locus are and what do I say to you. And I got my little headphones on here is my little silly self important studio area. I mean, it's just a room in a basement and I've got this great big box soft box light in front of me. It's like four feet across and it's covered in this kind of canvas stuff that softens the light and the whole time that I'm reading Joel. I keep hearing this racket, this fluttering, this noise of paper sliding and because it picks up in the microphone, I just happened to have the headphones on for no good reason. I keep looking around like, what the heck? What is making the noise? And I'm already a little creeped out about locus. And finally, I see it. I look up into this big light that's right in front of me, like straight in front of my face right now as we speak. And I see all these little legs crawling around. And I realize that there is apparently a family of wasps. Is that a thing? And they are huge. They're in there. I can see their feet walking around on the light and I keep hearing them fluttering and moving. And I don't really know how to kill them or get rid of them. But let me tell you that when I started working on the book of Joel, I got to admit that my initial visceral reaction to the upset. And I said, this is about the whole locust swarm thing was like, well, you know, it's a more primitive time. Simpler people freak out over bugs. And you know, I'm sure it was really unfortunate like grasshoppers and stuff that's bummer. That's tough for them. But then I keep hearing this noise in front of me and I look up and I finally see what I'm up against. It's crawling again right there, right in front of me right now. And it's huge. And I'm reminded that maybe it's okay to be a little bit concerned about bugs and what if there were so many of these that it blacked out the sky? I would be mortified. It would be the kind of thing that is such an apocalyptic plague level that the little tiny bit of anxiety I feel right now would instantly shoot to a billion times more. And I would be asking questions about life, death, God, the meaning of everything, the collapse of the universe, whether this was the end of all days and all things. It's a long story short. I'm very grateful to these wasps that are trying to build a hive and reproduce in my light softbox right in front of me today because they made me better understand what Joel was writing to. Thanks danger bugs. Back to what we were talking about in the middle of chapter two during this repentance bit. Joel gives us the most famous line from this book and indeed one of the most famous lines I think from the Old Testament. It goes like this, render heart and not your garments return to the Lord your God for his gracious and compassionate slow to anger and abounding in love. And he relents from sending calamity. Who knows? He may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing, grain offerings and drink offerings for the Lord your God. So obviously Joel is saying, don't do fake repentance. God wants your heart. This is anticipatory of all the stuff that Jesus says in Matthew five and the sermon on the Mount about like external obedience is one thing, but God wants obedience and love devotion at the level of the heart. Well after he gets done saying that kind of stuff, which is thematically beautiful, the whole tone of the whole book pivots. And even though this locust swarm version, this terrifying expression of the day of the Lord is still right there in the rear view mirror, we start to pivot toward another day of the Lord that is also terrifying in its awesomeness, in its wonderfulness. Both are going to represent a gigantic sea change, a gigantic shuffling up of everything. But the second one seems like it's really good. And initially what we get through the end of chapter two and into chapter three is a description of the short term things that God is going to do. And those include being close to his people again as they repent. It includes defeating foreign invaders who were oppressing or being used as a judgment against his people. And it involves fixing and healing the land like at the end Disney movies, when everything turns green again after it was all ruined. There's this visual of the land coming back together and being put back together. God is not going to let this desolation last forever. And it looks like Joel is saying this day of the Lord is in the near term and that the people who are reading this book are going to experience that. But then he goes even further and visualizes a day of the Lord that is in the far distant future and is yet to come. And it's going to have an even bigger effect, but that is going to look like this upcoming near term day of the Lord. And in this grand day of the Lord that is far off and yet to come, there is a restoration of the land. It's like the healing of land. There's another healing of the land, but it's this return to the paradise of the garden. It's this restoration of the land that happens when union between God and man occurs and evil is defeated. There's a grand restoration in view. It's a terrifying sea change, but it's a good terrifying. There's also in this upcoming day of the Lord that's going to happen far, far down the road from now a defeat, not just of the oppressive nations, but of all the nations. They're all going to bend the knee to this God. That'll be a pretty dramatic change and it's going to upset a lot of systems. It will be terrifying, but terrifying in a good way and with a good outcome. And then finally, in the same way, in the near term redemptive day of the Lord that Joel predicts, there will be a reunion of God and his people, a greater intimacy. So in this distant day of the Lord that Joel anticipates God's spirit is going to come and dwell not in a building, but dwell among his people. So Joel is drawing on that imagery that you and I have seen going all the way back to the beginning of the Old Testament with that cloud of the presence of God that dwells in the Ark of the Covenant, that dwells in the tabernacle, that dwells in the temple. The Jeremiah sees departing the temple as the exile Babylon stuff is going on. Where does the spirit of the Lord go next? We're left hanging still over the last few books that we've been reading since Jeremiah. Well somewhere in the future in a beautiful, awesome, terrifying day of the Lord and it looks like there are a few of those predicted throughout Joel. God's spirit is going to dwell among his people. It looks like that gets fulfilled in Acts chapter two when the Holy Spirit shows up, not as the product of a flame in the cloud and the smoke, but the actual thing that makes the cloud and the smoke itself metaphorically, the actual flame, the tongues of fire appear above the heads of the disciples as the Holy Spirit shows up and dwells them. The locust thing is really troubling as a metaphor for the forces of this world and even the forces of nature and the idea of billions, literally billions of independent moving parts, a natural drone swarm, the idea that each and every one of those is operating at the command of the Lord. The none of that is surprising him is baked into what Joel is describing here, but he uses that very powerful, terrifying metaphor to flip it around and be like, well, the God who's powerful enough to do that is powerful enough to deliver in ways that exceed anything you could possibly imagine. And drawing on the imagery of the wasteland created by this horrifying locust swarm that left nothing behind and everything desolate, we get this great image of reversal and hope that God is going to restore this new Eden and restore unbroken fellowship with his people and that the presence of the Lord will dwell among his people again as the evil nations are one day brought to their knees. I'm telling you, Joel is good. This is really well constructed and you can read it multiple times very quickly and you will start to see the patterns and appreciate the beauty of what is happening here. And I think the fact that Joel doesn't carefully locate itself in one moment in time. I mean, really, this could be something written during the era of Israel and Nehemiah. This could be something earlier on in the era of the kings. I really can't tell for sure. And that if anything, just further accentuates the power of the imagery. Obviously, when you visualize Joel picture a locust swarm, when you think about the theme, reflect on real heartfelt repentance in the context of the terrifying and awe inspiring day of the Lord. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to at least read for yourself chapter two versus 13 and 14. But really just sit down with Joel and read the whole thing. It's a win. You can knock it out for yourself and see it for yourself better than I can explain it. All right, my friends, we have leveled up on Joel and now I am going to go see if I can solve a metaphorical locust problem of my own. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Amos. Have you ever got to a place where you look at the insanity of the world and you're like, you know what? There's a time in life when I wanted to go fight about all of this, but now I'm tired and the fighting doesn't seem to accomplish much, and I think I would rather just go farm somewhere. So I'm going to go buy a farm and I'm going to bring some people I love. Maybe I'll just have a family there and it'll be beautiful and we'll listen to classical music and we will not participate in the insanity. If you've ever felt that impulse, then I think you're going to be able to relate to the profit Amos really well because I think this guy just wanted to be left alone. He was a dude from the Southern Kingdom in the mid 700s BC. The Southern Kingdom of course is Judah and he was alive during the reign of a king named Uzziah who was, you know, good enough I suppose. And this isn't exactly a crazy hectic time in the history of the Southern Kingdom. It's fine, but on the other hand up in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the lifetime of Amos, you got a guy named Jeroboam II and he's maybe their rock star king. This is perhaps the zenith of the Northern Kingdom of Israel's economic achievements, architectural achievements. This Jeroboam guy was really good at war. He pacified a bunch of their ancestral enemies for a time and Jeroboam II is very shrewd. He knows that rich, fancy, noble people can get real fussy if they don't keep getting rich or getting and fancier. And so he found all kinds of ways that might have involved a little bit of grotesque injustice here there to keep enriching his cronies and keep everybody in this upper crust ruling class agreeing that they should definitely all get richer even if they might disagree on a few of the finer points of how they want to achieve that. And while definitely being in total agreement that absolutely oppressing everyone beneath their ruling class was completely moral and justified. So you've got gross injustices going on in the north, but up there in the north, in Israel in the mid 700s is so far away from Amos who goes out of his way to explain I think in chapter seven that he's not a prophet. He's not the son of a prophet. He's a guy who takes care of fig trees and sheep and he doesn't really want to be here right now. Yet that's exactly what happens to Amos. He gets roped in away from his life of peace and thrust up into the northern kingdom of Israel to prophesy against them more on how crazy that is in just a minute. But first of all, if you're like me, you're going through all of these Old Testament prophets right now and they start to run together a little bit. Now, of course, if we really stop and think we can separate him out and be like, okay, Joel, that was the locusts. That's that's right. He said, oh, yeah, he did the performance art where he had to marry the prostitute. Now, okay, Ezekiel, ah, he's going to lay in the street and eat the poop roasted food. Okay. Got it. Yeah, yeah, I got it. But in terms of message, it all starts to sound kind of the same, right? Like you were wrong and God is going to judge your wickedness and evil and atrocities and Syria or Babylon or somebody is going to come along and there's going to be this great grand punishment that is coming. And instead you should humble your hearts and return to God. And I just made that all sound really trite. That's not trite. It's like an age old super important message. But because the prophets of the Old Testament, they're presented not chronologically, it can get a little confusing as to who said that stuff first. Well, if we take all the books of the Old Testament prophets section, we line them up chronologically, we discover something really interesting about Amos. And that is that he's the first guy to go and issue prophecies from God against his own people in no uncertain terms. The earliest prophet in the Old Testament is Obadiah. Not everybody agrees on this exact order of things, but we're in the ballpark here in terms of how most smart Bible people would lay these out in order. And then after Obadiah, who pronounces judgment against foreigners and is the nation of Edom, the kingdom of Edom, that Obadiah is getting after. Then after him, you get Joel, who we just talked about. And remember, there's not really a specific target to Joel's prophecy. Maybe a little bit of that is directed against his own people. But overwhelmingly he's talking about God judging the nations in kind of a grand sense. Well, then after that chronologically, we've got Jonah, but you remember who Jonah prophesies against, right? It's Nineveh. Nineveh is in Assyria, aren't the people of Judah of Israel? It's not God's chosen people. Well next up chronologically is Amos. And Amos gets told, you're going to go prophesy a whole bunch of stuff about this age of decadence and wickedness, this gilded age up in Israel under the leadership of Jeroboam II, where everything looks great if you're rich and powerful. But the only reason you're able to be rich and powerful is because you have your boot on the throat of the people who you oppress and crush and this is an opposition to the will of God. So in that respect, at least among the Old Testament prophets who have books named after them, Amos is really one of the first ones, maybe even the first one to go right at God's own chosen people with a withering message of critique. That's interesting the way the book of Amos is structured because he starts off with this little poetic rhythm and he talks briefly about these foreign people groups and God's judgment for them. And the formula goes the same with each of these. It's for three sins of Damascus, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. And then he says some stuff about Damascus. And then for three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. And then we say some stuff about that. And for three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. And maybe if you're in Israel or Judah, you're reading this and you're like, ah, it's great. Yeah, stupid tires, stupid eat them, stupid Damascus. Then we get into chapter two and this says, well, now this is what the Lord says for three sins of Judah, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. I'll just reach everything this is about Judah. It's not much, but it's intense because they have rejected the law of the Lord and have not kept his decrees because they have been led astray by false gods, the gods, their ancestors followed. I will send fire upon Judah that will consume the fortress of Jerusalem. Well, yikes. I mean, we're just a little bit into chapter two right there. If the whole book ended right there, it's pretty effective. You know, all these surrounding nations that God used as an instrument of judgment against his own people, you all are going to get it because stuff screwed up and unjust and wrong backwards there. But also, Judah, don't you sit over there and laugh all smug like you got it coming to. And so, I mean, really that last verse right, I will send fire upon Judah that will consume the fortress of Jerusalem. That kind of sounds like he's predicting what happened in 586 when Nebuchadnezzar, I mean, almost 200 years from the time Amos is writing this is going to show up and topple the southern kingdom. So now the only people at this point in the book who can still sit around and giggle about things are those who are up in the northern kingdom under Jeroboam II on their silk pillows and with their fancy clothing and probably having a good all time laugh and everybody else through two chapters and change. But then the prophet Amos turns his attention to Israel and this many pages are all about everything God has to say about what's going on up there right now. And it is brutal. But back to Amos himself, this guy who just wanted to take care of figs and sheep and be left alone because he didn't want to fight this stuff. He only gets commissioned to speak to his own people of Judah for like, what, four, five sentences there. I read it to you. It didn't take very long. Instead, he is almost presumptuously being thrust into a foreign country, one that frankly is doing very, very well by all external measures and he's told to deliver this oracle from God against them. I'm reading between the lines a little bit here, but it looks like Amos goes up north to this shrine in Bethel that Jeroboam II has set up and he just starts prophesying in front of everybody like maybe street preacher kind of thing. Again, this is from a guy who just probably wanted to be left alone. But here he is and he's not preaching to a Joe blike situation where everyone's trying to make sense of their suffering. He's doing the even harder thing, which is preaching to an Ecclesiastes like situation where no one's really bothering at all that try to make sense of their amazing success. They're just reveling in it without any kind of introspection about the injustices they're perpetuating and even intentionally inflicting on other people to keep this fat lifestyle going. But in the middle of all of that, Amos even points out like you all are still going to quote unquote church. You're bragging about the offerings that you give and how generous they are. You boast about them, but accuses Amos if you meant any of that, you would quit exploiting people and you would have a modicum of introspection about this system that you've built that is not reflective of the values of God. In chapter two and verse eight with Amos criticizing Israel once again, he says, basically, you all lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge in the house of their God. They drink wine taken as fines. The idea being that you're supposed to give a garment a cloak back to somebody at night. If you're holding that because they have it in hawk or in pawn to you because they're poor and you lent them a little bit of money, but like it gets cold at night, you're supposed to give them back the garment. It's straight up in Exodus 22 that you're supposed to do that. Well, the accusation here is you don't do that. You curl up at night in a mountain in a comfy nest of these garments that aren't warming their actual owners on these cold nights and the fines you hit them with for not being able to pay you back fill your glasses with luxuriant wines while they don't have any. Amos is a masterful wordsmith and I could practically just read you the whole book and we could marvel at every one of these vivid pictures that he's painting with words. But for the sake of time, I think we can just boil it down to this in this time. God had blessed the northern kingdom of Israel and they were not giving away what God had given to them. They did not have a heart of gratitude. They did not have a heart of compassion. In fact, quite the opposite. They developed a dark heart of exploitation all while going through this charade of caring about the things of God and Amos is sent from a foreign country to say that is not going to work. God is not impressed. In chapter seven, we get just a little bit of narrative here in Emma Ziah, the priest of Jeroboam II comes to the shrine in Bethel and says, dude, you can't. You got to stop it. Go prophesy somewhere else. And Amos just goes ahead and turns on him and calls him out as a false prophet. And this is where Amos specifies like, I'm not one of these prophets is on the payroll that just says things that are in the national interest. I'm not a bot talking head on a cable news channel that represents one of the parties. I'm a stick and fig farmer, man. I'm not here because this is what I wanted to do with my day. I'm here because thus say it the Lord and Amos concludes this showdown with Amazonia by saying you guys are going to get taken into exile, which of course happens in 722 at the hands of the Assyrians. There's one particular image in Amos that I think sort of encapsulates the whole thing. And it's this moment where God is holding a plumb line in his hand, you know, like a string with a weight tied to the bottom because if you just if you hold that line up with a weight, gravity always tells the truth. And it's going to show you like that's. Straight vertical. It's a building technique. And Amos looks at it and he's like, yep, that is plum. And then he goes on to realize Israel is not plum. It's not square. It doesn't square with truth. And the measure is this ultimate notion of truth held by God as is the case with pretty much all of these prophets. We still get a glimmer of hope and we get a nod to God preserving David's line in the very last few verses. Where the prophet looks to this future day of the Lord where redemption still comes to pass, but Israel, the northern kingdom is going to get it at the beginning of this conversation. I was saying that I don't think Amos went looking for any of this. I think you want to just go out to the wilds, let the ick things happen far, far away. I just kind of farmed some figs and raised some sheep, but God saw the injustice and raised him up. It was like, you're going to be the guy who I send to deal with this stuff to speak to it. That comes through kind of subtly in Amos chapter five, when we see Amos again, railing against the injustice of the north, you trample on the poor and force him to give you grain. Therefore you've built stone mansions. You won't live in them though. You've planted lush vineyards. You won't drink their wine. For I know how many are your offenses and how great your sins. You oppress the righteous and take bribes and you deprive the poor of justice in the courts. Or the prudent man keeps quiet in such times for the times or evil. I think the first part of what I read you there is the Oracle of judgment of God. And I think that last part is Amos being like, normally you would just want to shut up and put your head down when this kind of evil is going on. But really, it's probably when somebody needs to do something, probably when somebody needs to say something the most. This is powerful poignant prophecy from a really long time ago. But I think it is still intended to prompt a response in people who read it today. When you visualize a book of Amos picture that plum line, when you think about the theme, reflect on how God's character and his blessings toward people is supposed to translate into right relationships between us and right justice. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to check out chapter seven versus seven through nine. That's the plum line business. And then that last hopeful bit about David's line being preserved in chapter nine versus eleven through fifteen. There you go. We just leveled up on a little book with a lot going on. We got Amos a little more situated in our hip pocket at this point. Congratulations on that on to the littlest book of the Old Testament next time around. That's Obadiah. I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Obadiah. I had a question for you. What is the most famous opening line of a fiction book that pops into your mind when I ask you that question? What do you got? I'll second think about it literally to 1,000 to 1,000. Did you come up with it was the best of times? It was the worst of times? I'm not kidding. I bet like half of you just said that out loud or mouthed it or thought it. I don't know. That's the right answer. I haven't done a scientific study or anything, but come on. Everybody knows that one's by Charles Dickens from his book A Tale of Two Cities that dates to somewhere in the mid-1800s. That book I think is in part so famous because it's so easy to understand what the exercise is going to be. You pick a book. It says A Tale of Two Cities, and you think to yourself, well, I wonder if we're going to contrast two cities in here. Then you open it in the first line. This is the best of times. It was the worst of times. You're like, oh, I know exactly what the exercise is. Then you read on, and indeed you're getting a contrast between French Revolution era Paris and the relative calm of that era that the people of London experienced just across the English channel. Likewise, I think the premise of this little Old Testament prophetic book of Obadiah is just about as clear. It's a tale of two cities. It's a tale of two peoples. It's a contrast between two very closely related people groups who have a lot of backstory together just like Paris and London do, and Christians reading the text believe that God is prompting Obadiah to weigh in on the relationship between these two cities, these two people groups. At the most basic level, the issue between the two would seem to be that Jerusalem during this little snapshot in time that Obadiah is speaking into Jerusalem, the Israelites, the people of Judah, they're going through a really difficult time. They're in a downswing, and Edom, things are going pretty great over there. They're on an upswing. Good for them. In a moment of trial and difficulty for the people of Judah in Jerusalem, Edom not only doesn't come to their aid, Edom seems to have helped out the other side and then gloated and reveled in the misery and the suffering of their neighbors. And if we look carefully enough back at history, they're brethren, they're cousins because Edom and Israel are not just neighbors in the same way, the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Amalekites, and the Jebusites, they all just come up and all the names might run together. But Edom stands out because they're family. Edom is descended from Esau, and of course Israel is descended from Jacob. Jacob and Esau were brothers. Their dad was Isaac and Isaac's dad was Abraham, to whom God made this promise that there is going to be this great nation and that God was going to bless these people and that all the nations would be blessed through these people. I mean, that'd be a pretty exciting thing. You would want that kind of blessing for yourself. Well, two generations in Jacob steals that blessing from Esau with some cleverness and some manipulation and some advantageous maneuvering. Jacob and Esau have a great big falling out, but eventually Esau's graciousness mollifies that tension between them. But over time, it looks like ensuing generations picked up that grudge and ran with it. And can you blame the Edomites? They look across the Dead Sea. The Edom would be a little bit east and south of Jerusalem and Judah. The Edomites look across the Dead Sea and every single time they see Judah enjoying wealth and success and evidence of the blessings of God. They're going to look at that and be like, that was supposed to be ours. Seriously, one brother out Fox is another brother and now we're out here and there over there should have been us. The Edomites can take a little bit of solace in that they live somewhere really cool. They're up in the mountains and the foothills. They've got that stylish mountain town vibe and mountain economy going. They get cool weather in the summers. They get to build really neat looking cities up there and where they're situated proves to be to their benefit for their longevity. They're a less desirable target to attack than others. So Edom's doing all right for themselves, but there's attention and a resentment that lasts for centuries. And because this is such a long standing tense relationship, it's really difficult to pin a date on the authorship of this book of Obadiah because the book looks like it's flowing out of a moment of betrayal when Jerusalem gets attacked by some outside force. And the feeling is our cousin should have showed up. Jerusalem should have come to our aid, but instead not only did Edom not come to our aid, they helped the invaders, but they just laughed and ridiculed Jerusalem for the horrible things that she was going through. Well, that could really describe one of four times and I don't want to go through all of them in detail. But the quick version is this, Egypt attacked Jerusalem in 926 BC. The Philistines attacked Jerusalem in the mid 800s BC. Israel, the northern kingdom attacked Jerusalem in the southern kingdom around 790 BC. And then of course, the big granddaddy of mall, Nebuchadnezzar from Babylon, finished his conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC. So you can make a pretty strong case that Obadiah is being written during that second invasion, the one with the Philistines, or that last invasion, the one with Nebuchadnezzar. Either way, the tension between Israel and Edom and Edom's failure to have the back of their cousins is the motivation behind the book. Edom is characterized as gloating and delighted in their own power and all of their talent and maybe feeling a little bit vindicated and everything like, well, so much for this promise that Jacob ended up with. Maybe we didn't want that inheritance after all of that's the way it's going to go. God's prophetic word through Obadiah seems to be checking exactly that attitude and saying no, you're not going to escape judgment. So Obadiah overwhelmingly is an edict from God of judgment toward the people of Edom contrasted with a brief statement of blessing about the reestablishment of the kingdom of Israel right at the end of this very little one chapter book. If we're going to continue with this metaphor of a tale of two cities, we have to acknowledge this really imbalanced. Most of this book describes all of the things that Edom would be proud of. It uses a lot of metaphors for them living up in the mountains and imagining that there's security in that it seems to acknowledge them smugly looking physically and metaphorically down on their cousins in Judah. But then the Oracle of judgment says all those things that you are proud of, they're not going to save you. God is going to bring judgment against you and you will be straight up done. The tensact pillaged forced to the border overpowered trapped, cut down in the slaughter. This is the kind of language that is used in verses six through nine verse 10 says because of the violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame. You will be destroyed forever. And then pretty close to the middle of the book, we get another nod to this theme, this motif that keeps coming up in so many of these minor prophets about the day of the Lord in verse 15, it says, the day of the Lord is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you. Your deeds will return upon your own head. Ah ha. So this Obadiah getting after Edom thing isn't just for Edom, but much like what we read in the prophet Joel, there's this day of the Lord idea and this judgment is coming to bring to their knees all of the haughty nations of the world. And then after that one pivot verse about the day of the Lord, then the rest of this little book of Obadiah focuses on the other city, the city that's built on a different mountain, Mount Zion, just as you drank on my holy hill. So all the nations will drink continually. They will drink and drink and be as if they had never been, but on Mount Zion will be deliverance. It will be holy in the house of Jacob will possess its inheritance. The house of Jacob will be a fire and the house of Joseph a flame. The house of Esau will be stubble and they will set it on fire and consume it. There will be no survivors from the house of Esau. The Lord has spoken. And then the last few verses describe the geography of God's kingdom through his chosen people, expanding to cover all of this area, including the mountains of Esau. And then the closing line is, and the kingdom will be the Lords. So to you and me reading this way after the fact, it looks like God getting after one more of Israel's neighbors and promising one more time deliverance and the advent of this kingdom and all that. And it is. And that's great. The original audience, especially after some of these things actually came to pass and played out, this is going to read more like God's final word on a centuries old rivalry that might have come to look like it was 50 50, just imbalance. One side gets the upper hand for a while. The other side gets to the upper hand for a while, just like any old fashioned rivalry. But then God weighs in is like, it's not really like that. I'm going to prop up my people. I'm going to punish my enemies. And I'm going to establish my eternal kingdom. When you visualize the book of Obadiah picture a tale of two cities, but the two cities are crowning to rival mountains. When you think about the theme of Obadiah reflect on the judgment of Edom and the establishment of God's kingdom. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, then I am personally very concerned about your level of busyness. You need to give yourself a break. You're working hard. You're doing your best. It's okay to take a minute to do something else. Jonah, next time around, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Jonah. When I picture Jonah in my head as a book of the Bible, it's a story, I picture something really family friendly and fun and very paintable. In fact, all of the family friendly stories that I picture seem like they would work really well for decorating a kid's nursery or something. And they all have animals in them, you know, the Garden of Eden as animals, Noah's Ark, is giraffe sticking out of there. They all look friendly, they got smiles on them and stuff. Daniel and the lions, then the lions all look friendly. They're not eating anybody. Jonah and the whale, you get the big fish. Of course, when you do art for kids that depict these stories, though, you just carefully crop the image so you don't see the bloated rotting bodies banging up against the whole of the ark and you don't see the decomposing remains of the previous victims of the lions den. And the same is true of Jonah. There's a whole bunch of stuff in here that is very gritty and that prompts very adult introspection as you carefully read through this book. We don't know who wrote the book of Jonah. It seems unlikely that it was written by the title character, especially because of how bad he comes off in this story. It looks like Jonah was prophesying during the reign of Jeroboam II of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. So that would place Jonah somewhere in the middle ish of the 700s BC. It looks like Jonah is being written during this period of Northern Israel's strength and a serious relative weakness. This period of Assyrian weakness is what God is seizing upon as he sends the prophet Jonah knowing that the hearts of the Assyrians, the people of Nineveh, a great Assyrian city in this case, might be more receptive to hearing truth that they might not otherwise listen to during easier times. And so he decides to send his prophet Jonah and the message that God gives Jonah is not really spelled out. It's just go preach against Nineveh because its wickedness has come up before me. All the other prophets we've seen so far are good. God tells them to say stuff and they might be like, I really, I would rather not or this is going to be really hard for me. Maybe they negotiate with God a little bit, but they always do it. Jonah is like, nope, I'm out of here. Jonah gets on a boat to go to the far ends of the world. Some people think Tarsus where he tries to flee to is clear out by like the straits of Gibraltar all the way on the other end of the Mediterranean Sea. The end of the earth as people would have thought of it back then, there be dragons here kind of territory, but the sea turns all choppy. Jonah's down below deck in chapter one and everybody's like, how can you sleep through this? And these pagan sailors, we don't know anything about God. They don't care about any of these things. They're like, yeah, do something. Some in your God. Wow. Well, the prophet is being faithless, but these outsiders are the ones who turn to God. Oh, Jonah's like, okay, well, you know, yeah, I'm kind of a prophet or whatever. And if you throw me over, it'll probably get better. Maybe this was noble of him. Maybe that's just how bad he didn't want to go to Nineveh. It would be better to just be drowned and to die. And then we get a surprise in chapter two. I mean, they do throw him over and things do calm down, but then instead of drowning, Jonah gets swallowed up by this great fish. Now quick aside here. Some people get to this part and very understandably, they're like, ah, man, I'm with you through so much of the Bible, but somebody literally being swallowed by a literal fish. That's tough. You know, stomach acid and stuff in there probably. How do you get air for that long? Is it like that scene in Pinocchio? I just can't picture it. And look, it's a reasonable question. I think one response you might get from a Jewish follower of God or from a Christian would be, let's be honest, this isn't the weirdest thing we've caught God doing. There's a lot of stuff in the Bible where God is breaking the laws of time and space. This is just one more way that he's breaking it. Other Jewish followers of God or Christians might hear that question and say, well, there's something going on here is a literary example. Maybe there's a degree of literalness to it. Maybe not still other people would look at that and be like, ah, the Jesus points to this story. And he seems to treat it literally the point being we could go much further down that rabbit hole, but reasonable followers of God have looked at this text and said, yeah, there's some kind of metaphor going on here mingled with historical reality. The original audience would have been aware of this technique. Other reasonable followers of God are going to look at that and be like it looks like it reads like straight history. And if it seems weird, well, you're dealing with God and he can do weird things. Either way, the result is the same. The owner's in there and he has a spiritual awakening inside the belly of this fish and he prays to God. And it's really a pretty beautiful prayer in my distress. I called to the Lord and he answered me from the depths of the grave. I called for help. I mean, obviously if that sounds very sall me, it should. And if that language likening being in the belly of the fish to being in the belly of the earth or in the grave sounds familiar, it should as well because Jesus makes allusion to this story likening the belly of the fish to the grave he would be in a couple different times in the book of Matthew as well. Well, apparently God hears the prayer and all we find out about how God answers the prayers that he made the fish barf up Jonah on dry land. So then Jonah's like, okay. And to me at least chapter three makes it look like now that he's not in the belly of a fish. He doesn't have his head screwed on quite as straight anymore. And he is big grudgingly on his way to Nineveh. And as I'm reading through this thing in the context of all these other Old Testament prophets, I'm like, this is going to be a good oracle. There's going to be a lot here. But then you get to the thing that Jonah preaches and it's bare bones, almost like he's holding back the majority of it to just say the minimum amount of stuff he has to say, almost in a gesture of self sabotage to make sure he gets the outcome he wants. So this is his whole sermon to them as it's recorded 40 more days and Nineveh will be overturned. And it looks like he just walked around the streets of Nineveh just saying that in my opinion, clearly hoping they would not respond to it. So he would get what he wanted, which is the judgment of the Ninevites. But that begs the question, why does Jonah want Nineveh to get destroyed so bad? What's your problem with these guys, man? Well, really everybody had a problem with Nineveh for to be totally fair. Nobody liked Assyria. They were cruel. They were awful. They were ruthless. As I mentioned earlier, it looks like during this period, Syria was wobbling a little bit. And Jonah probably wanted the knock out blow and further, he was probably completely justified in that. But another reason I think Jonah is so fixated on God destroying Nineveh completely with no ambiguity or possibility to put it back together is for the sake of Jonah's own reputation as a prophet. Get this back in 2 Kings 14, we find out the Jerobo and the 2 Kings of Israel, the northern kingdom took advantage of this period of Assyrian weakness and he went and he conquered a whole bunch of territory. And the text says that this is in keeping with the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet Jonah, son of Amatai, exact same guy. So Jonah is probably feeling pretty good about that because he prophesied in favor of the military exploits of the king. But then just a few years later, Amos comes along. Remember, he's the southerner who goes up north to prophesy against Jerobo on the 2nd and God through Amos reverses that prophecy or at least augments it in Amos 6, 14. And God says that he's going to stir up a nation against you and he's going to oppress you throughout all of that freshly conquered land. So Jonah prophesies like God likes you and you're going to take it and then they do take it, but Amos then immediately prophesies and now it's going to be a nightmare. Maybe Jonah felt betrayed by this. Maybe he felt like God was flip flopping and making him look stupid, hanging him out to dry. Maybe all the more, Jonah's like, see, that's the kind of stuff you get when you prophesy in the court of Jerobo and the 2nd. God just doesn't have your back the way he should. He should be looking out for his own prophet, people who are loyal to him and not these clowns, these oppressors from some other country admittedly, I'm really putting words in his mouth. But I think it's a fair attempt at an explanation for how weird Jonah is being about this whole Nineveh thing will get this. Jonah trots out this pathetic version of a call to repentance. I mean, it's nothing compared to everything else that we see throughout the Old Testament prophets. And weirdly, the king of Nineveh, who's not the king of Assyria, it's a local king, is like, you know what, you got a point and we've done wrong. Maybe God will still relent if we repent and we turn to him. And then everybody repents. There's this giant religious revival in Nineveh. And then right at the end of chapter three, it says, when God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened. So in chapter four, Jonah is feeling burned by God again. This is why I didn't want to go. And he's complaining to God and he's set up shop on a hillside to look at the city of Nineveh, hoping for some Sodom and Gomorrah treatment. And as he's camped out there, grumpy and angry about everything, mad about God showing compassion to the wrong people, God shows compassion to him and he raises up this vine to give him shade. And Jonah's like, you know what, things have not been good lately, but I like my vine. This is great. Well, the next morning, God sends a worm to eat the vine and the vine gets eaten such that it no longer provides shade. And so now Jonah, who's gone through this tremendous personal calamity of having his pet vine destroyed and not getting to see an entire city of people wiped out before his eyes goes all Job's wife because of that tremendous suffering, much like Job's family and says, I just, I should just die. And then the last word of the book is God saying it's a vine, dude. Paraphrases mine of vine. And you didn't even have it yesterday. How much more valuable is a city of a hundred and twenty thousand people who are paraphrases mine here, like sheep without a shepherd who can't tell their left hand from the right. And on top of that, how about just the animals? Should I not be concerned about that great city? Boom. And that's the end with that rhetorical question. And that's it for the book about a prophet who doesn't really do what God wants him to do except begrudgingly and who gets super mad when God shows compassion to people who aren't him. So why is this book in here? Well, one, again, it shows the sovereignty of God over history, over nature, over kings, all that kind of stuff. Two, it probably serves as some sort of historical theological explanation to his own people as to why God didn't wipe out the oppressive Assyrians sooner. Three, it's starting to really emphasize this idea that God is building a bigger family of faith and that his promise to Abraham back in the day that all the nations would be blessed is for real as we see outsiders who shouldn't get it, getting it, and an insider who should get it, not getting it, which for brings us to this place of personal introspection that I was talking about back at the beginning. I think this book is meant to take you on a fun roller coaster ride of adventures, but then you're supposed to get to the end and be like, Oh, dang it. I'm like Jonah. I can act like that. I can think this way and thinking like that makes no sense in terms of the grace of God and the mercy of God. But if he shows mercy to people, I didn't want him to show mercy to I need to get over myself and be grateful that God would ever relent and ever show compassion to anyone because I need that compassion to and maybe as a fifth little bonus bit here, there's tons of illusions to things that are going to happen in the life of Jesus and his teachings, especially as they're represented in the book of Matthew. When you visualize Jonah, just picture the big fish. It'll get you where you need to go. When you think about the theme, reflect on God's sovereignty and his love for outsiders and even his patience with somebody who doesn't like God's compassion when it's for other people and not for him. If you don't have time to read the whole thing and you should have time to read the whole thing, this one goes real quick. But if you don't, check out chapter two, which is Jonah's prayer inside that fish and chapter four, which is that dialogue between Jonah and God right there at the end. What a great book. All right, we're wrapping it up there. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. This podcast is supported by many of you at at patreon.com slash the TMVH podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Micah. In the first two chapters of the Book of Micah, we meet a guy who's from a small town, a long ways away from Jerusalem, a guy who clearly is going to be talking to the normal people of Judah, and one of his chief gripes that apparently God told him to call out amongst his own people was this practice of the government getting in bed with business and then cornering the market on everything and then engaging in these predatory business practices by which they'd wait for somebody to have a couple of bad harvests in a row and then snatch their ancestral family land out from under them. You're not supposed to do that according to the Bible, but again, that ship had sailed. This starts happening left and right. And now what you have is such a weird imbalance in an agricultural society where if you don't have land, you're effectively a serf, a servant class. You got a situation where through all entirely, technically legal means the paperwork you'll see is entirely in order through entirely those kind of shenanigans. What happened is you created this elite ownership class and everybody else became a subject class and that wasn't God's design for what his holy people set apart for him and set apart to model the values of his character in his kingdom was supposed to look like. In fact, these land grabs and all these other exploitative practices made it impossible for God's chosen people to live out life in community the way he said they were supposed to, which was supposed to be a beacon to and a blessing to all the nations. So what we get in Micah is because they were unable to pull this off instead of the nations being drawn to them by the beauty of their system and their relationship with God and coming to the temple to learn from them about God and about truth. Instead, they're going to come to the temple. All right, but it's not going to be to learn. It's going to be to take your stuff and burn down your corrupt evil system and God through the prophet Micah seems to be saying, and this is actually for the best. This is what needs to happen. God's justice must be satisfied. And that phrase is scary, right? I mean, you hear that and you're like, well, why not be nice God? Don't think about yourself. I'm going to try not to think about me here, but obviously I want God to be nice to me. But think about the injustices that boil your blood, the evilest worst stuff that's happened in history that you see on the news. You see going on all around you and you can't come up with a solution because the system has baked in this evil. Think about how much you yearn for justice for that. Well, God is God of justice according to what we see throughout the Old Testament. He doesn't like it either. And he's the one who's in a position to occasionally do something about this massive injustice that we don't have the political will or creativity to address. And so throughout the book of Micah, what we get is one, two punch. The left comes in and it's usually a pretty big dominant left. And this is the oracle of judgment for injustice and evil and depression. And for everybody be in complicit for building a system that is just straight up, not reflective of the values of God, then in comes the right punch. And it's this near term and long term promise of redemption. Every time you start to feel like, Oh, no, God is super mad and everything will be crushed and destroyed, swept up in his righteous and just judgment. You're like, Oh, wait, maybe not everything. No, no, there is hope here. God is going to restore and redeem this left hook of judgment is then complemented with a right hook of forgiveness. I'm not sure that analogy holds up, but I think you know what I mean. And so chapters one and two describe a lot of those evil practices that we were talking about just a minute ago. And then chapter three specifically calls out the leaders who enable that kind of thing. It specifically calls out the kind of nonsense prophets who Amos was pointing out when in his book, he's like, I'm not a prophet. I'm not even a son of a prophet. What was he saying? Well, in part, he was saying, you get this whole profit class where they just get paid to say whatever you want. It's kind of like the cable news class where each party can just weaponize their team to go out and make truth, just make truth, say some oracles. There's a study. They're peer reviewed. Something just say this and make it true. And the people who already like what we think, then they'll have a thing they can say, and thus say it the study. And it'll feel like truth is the same deal. It was just that people didn't go to studies back then to gather truth that they could trot out and beat other people over the head with. They went instead to, we're pretty sure God says this. Well, all of these prophets we're looking at who are prophesying in the mid 700s, maybe with the exception of Jonah, Amos, Jose, Micah, Isaiah, they're all pushing back on these fraud prophets and this fraud profit culture. And there's a reason we know basically none of the names of those people who just got paid to say things were from God that weren't from God. And there's a reason we do know the names of these people who gave up so much socially and financially to say things that were true to people who didn't want to hear it, but needed to hear it. But then after three chapters, we've absorbed the left hook of judgment and now we get the, let's go with instead of right hook, let's go with the friendly right hand of forgiveness. As Micah uses language that is reminiscent of what we just caught in Obadiah in the last days, the mountain of the Lord's temple will be established as chief among the mountains. It will be raised above the hills and people will stream to it. Many nations will come and say, come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob. He'll teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths. Well, you can't very well have that if all of those paths are weird and crooked and twisted up and perverted from what God had declared they should be. And so what we see as we get into chapter four is that this judgment wasn't just to satisfy God's righteous, completely fair anger over horrible injustices. It's also that there's a whole redemptive plan going on here. Don't forget that part. In chapter four goes on to sound a lot like the message of Isaiah about the busted up stuff being straightened out and things being made right and this gross, unjust system that feels like it's never going away. Well, both Isaiah and Micah both say, no, it's going to go away. It's going to be replaced by something better. In fact, the first three verses of Micah four are effectively identical to Isaiah chapter two, including this language right here. The laws will go out from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem Zion from that mountain that Obadiah was talking about is so cool. How it all hangs together. He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plow shares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation nor will they train for war anymore. In this regard, Micah is saying this to the common people. While Isaiah is in the courts of kings, saying this to the fancy people, the message is the same. There is a great king who is coming. This kingdom, this redemptive plan is still going to happen. It's going to go far beyond the boundaries of little Judah and the little Israel all the way out to all the nations. And humanity, as we understand it, is going to be transformed by this dramatic kingdom work of God. But there's some judgment and some cleaning up that's going to happen before that. Well, then in chapter five, we get the passage that probably you have heard from Micah that maybe everybody knows from Micah. It's very predictive of something that's still to happen in the future. And Micah is filled with predictions. He isn't just doing oracles of judgment. He is calling his shot on a ton of things. He predicts the fall of the north. He predicts the fall of the south. He predicts the conquest by Babylon. He predicts the exile in Babylon. He predicts the return from exile. And right here, he predicts in smoking gun language that the promised great king, the descendant of David, the one who's going to reign on the throne forever is going to be born in Bethlehem. And stuff's going to start to change. Micah 5, too. But you, Bethlehem, Ephraetha, though you were small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me, one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old from ancient times. And then the last two chapters are kind of a microcosm of what's going on in the whole book and maybe in a way what's going on in all of the minor prophets. It's held out as almost a court case where God gives an indictment against his people. This is the injustice and the evil and the wickedness that's going on there. And then Israel starts to come around and there's some humility and awareness and there's a degree of repentance and there's hope that comes with that. And out of that response to the indictment, we get maybe the other most famous verse from Micah, which boils everything down and demonstrates a contrite heart of repentance and understanding for what they'd gotten wrong. The Micah was charging them with, it goes like this, he has showed you, oh man, what is good and what is the Lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. I love that verse. I've often thought when I felt really overwhelmed by the Bible and theology and church history and Christianity, all this stuff. I just wish I could talk to God for a minute, like a conversation just between people face to face or whatever. And I know exactly what I'd ask him, hey, in this life, in this world, cutting through all the noise and all of everything else, if I get everything else wrong, what do I need to get right? And I think this is one of those passages that actually gives me the answer to the question. Well, I should act justly and love mercy and walk humbly with my God. And then the other one, I think this is when Jesus is like, what's the greatest command? I love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, soul, mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself. All of the law is summed up in that. So from just a very personal perspective, I find that to be a very meaningful, very clarifying, very simplifying passage. And apparently Micah is holding it out as though this concept would deserve the same purpose for the people of Israel. And as we get down toward the end, we get this final bit where we hear about what the blessings are going to be for God's chosen people moving forward and how this dovetails with the grand redemptive plan. Micah is a beautiful book written in a way that is made to make sense to normal people and to acknowledge that the problems in this world aren't really far away in some fancy house or on some fancy throne. Yeah, that's problematic too. But the problems in the world are also on us. We have ownership of the things that we have made, but the values of God's character and God's kingdom are contrary to those things. And even though God will do justice as we should want him to do, that is not the end game. Rather, that's the setup for this grand redemption that is right and beautiful and just and lasting. And in that regard, it's a pretty exciting book. When you visualize the book of Micah, just picture the manger in Bethlehem where Jesus was born hundreds of years later. So we're going to visualize the manger when we think about the theme, reflect on justice and forgiveness and restoration for the long haul. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go back and read for yourself the beginning of chapter five, anticipating Jesus' birth in Bethlehem. Get six, eight, which I just talked about a second ago. And then get that last section from chapter seven versus 11 through the end of the chapter in verse 20. And with that, you've unlocked a new achievement and so have I. We got Micah. All right, name whom? Next time around. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Nehem. If you just pick up a Bible and start reading straight through it, you will get a whole lot of Nineveh in the book of Jonah, which describes events that happened in the mid-ish 700s BC. Well, at least part of it happens in Assyria, this great evil nation to the north that oppresses people, and everybody around Assyria hates Assyria and cannot wait for Assyria to go away. And as you'll recall with Jonah, he doesn't even want to go preach there, because he's deep down, suspicious that God is going to relent, and that he is going to forgive the people if they repent. And so he's fussy, and he goes and he phones it in and does a terrible job, a tank job on his preaching, but for some weird reason, the king of Nineveh relents, and everybody asks for God's forgiveness. And sure enough, God's like, okay, I'm going to spare all those people. That's a lot of people. Even a few more prophetic books go by, and the next time we get a really good look at Nineveh is in the prophetic book that we're looking at today, which is Nahum. This book is written about a hundred years later, and kind of a lot's happened since we last saw Nineveh. For example, one of the two most notable things that has happened in Nineveh in the interim totally forgot all of that stuff about Jonah, and what they said they were going to do, and the repentance thing and all of that business, it did not stick. Maybe it did for a generation? I don't know. It looks like in the reign of Jeroboam II, who was the king in the early 700s BC, up to somewhere in the mid 700s BC in the northern kingdom of Israel. It looks like during that time of Jeroboam II, Israel was really powerful and able to expand their borders as Jonah predicted they would be able to. They were able to do that because Assyria was in a downswing. We don't know exactly what the problem was there, but there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Assyria was having a leadership crisis, and they were wobbling at that time. Maybe that's why the people of Nineveh were in a place where they were willing to respond before they weren't the big dogs anymore. They were a little shaken, a little uncertain about their future, but we also know that after that time that Jonah was up there, things got back on track pretty quick for Assyria and Nineveh, which is a big Assyrian city. And as soon as they pulled it back together, they got back to conquering and being very, very violent and evil and oppressive as they had always been in the past. So I'm guessing that the Ninevites were like, yeah, I don't know. We're good now. We can trust in our swords and spears and chariots and our money, and we'll just move forward, kind of forgetting that embarrassing incident where we acted like we believed in a foreign deity. Actually, speaking of that foreign deity, we should go conquer those people. And I guess that's the second big notable thing that happens between the scene and Nineveh in Jonah and the mentioning of Nineveh that we're getting here in the Book of Nahum is in 722, the regrouped retooled Assyrians comes out and they conquer and completely destroy and subjugate the northern kingdom of Israel. Boom, that's it. Gone to history. Well, a few years later, they decide to press their luck a little further and go and attack Jerusalem and only barely, perhaps because the good counsel of Isaiah and Micah were still floating around. Only barely does King Hezekiah depend on God enough to see God's miraculous deliverance and to sustain the southern kingdom of Judah for what would end up being about another 125 years. So in a way, Nahum is kind of the follow up to Jonah and get that loose end flapping around. Well, whatever happened with the Assyrians, whatever happened with Nineveh up there, Nahum gives us an answer. They reverted in a lot of ways they were even worse than they were before, and now they are the object of God's wrath. For a long time, everybody's been wanting to see Assyria go away. But now God has decided it's time for Assyria to go away. So in the most literal sense, then, Nahum's book is dedicated to predicting the complete ruinous destruction of Nineveh at the hands of the Babylonians and indeed that did happen in 612 BC. Now, you might be thinking, all right, we've looked at a lot of these Old Testament prophets and there's always some judgment stuff in there, but then there's also some stuff about the descendant of David raining on the throne and God straightening everything out. It's not quite as present in Nahum though. What we get here are a few verses at the beginning that draw on language from other parts of the Old Testament, particularly Exodus 34. And it's a statement of the glory of God and the character of God and also why you should be afraid of that if you're an evil oppressive empire. The Lord is a jealous and avenging God. The Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies. The Lord is slow to anger and great in power. The Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm and clouds are the dust of his feet and you, Nineveh are about to reap the whirlwind. This little opening bit that talks about these positive attributes of God who is a God of justice who will defend the oppressed, that section wraps up with this very well-known beautiful line. The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him. And then we get a hard pivot for the rest of the book of Nahum into Nineveh. Yeah, your time is up. You're going down. It's going to be at the hands of Babylon and it is going to be ugly. And the tone of the whole book is more or less, hey, when you're being towered over by your enemies and they're about to shame you and run you through and when nobody comes to help you and you are defeated and alone and everyone you've oppressed celebrates your defeat, just know that was me, God. Obviously, I'm paraphrasing a little bit there, but I do think that characterizes the tone of the book. We get here to the end and it says, Oh, King of Assyria, your shepherd slumber, your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them. Nothing can heal your wound. Your injury is fatal. Everyone who hears the news about you claps his hands at your fall for who has not felt your endless cruelty. The end. That's the end of the book. There's no little pick me up positive encouraging thing at the end. The intonation of the book is that unless you are an evil, oppressive, vile, violent, horrible, wicked empire, you're going to like this book and you're going to like what happens to Nineveh because they had it come in and it needed to happen. And back to the actual historical details of Nineveh's defeat. When they went down, they went down hard. Nineveh got consigned to the sands, forgotten to history so much so that critics of the Bible in the 1700s and 1800s, here's just a couple hundred years ago, looked at Nineveh and they were like that right there. It factors so prominently in the Bible, but if there was really a city that was that big a deal and that was that big, it would still be there. Maybe the Bible is fake, probably the Bible is fake, they would say. Well, then some people go and dig in the right place in the desert near modern day Mazel Iraq and sure enough, there's Nineveh right where it should be. And so much of what you see in the British Museum from the age of Assyrian art is all from Nineveh, which got utterly toppled and wrecked by Babylon, which would have been cathartic in ways I'm not sure you and I could understand to the original audience here. But there's a bigger point to Nahum and that is in keeping with the bigger point of the book of Joel. You remember that one? Joel doesn't really have a specific target. There's not like you, this country, you're in trouble. It's the nations. The God is going to judge the institutional evil and the specific evil and the evil leaders of the nations that don't think for a minute that this stuff is going to go unchecked and just be allowed to breathe. It might not happen on the timeline that you and I would like for our sense of justice, but God sees it. He will judge the nations. There will be this grand day of the Lord, as I suppose in a sense, there is a day of the Lord described in Nahum, a terrible day of the Lord for Nineveh. So there will be this grand day of the Lord where God corrects this injustice and straightens these things out, not just to the benefit of one singular little narrow group of people, but to the benefit of this grand new we discover family of faith that is going to be created in Jesus. Nahum's a banger. I like this book. Nahum is fast and hard hitting and intense and I like it. And when you visualize it, just picture Nineveh in ruins. When you think about the theme, reflect on God bringing judgment against all the evil and oppression of the world, the stuff that you know deep down at the level of the soul needs to be straightened out as well. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least read the first eight verses. You might be getting through these prophets with me and being like, wow, God's judgment against everybody and everything is going to correct all this evil. And you might be thinking like, what about my evil though? Cause I have some stuff that I've done, just thought and it hurt some people that probably wasn't the best thing ever. What about that? Well, that question is supposed to be one that we are grappling with and thinking about. And in that regard, the Old Testament prophets by just hammering this tone of God's justice and his judgment are meant to point us to what happens with Jesus as we get to the New Testament. That's sort of the big payoff. All right, my friends, achievement unlocked on Nehum. Next time around, we got Habakkuk. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Habakkuk. Habakkuk is a prophet to the southern kingdom of Judah. It looks like his job was to show up right at the end, the last little bit of time. Before Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians would show up and topple Judah. So I guess he would have been working at the same time that Jeremiah was. And it looks like Habakkuk's job, even though we don't really know much about him at all, was to say, hey, Babylon's coming, this thing is going to happen. But instead of getting that oracle of judgment from Habakkuk, like we do in pretty much all of the other minor prophets, instead what we get is a conversation between Habakkukkuk and God, because Habakkuk doesn't like it. He has some objections. He has some problems with this strategy. And it's just assumed that Habakkuk went and said what you would expect him to say, given everything else we have here in this part of the Old Testament to his people about God's judgment against them and about Babylon and all of that. But it's interesting because that isn't what's preserved. We get that in other places. What's preserved is I think a fairly reasonable question that someone in his shoes, or maybe anybody's shoes, could ask of God and it unfolds over the course of three chapters. Chapters one and two are Habakkukk asking a couple of questions and God answering those questions. And then in chapter three, we see Habakkuk get it. So we're on a character arc, a character journey here for Habakkukk, who might not like how things are going to work out, but he comes around to understanding and trusting in the character of God by the time he gets to the end of things. So we're probably looking at a timeframe here about 20 years before Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians showed up, but the writing is already on the wall. No pun intended. That was an accident, but I'm going to keep it. And I think at this point, any honest person in Judah knew they were in trouble. They were happy to see the Assyrians get defeated. Maybe five, six years before Habakkukk is writing this stuff down. Stupid Assyria, their awful Nahum gives us that tone of celebration and joy that everybody else would have had about the end of Nineveh and the Assyrians. But it turns out they were out of the frying pan and into the friar here because Babylon has their eyes set on conquest as well. And now clearly they're going to be coming for Jerusalem. So the oracle that Habakkukk, the prophet received, well, doesn't really read like much of an oracle at all. Instead, it opens with a question, how long, oh Lord, must I call for help, but you don't listen or cry out to you violence, but you don't save. Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong destruction and violence are before me? There's strife and conflict abounding. Therefore the laws paralyzed and justice never prevails and the wicked hem in the righteous so that justice is perverted. So this question is basically, hey God, if you're telling me to go and say that the end is at hand and it looks like that's not all clear to Habakkukk totally at this point in the conversation just yet, why haven't you done anything about it already? Why didn't you come and correct us? Why didn't you make this evil that's happening in Judah? Stop. It's everywhere. We're a broken people. And then God gives Habakkukk an answer. And he's like, hey, actually I have heard your concerns. I'm aware of it and you'll be happy to know I'm doing something about it. Maybe at that moment Habakkukk was like, oh, you know, great. But God keeps going. He's like, yeah, I'm raising up the Babylonians who you've no doubt heard of. And I'm going to have them come and conquer you entirely and haul everyone away into captivity. And so we're going to put an end to all that evil and violence that you're talking about going on here in Judah. And then Habakkukk in chapter two is like, wait, what? What? And that is not what I had in mind. I want the evil to be corrected. Don't get me wrong. But and it's almost like you can hear him formulating his case. But you can't use Babylon. They're even worse than us. They're more violent. They show even more disregard for you. They're more dangerous than us. And so many words he's saying, we're the lesser of two evils here. And he provides a little mental imagery here as he wraps up the second question to God. And he's like, I'm going to stand here like a watchman on the wall and keep my eyes peeled for your reply. I'm going to need an answer on this. And then God does answer. And he's like, oh, yeah, no, no, I'm well aware of how awful Babylon is. And really all of these nations are. Oh, yeah, I see it. No, they're going to get theirs too. They will be the object of my wrath and correction as well. You're going to have to trust me and you're going to have to wait on me. But that is going to happen. And then God reminds Habakkuk in so many words. I can use corrupt evil nations to accomplish my good purposes. And then as if just to make it crystal clear to Habakkuk that God totally understands, not just that Babylon is generically bad, but that God understands exactly how Babylon is evil. He lists out these five woes. And the first couple of them talk about the economic evil and oppression that goes on in Babylon. The third one talks about how they depend on slave labor. And we see God's condemnation of that there. The fourth one talks about how people are getting liquored up and making horrible decisions. And their leaders are a joke. They're botched. And then the fifth woe deals with the idolatry, not just the cheap idolatry, like the old Canaanites, but an idolatry that is a worship of the state, something that we see the exiles come up against in the incidents described in Daniel with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and with Daniel and the lion's den. And after that, we get into the final chapter and the final movement of the story. And Habakkuk who probably had to reflect on this a little bit longer, I would think, but maybe he didn't. He snaps out of it. He's like, all right, that's a proper defense. That makes perfect sense. I need to trust you and I need to wait on you. I have no other choice than this anyway and come to think of it. Nobody ever thought that you were going to do anything about Egypt, but you were working on that the whole time. And so in a way, the judgment that you brought upon the Egyptian oppressors causes us to trust that you will judge the nations and do the things that you say you are going to do. And so in this respect, we see the book of Habakkuk walk us through a process that's kind of like the opposite of how the book of Micah, a couple books ago, wrapped up with God putting Israel on trial and offering a couple of charges, questions, accusations against them. Well, this time around Habakkuk's God on trial and God looks good and smart and right, whether he's the one on trial or the one putting people on trial. We also see Habakkuk twinning up with the book of Job here. Job went through all of this process. Everybody saying this is why the suffering is happening. This is why things don't make sense. And in the end, he charged God with being wrong. I got a problem with you and how you run things. And God puts him in his place and Job is like, you're right. You're right. I'm humbled. I have no choice but to trust you and your goodness and your power. And I won't do that. And that's the exact same place that Habakkuk ends up. And so for the reader today, I think Habakkuk's a wildly encouraging book, not just because Babylon got beat a long time ago. And indeed, they did get defeated eventually. But because there's been a thousand metaphorical Babylon's since. And pretty much all of us live in one of those where evil and oppression and wrongdoing and worship of the state as though it's a God go unchecked. And we might be tempted to despair like Habakkuk was at the beginning and be like, why are you using things that are more evil to punish things that are less evil? Why aren't you resolving all of this evil and wickedness? Why aren't you shutting down these evil nations and this awful corruption? Well, then we see the journey that Habakkuk goes on. And maybe as a reader, we come to a place of saying, okay, I'm supposed to hate all of that evil. I'm supposed to want to see that resolved and dealt with. Maybe I'm supposed to even play a role in that at times, but mostly I am to trust that God who is just sees in great detail the evil and the wickedness and that there will be an accounting for it and that he will judge the nations. When you visualize the book of Habakkuk, picture that watchman on the wall when you think about the theme, reflect on how God is just and good and how he will defeat all of the evil from all of the empires. If you don't have time to read the whole thing and hopefully you can make time, this one's very doable, very easy to follow with. If you can't, though, at least check out Habakkuk 2, verse 4 and all of the completion of Habakkuk's character arc in chapter 3. Achievement unlocked, that's Habakkuk, internet high five. Nice job, my friends. On to Zephaniah next time around. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Zephaniah. I got a whole bunch of friends who are engineers and into physics and stuff, and I'm sure they know the name of this particular phenomenon. I don't know the name, but I can describe it. Maybe you've seen it. It's the deal where you see somebody going down a hill way too fast on like a skateboard, and things look good at first, but then you notice that they're starting to sway back and forth. They're starting to wobble back and forth. That weird speed wobble thing is some kind of oscillation. And once that speed wobble and the correction and the over-correction and the correction and the over-correction starts, it's no longer a question of if that kid is going to wipe out. The question is, when is that kid going to wipe out and how ugly is it going to be when it happens? You can see the calamity coming from a really long ways away. Likewise, Zephaniah is one of the last prophets to the southern kingdom of Judah. He's operating in the last quarter of the 600s, and that speed wobble has already started with the people of Judah. It's coming apart. It's going downhill too fast. They're not going to be able to get it back under control, but Zephaniah gets thrust into that situation anyway to try to speak truth and see if somehow the prophetic word of the Lord through him can bring about some kind of correction. And if you go back and look at 2 Kings, you can see that it looks like it kind of worked there for just a minute after a whole bunch of really lousy kings have been in charge for 50-ish years, along comes this kid Josiah. And Josiah has this encounter with the book of the law, and his heart is broken over what they've gotten wrong, and he starts engaging in all of these reforms, and there's this moment at the very end of the several hundred-year run of the southern kingdom of Judah where it looks just for a second. Like maybe they will defy the odds and be that one exception where the speed wobble starts, but they pull out of it somehow. But then they don't. Josiah dies in an ill-advised battle, and the stench of what is wrong with Judah and the whole southern kingdom is so systemic. It's so worked into the fabric at this point that they just can't clean it up. They can't pull out of the speed wobble, even though everybody watching knows they're in speed wobble mode, and even though they know we're in speed wobble mode, they can't fix it. Zephaniah is a guy who saw this coming from a very long ways away, and he was uniquely positioned to do so, not just because he was a prophet, but he was royal blood. This guy was the great-grandson of King Hezekiah. Hezekiah was a good king. But what that means is Zephaniah is different than any of these other prophets we've been seeing. He doesn't just know how to mingle in the court life and with the fancy people. He's one of them, which means he's giving up a tremendous amount, much like Josiah, to say, this isn't going to work. We need to admit the situation that we're in, and we need to repent. But despite how unpopular that no doubt must have been in his circle of acquaintances, he still said it, and he still called all of those fancy people and all of their fancy outfits who were doing the noble court life thing to very public repentance. And depending on when we understand this story that was recorded in the book of Zephaniah to have occurred, it's possible that this is part of what inspired what went right during the reign of King Josiah. It may well be that what we're getting in the book of Zephaniah is something that kind of looks like the second half of the book of Jonah, where the king of Nineveh is like, hey, who knows? Maybe God will relent and show mercy on us, and then God does. But as we discussed in our conversation about the book of Nahum, it's not very long. And Nineveh is like, yeah, forget it. We're going back to the way we used to do things, and then they meet their ruin. Well, that's how it plays out here as well. In the middle of the speed wobble, it looks like Judah responds to this message and says in so many words, maybe God will relent. Here's the call to repentance from Zephaniah in chapter two after a scathing pronouncement of judgment through all of chapter one against Judas is gathered together, gather together, a shameful nation before the appointed time arrives and that day sweeps on like chaff before the fierce anger of the Lord comes upon you before the day of the Lord's wrath comes upon you. There's that day of the Lord concept again. Seek the Lord all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands, seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lord's anger. So it really does have a similar feel back to the book of Jonah when we see a prophecy that worked. And by that, I don't mean like one where there was a prediction and then it came true. We're seeing a lot of that. By that, I mean a prophet went and said you need to repent and then someone actually did and then God relented. But when you go back and look through all of the charges in chapter one against Judah, it's the same stuff we've been seeing everywhere else. It's this indictment of an evil that has gone so deep and that is so beyond political solution. And as we keep observing this pattern through the words of all of these different prophets calling out this systemic culture wide evil, the sense that we're getting is that all of this evil is interconnected. It's like there's so many little points of wrongdoing and darkness and injustice between people, broken relationships, broken trust that eventually that has a cumulative effect. And the consequences, the destruction of the soul of that society or to run even further with our little ongoing metaphor, the crash at the end of the speed wobble. Well, after that called repentance at the beginning of chapter two, then you get an allusion to some great superpower that is going to come and steamroll everybody, all of the neighboring kingdoms that have been a pain in the butt for Judah, they're getting steamrolled. Judah's getting steamrolled. Heck, Assyria is getting steamrolled. There's even another prophecy in here against Nineveh. I mean, this one was probably a bit of a crowd pleaser for everyone. Like, all right, well, we're going to crash and burn, but Nineveh's going down to, I mean, check out this language about Nineveh. This is the carefree city that lived in safety. She said to herself, I am and there is none besides me. What a ruin. She has become a layer for wild beasts, all who pass by her scoff and shake their fists. And as we talked about when we were looking at the book of Nahum, that's exactly the fate that fell Nineveh, which fell so hard in the sands of the desert that it was completely lost to history for another 2300 years after the event. And I is predicting here and Nahum was predicting in his book. Then in chapter three, we get a denunciation of all of the corrupt lousy leaders of Jerusalem for their dereliction of duty and lack of character. Then we get this little nugget that is reminiscent of Joel, the theme over there of God judging not just one nation here or there, but the nations in general God bringing justice to the whole great big mess. And then we get our pivot to the optimistic part, the part that we're always hoping we get at the end of these Old Testament prophets. And so often we do get it. And in this case, the encouraging part is reminiscent of what we get back in Micah chapter four, where remember Micah was using that imagery about there's going to be this mountain, the temple and all of the nations are going to be like, what are we doing? We should go to Jerusalem and learn from them and effectively worship their God. And the prophet Micah says that day is indeed coming. Well, all those people from the nations who are coming their Gentiles. And that's a follow through on God's promise to Abraham back in the day that he would be a great nation that he would be blessed by God, but then all the nations would be blessed by the descendants of Abraham. Now that is starting to come into focus all the more. And the last bit of chapter three is just beautiful. It's one of my favorite parts of all of the Old Testament prophetic books because we get this blissful picture of this utopia where God is dwelling among his people and they're all together. And all the stupid broken stuff is gone kind of like Micah and Isaiah say about like the end of war and we're going to take our weapons of war and we're going to reshape them into things that are productive. It's that kind of image, but we also get imagery like we get from Joel chapter two where there's that talk about God's spirit being among all the people who've come from all the corners of the world and God's spirit is among them like it used to live in the temple like it used to live in the tabernacle in the Ark of the Covenant. Now it lives in people. Well, this is a degree of intimacy and closeness and unbroken fellowship with God that we've only seen very briefly at the very beginning all the way back in the garden. And now we're getting these hints that we can look forward to that again someday in the future. That's exciting. And the further we get into the Old Testament and the more of these indictments from the prophets we see, the more we come to realize that is the only way forward is to be that close and that connected to God to the true King. And so even though Zephaniah predicts what pretty much all the prophets are predicting whether they're predicting the fall of the north or prophesying to the south and predicting the fall of the south. They're all saying there's a judgment coming. It's gone on too long. It's in the fabric that can't be sorted out easily. There's no neat solution. This is going to require judgment. We're too far into the speed wobble. We're going to crash. It's coming quickly. But the idea is that this judgment is not the end game. The judgment is a necessary step in God remaking things to get us closer to the arrival of this King from the line of David who we've been hearing about in other books of the Old Testament. And closer to this new Eden, this new union with God where people from all the nations come together and experience this amazing thing. When you visualize Zephaniah picture that speed wobble where the crash at the end is a foregone conclusion, when you think about the theme reflect on judgment of this moment to clear the way for a new and better one that is to come. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to catch chapter three versus eight through the end of it. And with that, congratulations. That is another level up for you and for me. My five nice job next time around. We got the book of Haggai. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Haggai. When you turn the page, as you're reading straight through the Bible, from Zephaniah to Haggai, there is a mountain of change that occurs. And in order to understand where we are now and get oriented and wrap our heads around what Haggai is talking about, we're going to have to lay a little bit of groundwork here. All of these Old Testament prophets we've been reading up to this point are largely set in one of two eras. That is the mid-700s BC, right at the end of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and all those prophets charge the Northern Kingdom with evil and corruption and wicked leadership and economic injustice, and they all anticipate Assyria coming along and conquering the Northern Kingdom, which happened under Sargon II in 722 BC. Then there's another flurry of Old Testament prophecy we've been looking at that is directed largely at the remaining southern kingdom of Judah that makes the same charges in the late 600s BC about corruption and evil and economic injustice. But these prophets are pointing toward this dark gathering storm on the horizon that is Babylon and they correctly anticipate the destruction of the southern kingdom and the temple where God lives in 586 BC by Nebuchadnezzar of the Babylonians. But then we turn the page over to Haggai and everything looks different. For starters, this layout of the text looks different. It's going to look in your Bible more like the block formatting of Genesis or Exodus, like narrative the way it's presented. Whereas all of the prophets we've been looking at up till this point, mostly it looks like the way Psalms is laid out. It's poetry or at least a poetic structure in the way these prophecies are given. Further, we discover that we've fast forwarded almost a hundred years since what we were looking at with Zephaniah all the way past the era of the Babylonians and into the early era of the Persians. So a whole empire has fallen in between. Babylon is gone, deposed by Cyrus the Great and Persia. And if we go back and look at Ezra and Nehemiah, we can piece things together. Also, we can go back and just look at history books because now we're into the stuff that's really well documented extra biblically. And we can see that Cyrus the Great conquered the Babylonians in 539. And then in 538, he's like, we're not going to rule like the Assyrians and the Babylonians. We're going to let some of these conquered people groups go back, rebuild their home countries and have a degree of self-governance still subject to Persia. Of course, that mixed with violent expansion is how Cyrus built up the Persian Empire so quickly. Cyrus just couldn't get enough of conquering things. And he died at the hands of a warrior queen in the far north. And that created a little bit of a succession crisis in early Persia. His son, Cambyses, was given the kingdom. He had military success in Egypt, but then he dies as a young man, getting on his horse and scraping himself with his own weapon. And his kid brother in the east is about to find out and no doubt claim power. But there's an opportunity right here and Cambyses Lancebearer, the guy who's in charge of making sure he doesn't get stabbed with his own weapons, a young man named Darius along with a few other guys are like, we got to take control of the situation. We have to pounce now. So they ride hard from the far west all the way across the kingdom back to the Persian homeland and they catch Bardiah and they assassinate him. Well, they come out and tell the world it wasn't Bardiah at all. It was a magician impersonating Bardiah and we purged the kingdom for all of you citizens of this evil usurper. And it is with a heavy heart that I Darius will become the new king. Now, while all of this stuff is going on, the Jewish exiles have returned under the leadership of a couple of guys named Zerubable, a descendant of David who would be king if there were still a kingdom and a high priest named Joshua and they've been chipping away at rebuilding the temple. That's a little bit of a bomber so far because they can't afford a great big giant temple. The footprint is going to be smaller and there's been opposition and they've lost momentum. In fact, the building is completely stalled out during the age of Cambyses and the early age of Darius. But very quickly through a Persian official, the Jews send an appeal back to Darius and they're like, hey, we were commissioned by Cyrus to do this. It's funded and Darius is like, all right, let me rummage through the records. Yep, sure enough, there it is. Darius is very politically motivated to make sure that all edicts of previous kings are honored and in 520, he gives the Jews permission to start building again. This is where things get weird and this is where Haggai comes in and is so necessary in this exact moment in history. And I think it's so important to note that in Haggai, we get specific dates for when all of Haggai's prophecy occurs. In fact, I'll just tell you the first one happened on August 20th, 520, the second one September 1st, 520, the third one October 17th, 520, and then he had two in the same day, maybe one over breakfast and one over dinner on December 18th, 520. This is the first place in the Bible where we get unbelievable date specificity and it makes so much sense because we also have unbelievable date specificity as to what's going on in the larger world. And when we compare the two, we understand Haggai's urgent call to get crack and on rebuilding the temple. He does not view this rebuilding project as a foregone conclusion. Rather, he views it as something that needs to be happening right, right now. Why Darius's claim to the throne was weak. There were people who liked the family of Cyrus and they rebelled. There were other parts of the Persian Empire on the far fringes who were like, eh, without Cyrus and his family. I don't think this Persia thing is going to hold up. We're just going to go back to governing ourselves. So Darius in the fall of 520 is preparing for a massive campaign of re-assimilation that he goes on starting in early 519. And there's no guarantee he's going to win. Well, the only reason the temple is being funded and rebuilt is because Darius feels pressure to uphold the edicts of previous kings. If Darius dies, if Darius's control of the region shrinks, if his campaign to re-assimilate everyone and firm up his control over things drains the treasury enough, then he might not want to fund this thing anymore. And so Haggai is going, let's get crack and read the room guys. So his whole play is to shake everybody out of complacency. Haggai's message is pretty straightforward. On August 2520, he looks at what's going on. He's like, why are you guys building cool, fancy, paneled houses, maybe in the style of Persia for yourselves while God is still homeless? He seems to be in toning. If you get the building order wrong, if you come at this the wrong way, it undermines the effectiveness and the purity of the temple that you're eventually, I guess, planning to get around to build. No, you need to be taking care of God's house first. And by September 21st, under the leadership of Zorubable, that is happening. Things are moving in the midst of all of that. Haggai is communicating that God's spirit remains in your midst. God is with you. He doesn't live in that temple anymore right now, but like the imagery we've seen in some of the other minor prophets, he's dwelling among you and he is behind this thing. I mean, specifically the language is saying work for I am with you. And we've heard God say stuff like this before, like back in Exodus, we get this kind of language while God's people are in the shadow of another giant empire. We get this kind of language sometimes when God's people go into battle during the era of the conquest, even sometimes in the age of the kings. So this is a massively encouraging word from Haggai to say, hey, it might not look like the glory of the last temple, but Haggai goes on to say the glory of this thing somehow is going to exceed that of the previous temple. And God is already in our midst. And as an additional encouragement, we see Haggai drawing on the same imagery that we get in Isaiah and in Micah chapter four about all the nations coming to worship. At this building that they are building right now, he says in verse seven of chapter two, and I will shake all nations so that the treasures of all nations shall come in and I will fill this house with glory says the Lord of hosts. So there's an urgency here that goes beyond the momentary political unpredictability that Darius and the larger kingdom is going through here. There's an urgency because the Haggai is reminding them this is to be a blessing to the nations. This is not a regional deity being appeased by his regional ethnic followers. This is an act of service to all of humanity that you guys are doing. You are playing a role in the grand story of redemption for everybody. So make it happen. Then finally on December 18th, 520, Haggai speaks again a couple of times. And one of those, he reiterates the idea that you need to do this right and with purity and pure hearts so that what you are building will be built on a foundation of doing things right with purity and pure hearts. And then he goes on to talk about that idea of the day of the Lord again, like what we saw in Joel, this concept that the nations are going to be judged. That's a follow up on all this stuff that the prophets back in the age of the northern kingdom, the southern kingdom were saying. And finally, he says to the rubable in so many words that there's going to be a restoration of David's royal line. And of course he's saying that to the rubable because the rubable is a part of David's royal line. I love the way extra biblical history and the stuff that we see Haggai saying overlap and intertwine so neatly. It just makes the book that much more understandable. But I also love the fact that Haggai is very optimistic about the role that people play in the unfolding of God's plan and the fact that God is ordained that people get to take part in this and that it actually matters. When you visualize the book of Haggai, picture those paneled houses and everybody was building because they were so eager to have a fancy house and a gotten board of building a house for God. When you think about the theme, reflect on restoring God's dwelling place as a part of the grand story of redemption. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, which you probably do have time to read the whole thing, it goes pretty quick, at least make sure to check out chapter 1, verse 13 and chapter 2, verses 20 through the end of the chapter. This was a tough one for me. There was so much more stuff that I wanted to do and that I wanted to get into with the Persia business. If that wedded your appetite and you find that stuff fascinating as well, please plan to stick with me when we get done with this series because we are going to deep dive into the book of Esther and all of this Persia, exile, historical stuff. And I think it's going to be a ton of fun. That's coming up. Wow, really in just a few weeks at this point. There we go. We have unlocked the Haggai achievement and we've got one of the granddaddies of Old Testament prophecy next, Zechariah, which is just wonderful. Can't wait. I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Zechariah. There's almost 30 people in the Old Testament named Zechariah, and the name means God remembers or Yahweh remembers. And so when you think about that, it makes perfect sense that there'd be so many people who would have that name because the memory of God is such a prominent theme as you read through the Old Testament. God remembers the screwed up stuff that the nations do, and it might seem like there's no justice for that, but God remembers, and he's going to straighten up accounts with them. He's going to bring justice and judgment on those perpetrators of evil. But also he remembers the lowly and the oppressed, and the people who've been through so much, and he remembers his own people and is covenant with his own people again, even when it seems like it's been a while, and maybe he's forgotten. No, that's not the case. God remembers. And so it makes perfect sense to me that in this Old Testament prophetic book of Zechariah, we would have a guy whose name means God remembers because he's talking to a bunch of people who aren't sure whether or not God remembers. This Zechariah the prophet is working between 520 and 518 BC, and he is a part of this group of exiled Jews and Persia who'd been taken there by the Babylonians who were released by Cyrus the Great to go back and rebuild the temple. But then they run into some opposition, some pretty serious bureaucratic hang-ups, and the work grinds to a halt, and we learn from Zechariah 4-10, the people get into the state of malaise, and they start worrying about building their own houses. And just in general, come to think that this is not a significant time, meaningful things just aren't happening right now. That is the situation into which Haggai and Zechariah are speaking. Here's roughly the timeline of how all this goes down. In August of 520, just shortly after Darius, the king of the Persians, has reiterated Cyrus's decree that the temple should be rebuilt and funded everything, nothing is happening. And so Haggai comes along and is like, hey, you guys got to quit building your own personal, fancy, paneled houses. That is not only an act of selfishness, it's an act of discouragement and malaise. You're acting like the Lord has forgotten. He has not forgotten. Big-time paraphrase is mine. So over the course of the next month into September, we see Zerubable take heed of that and momentum begins again for building. Then around what would be Halloween-ish. I don't think they actually celebrated that back then, but it gives you context. Zechariah comes along and issues a big general purpose call to repentance. Don't do evil like your forefathers did. Turn away from your wicked ways. Surely he has their flirting with unfaithfulness and their commissioning to finish the temple. In view. And somewhere around December of that year, maybe just a little later, it looks like everybody does repent. They respond to Haggai's message. They respond to Zechariah's message. There is building occurring. And now we're into hopeful mode. Well, that fall prophecy from Zechariah in 520 is one of these traditions. Like the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah and then he said this stuff. But the next chunk of prophecies we see in this book are really different in character and that they are all born out of a dream. Dreams are weird and as a result, these look weird, but God uses dreams all throughout the Bible. Way, way, way back in the super old stuff. He uses it in the New Testament as well. Joseph and with Paul later on, this is normative for God. It's a way that he communicates truth even though the imagery is sometimes pretty strange and foreign looking as we encounter it now. There's probably an upside to that in that sometimes the reason that we get bogged down and can't move forward as humans or as a group of humans is because we lack imagination and we can't even picture or envision anything different than what we've quagmired into. And something as weird looking as these dream sequences we see around the Bible can be the kind of thing that really awaken that imagination and shake you into the pursuit of a new paradigm that's better and more in keeping with what God is about. Make the dream thing whatever you will, but the Bible holds it out as being from God and being very instructive in this message of hope and this reminder that God does indeed remember. Here's a quick sampling of some of the vivid imagery from these dream prophecies of Zechariah. First of all, there are writers, well, there are two sequences that have writers from God charioteers going out and patrolling the whole land and they come back and report. It looks like there's actually kind of peace around the world right now and this begs the question like, okay, well, is this the time then that the full realization of the kingdom is to happen and everything is going to get squared away. That question does not get answered. Then there's another vision with this common Old Testament image of horns like brass instrument but like a horn on an animal is a symbol of power or authority and some of the horns represent defeated nations like Babylon or Syria before them and it looks like Persia are the horns of power that are representative of how those evil empires are getting displaced. Then we get imagery that is kind of reminiscent of Amos in terms of that plum line image that you're measuring to make sure things are square. In this case, we get a picture of Zerubable holding that plum line to consider whether things are all square and right and ready to go, maybe coming back with the same kind of hey, everything's looking better kind of verdict like the horseman did in the earlier vision but also there's somebody who's stretching out a measuring cable more like horizontally to go and measure the circumference, the sheer size of what this city of Jerusalem is going to be and then there's a declaration that God is going to be the walls and defend this city and that imagery points forward to a future day in Jerusalem as well. Then we see the high priest Joshua and he's all covered in dirty, gross, grimy clothes representative of the failure and the sins of the people but then this voice appears and is like, no, dress him up in the fine garments and he gets this new outfit that's shining and beautiful and I think in a way, Jesus parable of the prodigal son toward the end of it in Luke 15 is alluding back to this when the dad gets his dirt, pig, slime, covered kid back and is like, whoa, get all of this yuck off of him. My son was dead and now he's alive again, put this fancy outfit on and we're going to celebrate. It's kind of that same vibe here and it's very much in keeping with that theme. God remembers. He remembers in his mercy. He remembers in his justice. Then we get some imagery that kind of looks like the lamp stands at the beginning of the book of Revelation and the idea here is that this kingdom may be realized soon if the people respond to God's calling in the right way. After that, we get a vision that's kind of reminiscent of when Ezekiel bizarrely ate that scroll at the beginning of his book. We see this big flying scroll that appears and is representative of rightness and justice and how things ought to be. Then we get a very strange image of a couple of how we think of angels, but they're described as women with stork wings carrying another lady who gets shoved in a basket and that lady represents wickedness, maybe the wickedness of the nations and it's taken away from Jerusalem and taken off toward Babylon, whatever is going to relocate that over there. Then we get a concluding image that is again of these writers going out and about and being like, no, in light of all these visions. We've seen it really does look like things are maybe trending toward hope and trending in the right direction. Then we get one more bonus vision of the high priest being crowned with some sort of heavenly crown, not because he's this unique special character, but because he's some sort of foreshadowing of what could be with the king of kings, the promised king who is still to come. Now, at this point, it feels like we're just done with the book. It's uniform. The theme of God remembers is all over the place and it's optimistic. I get it. I have a sense of knowing what we need to do. There's a proper amount of open-endedness, but then the book pivots to this whole second part that really does read very differently, not like necessarily somebody different wrote it differently, but it's a very different kind of prophecy. Well, that makes sense. Given what we've seen in the first part, we saw a tradition. All the word of the Lord came to him prophecy. Then we saw these night vision prophecies. Well, now we're going to get more of that oracle poetic style prophecy that we've become so accustomed to throughout the Old Testament prophets. And here we get language about God's people truly readying themselves for the advent of the kingdom and God accomplishing all the things that he's been promising for so long. Then we get sort of an oracle against the nations that looks like it's a description of maybe Alexander the Great, who would be the guy who topples Persia 100, 200 years. And then after that in the middle of chapter nine, we start getting into the really thick Messiah language. I'm going to read you a little bit of it. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, daughter of Jerusalem. See your king comes to you righteous and having salvation gentle and riding on a donkey on a cult, the full of a donkey. Remember, this is coming right after the description of Alexander the Great. And when he cruised into cities during his great grand march of conquest in the 330s BC, he did not do so on a humble donkey. He came in on a massive war horse. So this is meant to be a point of contrast. And I think it's a very big deal. I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the war horses from Jerusalem and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth. Again, they're getting that language that we saw that was common between Micah and Isaiah about beating swords and to plow shares and the end of war. And so everything is looking great as we get into the last few chapters of Zechariah. But then in chapter 11, this shepherd king, this one who rides in on a donkey who's promised who's going to straighten things out, gets rejected by false shepherds, gets rejected by the leaders of the people. And of course, this is all anticipatory of how Jesus' life and public ministry and ultimate death on the cross all goes down. And indeed, that's probably why Zechariah gets referenced so very much, especially in the third act of the book of Matthew that describes how this unfolded in Jesus' life. Finally, in chapter 14, in spite of this anticipated resistance from these false, lesser shepherd leaders of the people, another one of these days of the Lord kind of things happens in Jerusalem, but this one is special. This is the righting of the wrongs. This is the arrival of the kingdom, the big thing that has been hinted at for so long now as being painted in vivid colors for people to see. And with all of this happening against the backdrop of the rebuilding of the temple during this time of malaise and disappointment and fear among the people that God had not remembered, we really are seeing that Zechariah is a cohesive book beginning to end, specifically dealing in the circumstances of those people's moment on the stage of the grand redemptive story of history, but then expanding its view out to something that is going to flow out of what those people do right there in 520 BC, that is going to play a role in all of this much bigger, more amazing stuff that's going to bless all the nations once again. And the result is just a beautiful, wonderful book that I have found myself listening to for fun on repeat again and again and again during workouts and while I do chores because this really does fill me with hope and remind me that God remembers. When you visualize Zechariah, picture that shepherd king who is to come. When you think about the theme, reflect on Zechariah's name, God remembers. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, check out chapter 9 verses 9 through 10, all of chapter 10 and all of chapter 14. Achievement unlocked, Zechariah, there we go. Next time around, we've got the last book of the Old Testament Malachi. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon."}, {"meta_data": {"duration": "13:26", "episode_num": "BIBLE39", "pub_date": "Fri, 24 Feb 2023 14:00:00 +0000", "subtitle": "Thanks to everyone who supports TMBH at\u00a0 You're the reason we can all do this together!

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Malachi. I watched a movie not too long ago where the main characters, the characters who you're rooting for, just keep making the same mistakes again and again. So, the majority of the third act feels like this continuing cycle of, hey, we got free from our captors. Oh no, we made mistakes. Now we're captured again, but we got free again. And it happens so many times and it gets so laughable that eventually whoever made the movie felt like they needed to hang a lantern that is signaled to the audience. They're like, yeah, we see it too. And they actually had one of these characters say, I can't believe we got captured again. And as an audience member, you're like, yeah, well, I'm right with you. That is a lot of making the same mistake over and over again. And likewise, that's kind of how the Old Testament prophetic book Malachi feels. It's the last book of the Old Testament. I don't think Malachi is just dealing with the stuff that is happening historically in the book of Malachi. I think it's also meant to be a look back at the whole Old Testament. It's meant to be an attempt to make sense of this story that we just saw and to think through whether there's any reason to stay tuned for what's going to happen next. We don't know anything about Malachi from anywhere else in the Bible. We don't know exactly when Malachi was written, though I think there are enough clues in the text to indicate that we are probably somewhere around the very end of the lifetime of Nehemiah and Ezra were to a place where the temple has definitely been rebuilt and is active again, but also enough time has elapsed that people are back to not really caring about it. They've sort of had their fill. They kind of got excited back with the stuff that Zechariah was saying about like maybe we're going to have this new advent of this new kingdom like maybe now, but then it looks like a little bit of time passed and they were like, yeah, things didn't happen quickly enough. I don't know. I'm not really into it anymore. And they go back to making the exact same mistakes that they've been making since forever and ever and ever time immemorial. And as a viewer, as a reader, there's an exhaustion that you feel, not with the Bible. The Bible has been awesome, but with the narrative, the plot, a frustration, a heart heaviness that you feel with the main human characters who just can't seem to get out of their own way. Look, I'm not saying I would have done better. I'm a hundred percent positive that I would have been on the side of people who were idiots and did the things that were wrong all the time throughout the Old Testament because I know myself and I tend to be an idiot and do things that don't make sense, even in the face of things that do make sense. So I get it. I have empathy for these people, but just as an objective reader stepping back from a distance, you do feel fatigue at this point. You get to a place where you no longer believe that this is going to get worked out under the parameters of this paradigm. We have tried a relationship between God and his people wandering around out in the desert with God as their sole provider didn't work. They weren't up for it. We've seen an attempted a relationship between God and his people where he's their general, leading them into battle and conquest didn't work. We've seen an attempt at this relationship where God uses judges to govern the people and give some all kinds of leeway. Yeah, that really didn't work. Then we've seen kings of a unified kingdom that didn't work. Then we tried out a relationship between God and people using separated kingdoms with two different sacrificial systems and two different sets of kings. Yeah, that didn't work. Then we tried a relationship between God and his people where there's the specter of destruction always looming. Will this make them faithful? No, that's not going to work either. Okay, well, now let's try a relationship between God and his people where they're conquered and they don't have kings anymore. And now they live as subjects in exile. Now, that didn't really work either. Well, okay. Now let's see what it looks like when we have God and his people come back from exile and rebuild things and govern themselves and have a new temple and a fresh chance. But now they've learned all the lessons of the past. No, no, apparently what we're getting from Malachi and indeed even Haggai and Zechariah is now that that's not going to work either. There's just something fundamentally broken and wrong with humanity with the human heart that stain of sin and Ick is just too deep sunk into the pores and humans can't seem to hold up their end of the bargain. I don't think you can uniquely single out the Jews for this. I mean, noble effort, Jewish people of the Old Testament. You got called and honored and upheld by God, but you behaved like people behave. And so it just didn't work out. Again, I keep coming back to that concept of fatigue and repetition that the reader feels at the end of all of this, but that all the more so the prophet seems to feel that being Malachi and even all the more so God seems to feel. So why did he do all of this? Why did he let these cycles play out that way? Well, it looks like he let him play out enough times that really everybody would have to admit. Yeah, we really tried that. We definitely gave this paradigm a shot to see if we could have union between God and people and people can't hold up their end of the deal. Well, but the people are going down without a fight. And in the book of Malachi, we see a series of disputations of arguments between God and his chosen people in Jerusalem as he expresses what he has not liked about what they have done. And as they kind of defiantly fire back and like, well, where the heck were you? What the heck are you doing? And they accuse God of things. Malachi has the briefest boringest, least detailed introduction to a prophet, I think in the entire Old Testament. It goes like this, the oracle of the word of the Lord of Israel by Malachi. Yeah, that's it. No getting his lips touched by hot coals, no angels with bunch of eyeballs and stuff, no eating, flying scrolls. Just this is the prophet and this is what happened. And ever exactly on the timeline that occurs, what we discover is we go through these disputations, these arguments between God and his chosen people is that the temple system is very much reestablished and God's people are taking it for granted and not particularly interested anymore. Now, this is not the first time that we've seen this disputation between God and people kind of format. We especially see it in Job and then again in Habakkuk. And over the course of these disputations, God's chosen people say, you never totally loved us. You weren't here for us. They accuse him of not punishing people who live wickedly hard enough, letting them continue to thrive and exist. They say his justice hasn't come quickly enough. They haven't seen it presently enough. And along the way, God accuses them of not caring about the temple and not upholding this place that represents the thin spot between them as humans and God is the divine being. He says, you bring the worst stuff from your possessions, from your flocks as sacrifices. You're just going through the motions. You don't give what you're supposed to give per the terms of stuff from back in Leviticus in terms of supporting the temple. That is, they don't tithe anymore. And I don't want to summarize the whole thing as a stalemate between the two parties because it's not the people look bad and God looks good. And there's another call to faithfulness that's present in this entire disputation section of the book. But it does sort of feel like an impasse. Like God could say this a billion more times and things have deteriorated so much on the side of the people in the relationship that not only are they not keeping the covenant anymore, they've become defensive and cynical and unrepentant. And it just looks like this is not going anywhere. Like if the solutions to the problem of humanity that have been evident through the whole Old Testament are going to come to pass, it's not going to come to pass through this relationship in the state that it currently is in. So in light of that toward the end of the book, God says there's going to be this one who shows up and I'm using New Testament language here because I think it's pretty clearly talking about John the Baptist, but there's going to be this one who shows up and points the way toward the new paradigm, the fulfillment of this existing paradigm that demonstrates the inability of humanity to solve their problems or get out of their own way and that points to God bending over backwards even further and going so far above and beyond with this character that we've been hearing about, this promised Messiah who is to come that he's going to bend over backwards in ways that nobody could fully appreciate or anticipate through this coming Messiah. And I'm filling in a few blanks there from some other books we've looked at very recently in the Old Testament in terms of the messaging of this one who is to come, but it sure looks like this messenger of the Lord is John the Baptist. And indeed in Matthew chapter 11, it looks like Jesus confirms that that is the case. Then at the very end of this series of disputations, God says, all right, well, I'm going to put together a book of remembrance of all of the faithful from all along the way of this convoluted, cyclical, difficult story. And that book of remembrance is reminiscent to me of the stuff that we get in Hebrews chapter 11, where we see that indeed God does remember all of these great people who believed him and trusted him in the passage that some people call the Hall of Faith. But then after this beautiful book of remembrance sequence, the Lord remembers, we get a closing word of judgment and destruction, a promise that Elijah the prophet is somehow going to come back and that there is going to be this great and terrifying day of the Lord that won't be terrifying at all for the people who are faithful to God. And all of chapter four, indeed, all of the book of Malachi concludes on this very open ended note, giving the impression to the reader that there is a lot more to come. This situation is not resolved. There are all kinds of promises that are still outstanding. The Messiah is not here yet. The royal line of David has not been restored. The day of the Lord is described here has not yet occurred. God's business with humanity is not done. God's redemption for humanity is not done. But this paradigm that we've been looking at has been clearly weighed and clearly found wanting. It's begging to be completed, to be fulfilled. It's begging to be made right. But that's what we're going to see happen as we turn the page and we finally meet this one who has been promised to come, this great king. Indeed, the Messiah, the Son of God, God in the flesh who are going to meet some 400 years down the road in the book of Matthew. When you visualize Malachi picture a debate when you think about the theme of Malachi, reflect on Israel's failure as all of humanity has failed, but also look forward to a new redemptive paradigm. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to check out the stuff about the messenger who's going to prepare away from chapter two, verse 17 through chapter three, verse four. I think that's a double level up today for both the book of Malachi and the entire Old Testament. Think about what you just did. That's incredible. If it's had any kind of impact on you like it's had on me, then I think it's probably been really fruitful because this trip through the Old Testament that I am wrapping up right now right here with you at this microphone has been maybe the most meaningful impactful time I've ever spent with the Bible and it's been super humbling. I kind of thought I knew this material before I've read it a lot. I went to school for this a whole bunch. I did not know this material and by merit, if you being there and caring about this too, you have forced me to fill my days and nights and time with Old Testament scriptures that I have not thought deeply about in forever. I have learned so much and cannot wait to just flip back to the beginning and do the whole thing again for myself. This text says the word of the Lord does not return void and so whether your person is really into this document or somebody who isn't really sure what to make of God or maybe isn't sure that there even is a God at all or maybe you're somebody who used to be sure of that and then weird things happen in your faith or in church, you get your heart broken and you're still here anyway. Whoever you are looking at this, the God who is held out as being behind this book says that his word does not return void and you and I just ingested a bunch of it together and I think this is going to change our lives in some way and I can't wait to see what the New Testament has in store for us. I really do appreciate you. Thanks for doing this. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. See you for Matthew next time around.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Matthew. This is the most excited I've been for an episode that we've done so far together as we're going through the Bible one book per day until we're done. The book of Matthew is not only my favorite book of the Bible, it is my favorite book of everything. It's my favorite thing that's ever been written by anyone. And first and foremost, the reason for that is not just because I'm named after the guy who wrote it, that probably factors a little. But first and foremost, the biggest reason is because this is where I met Jesus of Nazareth. This is the first account I ever heard of who he was or what he's about, what he did, his life, his death, his resurrection, all of that stuff. And I'm a Christian. So as much as I like to come at the Bible academically and historically, I love narrative structure, all of that stuff is really important and exciting to me. Nothing in the Bible is more important or exciting to me than the main character of the Bible. Jesus of Nazareth, I think he's got in the flesh. I think he is the completion and the answer to everything that gets set up in the Old Testament. And so when I set out to do something like this, I'm just straight up excited because we finally get to talk directly about Jesus of Nazareth on screen here in the Book of Matthew. And as I keep hinting at here, I don't think I'm going to do it justice because I just did 800 episodes on it and I don't feel like that was even enough time to plumb all of the depths of the awesomeness of this book. So I'm just amped and I'm excited to talk to you about this first book of the New Testament, the Book of Matthew. And the New Testament is a whole new chunk of Bible. Practitioners of Judaism acknowledge the Old Testament and have for millennia as the Bible. Christians also acknowledge the Old Testament as the Bible. In fact, there are even some Parachristian religions that would also acknowledge the Old Testament in one way or another as the Bible. But here we come to a fork in the road because practitioners of historical Judaism do not view the New Testament as Bible. And the big dividing point here is the main character. It's Jesus of Nazareth. Christians look at that and say, that guy right there is the continuation, the completion, the fulfillment of all of the stories and all of the laws and all of the poetry and all of the wisdom and all of the ups and downs of the narrative and all of the prophecy, subtle and overt of the entire Old Testament. It all points to him. So for those of us who believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the promised King who is to reign on the throne of David, the realization of that glimmer of hope that we see wedged into all the little cracks between downers and calamities throughout the whole story of the Old Testament, we think Jesus is that guy. And so the New Testament is just a continuation of the Old Testament. All the themes follow through all the payoffs are there. Same God, same religion. This is the exact same thing rolling on into history. Well, there are some people who don't see it that way and are still looking for that promised King, that promised Messiah to come. And that is the genesis of that historical distinction. Well, Matthew's the first book, not only of the New Testament, but Matthew is also the first book of the first section of the New Testament, which we refer to collectively as the Gospels. It's these four parallel accounts that all tell the story of Jesus of Nazareth. His miracles, his life, his teaching, his death, his resurrection, what happened after he rose from the grave. But Matthew is not just an interchangeable part with these other three accounts of the life of Jesus called the Gospels. He's doing something truly unique. Matthew is writing to the Jews. He is a Jewish guy. Now he sold out his own people to go inside with the Romans and collect taxes from his Jewish brothers and sisters, but that kind of gets worked out in the course of the book that he's written here. Matthew's big interest is in showing that the story of Jesus is in complete continuity with the Old Testament, that it's the fulfillment and the completion of everything we've seen up to this point, and that Jesus is indeed that promised King that we've all been waiting for for all of these ugly cycles of history to finally be broken for the human problem to finally be addressed and for this new family of faith to get created that is bigger than just the Jewish people, but certainly includes them, wherein all of the nations start to come and learn about how to worship God and learn who God is. All of that stuff, Matthew is really emphasizing and pointing out here. Also, Matthew puts more emphasis on the words of Jesus than any of these other Gospels. Now these four Gospels, they're all narrative, but they're all narrative that have a lot of conversation and speeches woven into them, particularly from Jesus. But most of all, Matthew does that. Over half of the total word count, nearly 60% of the total word count of the book of Matthew is just Jesus talking. That's more than any of the other three Gospels. In fact, Matthew is structured his whole book around five big speeches that Jesus gives. And these five speeches walk you right through the obvious list of questions that the original audience, a bunch of Jewish people have been waiting a long time for this Messiah to show up and they're starting to get a little discouraged and impatient would be asking. Matthew references tons of Bible. Over 50 times, he explicitly quotes from the Old Testament and he alludes to or references the Old Testament far more even than that. Matthew's book is absolutely steeped in what we just got done looking at. And that's probably the reason that chapter one opens with a genealogy. And if you just read and straight through the Bible, you might get to this point and be like, are you kidding me? Another list of names? Why does this matter so much? Well, it matters because each of those names on that list, one is meant to remind a Jewish audience member or somebody who's recently gone through the Old Testament of all kinds of the stories that demonstrate how God has remembered and been faithful and also how his people have bumbled and have been unable to hold up their end of the bargain. And that's not a Jewish problem. That's an everybody problem. The Old Testament paints a crystal clear picture of the brokenness of humanity and our inability to fix the human condition. We clearly are going to need God to introduce a new paradigm in order to bring about redemption because we tried all the other paradigms and they didn't work. So going through this list of names, one reminds us of the themes and the setup for the whole story and what is left to be completed. But two, going through these names right at the beginning is very important to Matthew's original audience because they don't want to hear anything about anybody who's maybe a messiah unless they are demonstrably descended from David. So we cover both of those things with this opening genealogy. And then as we move on from there into the book of Matthew, it might be a little disorienting if you just turn the page from Malachi, because 400 plus years have passed. Persia got beat by Alexander the Great and the Greeks slash Macedonians. Alexander the Great died. His generals divided up the whole world. Those empires gradually faded and one of them got defeated by the Jews who from 164 to 63 BC had their own little individual kingdom for a while, but that failed. It looked like all of the mess from the era of the kings all the way back in the Old Testament. Clearly, nothing has changed. Then along comes his new superpower, Rome. They gradually conquer everyone. And when we get to the time of the birth of Jesus in chapter one of the book of Matthew, we've got this brand new superpower who is the oppressor and occupier of the province of Judea and the province of Galilee. Galilee roughly corresponds to the territory of the old northern kingdom of Israel and Judea roughly corresponds to the old southern kingdom of Judah. Well, now that we've shaken off the historical cobwebs and we're a little bit oriented from there, we get four chapters of prologue about Jesus birth, about these people coming from far away who aren't Jews to worship him. This hints at this new family of faith that's going to be bigger and how all the nations are going to come and worship in Jerusalem. And we see the resistance from the political and religious leadership as Herod tries to kill Jesus. We see Jesus get baptized by John the Baptist who is this promised Elijah that you might remember from the minor prophets who is to come and pave the way. The way is paved. Jesus gets baptized. The father and the Holy Spirit show up at Jesus baptism. The whole Trinity is there affirming that he's the son of God for anybody who's paying attention, but also the religious leaders show up at Jesus baptism and we get a foretaste of the resistance they are going to pose to Jesus throughout this story. They not Rome are going to be his chief enemy. In chapter four, Jesus faces temptation and the wilderness from the devil himself. He passes the test. Nobody's ever passed before. He doesn't sin. And then in chapter five, we get the first of the big five speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured. And this one is about how the kingdom is going to be and not that the kingdom is a replacement of something from before, but that the kingdom and Jesus himself is the fulfillment of everything that came before. And what I think is the key verse of the whole book of Matthew, Matthew 5 17, Jesus says, don't think that I came to destroy the law and the prophets. I didn't come to destroy them, but to fulfill them. And then he goes on to talk about right relationship with God and how you can't do it. Even if you were allowed to make all the rules yourself, you couldn't even keep up those rules. He's in toning that there is a righteousness apart from our behavior, apart from the Old Testament law. And this is a righteousness from God. And that is how access to this new family of faith is going to be achieved. It's going to transcend ethnicity and in this beautiful kingdom, the values are finally just and right side up and all of that oppression and Ick that we read about in the Old Testament, it gets sorted out. Well then coming off of the mountain, people are like, that was a really good speech. I wonder if he can back it up because he taught with authority, not like our teachers of the law. And then in chapters eight and nine, Jesus goes on to demonstrate, yeah, he does have the authority to back it up as he does all kinds of miracles, breaking the laws of time and space. In chapter 10, he sends out his disciples with the message that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And so people should repent. And then in chapters 11 and 12, we start to see resistance to this as the religious leaders recognize, whoa, this is getting momentum and this is not how we're picturing a messiah and this is a huge threat to the authority niche. We've carved out here. We got to do something about Jesus. So they start trying to trick him and trap him, but it doesn't work. He's Jesus. He's too smart. He's going to break the laws of time and space, which is a huge advantage for him. So now we've got that sermon on the Mount, which is the first great big speech, chapters five through seven. We've got Jesus missional discourse in chapter 10, where he sends out all the disciples and equips them to do so. That's the second big speech. Now the third big speech happens in chapter 13, where Jesus teaches in parables in such a way that it's going to make sense to everybody who's already in on this kingdom thing. It might make sense to people who are from the squishy middle and not quite sure what to make of them. And these parables about how the development of the kingdom is going to unfold. They're not going to make any sense to the people who don't like Jesus and reject him. Well coming off of that, we see the pressure ratchet up even more. John the Baptist gets killed by Herod, yet Jesus is still compassionate despite the fact that he's feeling the pressure. He feeds the five thousand. He feeds the four thousand miraculously. And in chapter 16, finally, the question is absolutely pregnant. Are you actually the Messiah? And Peter is the one who steps up and is like, yeah, you are the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God. And Jesus says, yeah, you're right. And that's from God, not from you. And Jesus chases that revelation by saying, not only is that true, but also I'm going to die at the hands of the religious leaders and be raised on the third day. And that sets the trajectory for the rest of the book. In chapter 18, Jesus gives his fourth big speech around which the book of Matthew is structured, he explains what life is going to be like in the church in this new representation of his family of faith. And then Jesus makes his way to Jerusalem where he's received enthusiastically by the masses, but the leaders put him through the paces. It's kind of like the test that the devil gave him in chapter four. But now it's the religious leaders and he handles every test. They throw at him with no problem whatsoever. And ultimately it becomes clear. Indeed, they're going to kill him before that happens. This gives his fifth big speech around which the book of Matthew is structured. And this one is about how the kingdom is going to unfold in the future and over time. And he tells his disciples, you're not going to get to know all the details of this. But here's how to live in light of the fact that this is still unfolding and that God will see through this redemptive plan to completion. Then Jesus gets rested and tried before the religious leaders and before the Roman governor ponches pilot. Pilot is the one who ultimately pulls the trigger on Jesus execution. Jesus is executed on a cross as he predicted all of the disciples scatter and a bunch of unlikely followers go and take care of Jesus body. But then three days later in front of a whole bunch of witnesses, he comes back to life. Just like he said, Jesus goes to his disciples, restores them and commissions them in the closing verses of the book saying all authority on heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you. And surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age. And that's the end of the book. The reader, whether a Jewish person hearing this read aloud in the first century A.D. just a few decades after all of this happened or the person reading it right now on their tablet while writing on the subway in an English translation in North America. Either way, Matthew's throwing down the gauntlet and he's like, this right here, Jesus, I'm telling you, this is the guy. This is the solution to the human problem and this family of faith. Whoever you are, wherever you're hearing these words, it's open to you. Matthew is a book that is meant to be responded to when you picture the book of Matthew, visualize the crown of thorns that was placed on his head at the crucifixion. When you think about the theme, reflect on Jesus as the long promised king who has finally arrived. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to catch chapters five through seven. That's that first big speech, the sermon on the Mount and make sure to catch chapters twenty seven and twenty eight. That's Jesus death and resurrection. This one was a little bit longer, but I had a sneaking suspicion it was going to be and I'm at peace with that. We got Mark tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.

Right now, we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Mark. The Book of Mark is so much like the Book of Matthew on its surface, and that it is telling the story of Jesus from a very sympathetic perspective. Obviously, Mark thinks Jesus is the Son of God. He thinks Jesus is the Savior of the world, and he wants you to believe that. So, at the most basic level, he's trying to accomplish the same thing that Matthew, before him, was trying to accomplish. He wants to get to the end. He's going to wrap the book up pretty abruptly, just as Matthew did. And the idea is, boom, balls in your court, reader. What are you going to do with that? But where Mark is very different is that he seems to be talking to a completely different audience than Matthew is writing to. And as a result, he's pacing his book very differently because the audience he's writing to doesn't seem to be as interested in all the stuff from the Old Testament. In fact, it looks kind of like Mark is assuming his audience isn't very familiar with much of any of that at all. And so the result is that we see a whole lot of stuff that Jesus did and a very fast-paced telling of the story we just got done with in Matthew. And we get it with a lot fewer words from Jesus. In fact, Mark records fewer than half of the total words of Jesus that we get in the book of Matthew. Well, upon closer examination, we figure out that Mark was a guy who worked with the Apostle Paul. He's part of Generation 2 of Christianity. He traveled with the Apostle Paul in the Book of Acts, which we're going to get to here in a little bit. But he had a falling out with Paul. Paul didn't like his work ethic when he was a young man. And so Mark goes on a different journey and he ends up working with some other people in the early years of the church and eventually starts palling around with Peter as a very close relationship with Peter and apparently wrote a bunch of things down that Peter had said again and again. Well, Peter toward the end of his life ends up in Rome, talking to Roman people, probably giving all kinds of sermons and recollections about the life of Jesus and all these insane, crazy world-changing things that happened during these three big years of Jesus' public life. And we learn from the earliest extra-biblical sources that Mark wrote that stuff down and carefully organized it into a book that would make the whole Jesus thing make sense, not to Jews like what Matthew was doing, but to Romans. So as a result, Mark doesn't give us all the Old Testament stuff. He doesn't give us nearly as many quotes or references to the Old Testament as Matthew does. And when he does give us those, they're a little more veiled. They're like Easter eggs that if part of his Roman audience figured out that Jesus was awesome and then dug deeper into it, they would catch those Easter eggs. So there's no genealogy, there's no birth account. We don't need to know right off the bat that Jesus has descended from David or any of that stuff at all. Instead, the book of Mark opens with the throw down the gauntlet thesis statement right out of the gate that goes like this. First one of chapter one of Mark, the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Well, think about how that's going to sound to a Roman audience. They have tons of gods. So just the fact that God is singular and exclusive here is a bold truth claim in the face of the Roman cosmology, the Roman pantheon of gods, but then also to say that somebody that just like respectfully you Romans and your government had executed. He is the son of God and therefore kind of implicitly what Mark is saying in this opening line is like your government doesn't always get it right and their judgment was incorrect on this one. But here's an opportunity for you, Roman citizen, to take a look at this for yourself and perhaps arrive at a different and better conclusion. And then Mark, knowing the Roman cultural appreciation for sooth saying and prophecy gives his audience a very quick reference to a prophet they've probably never heard of a guy named Isaiah who suggests that there is going to be one who will come and prepare the way. That's John the Baptist and then we're off and running with all of these stories through the first eight chapters that demonstrate Jesus incredible power and it presents him as kind of this man of few words who all of this activity and controversy and difficulty and even spiritual evil is swirling around. But Jesus steps into the fray says what needs to be said and has the power to do what needs to be done and then get on to the next thing. And what is the next thing? Well, if we look at everything, Mark's recording and how he presents it, the next thing is always serving. It's serving God. It's serving men. It's serving women. That would have got people's attention. It's serving Jewish people. Well, you know, obviously you could do that, but it's also serving outsiders, Romans, Gentiles. And through eight chapters, Mark paints this elaborate picture of a servant king. Now that would not have been as familiar to Roman sensibilities. And by the time we get to that pivot point in the middle of the book in chapter eight, it's pretty apparent Jesus is awfully special and the way Mark presents it at this point in the story, it's not particularly difficult for Peter to be like, you are the Messiah. You're the Christ. You're the Son of God. Jesus implicitly affirms that. And then just like in the book of Matthew, he chases it by saying, Yep, and I'm going to die and be raised again on the third day. Now, everything up to this point in the story has happened way up north in the area associated with the Old Testament Kingdom of Israel, the northern kingdom. But now here in the middle of the book, we're making our way down towards Jerusalem where things are no doubt going to get a lot hotter. And as the temperature is getting turned up in this transitional period in the middle of the book, the disciples are wanting to understand exactly how this is all going to work. And Jesus wants them to understand it too, but they're not getting it. And it becomes really clear that they don't understand how Jesus can be this servant king and what the implications are for what it means for them to imitate him in that and follow him. And as we read the rest of the way through the book of Mark, we discover they're not really going to wrap their brains around that until everything has come to pass. And when he gets to Jerusalem, sure enough, the temperature is through the roof. Jesus enemies, that being the religious teachers, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, they come at Jesus with everything they got once he gets to Jerusalem. And sadly, when those religious leaders realize that Jesus does look a lot like that promised servant prophesied from days of your, they become all the more determined to kill him. But not before Jesus has time to institute the last supper and to explain to his disciples in broad strokes what the unfolding of his kingdom is going to look like and how in the time between then and its full visible realization to everybody. If Mark's Roman audience at this point was becoming sympathetic to Jesus, they're going to cringe at what happens here at the end as it's their government who pronounces a sentence of death on Jesus and carries it out. But Mark's Roman audience is going to feel the same thrill of relief and excitement and confusion as to what this means next for them when Jesus as predicted comes back from the grave. Now this book ends weird. It has an addendum at the end that was clearly added by later scribes and that's going to be noted in all of your Bibles. The Christians aren't shy about that reality, but it looks like Mark ended his book and its original form, at least by his recording Jesus resurrection. And then there's some women who followed him who were there and they see it and they run away because the implications of this are too overwhelming and that's the end of the book. And so you as the reader are left to ponder this thing that changes everything as well. The women are considering what will we do with this reality of Jesus defeated death. This changes everything about existence and our understanding of God and what this means for how we live and what we do with the rest of our lives. And indeed, whether you're a Roman reader way back in the day or reading it for the first time this week, either way, the question is meant for you. What will you do with this? We know who Jesus is from the first half of the book. He's the son of God. He's the Messiah and we know what he's done to change the world and to save like a servant. He went to the cross voluntarily and was raised back to life. And like those ladies realized that has certain implications that transcend time. It looks like Mark paced this understanding that the attention span for an outsider to any of this larger story of the Bible would be a little bit smaller. He keeps the action moving, but all of it is still driving toward a clear conclusion. He's making the case that to follow this servant Jesus who died on the cross and was raised is what it is to be in the kingdom of God to be a citizen of that kingdom. And in all of that, Mark presents everybody, but Jesus as wrestling with the enormity of that claim all the way through the book, all the way up to the very end. So if you're reading this and it's a little bit difficult, you're in good company with everybody here. When you visualize the book of Mark picture the cross that the servant voluntarily went to and died upon. When you think about the theme, obviously reflect on the idea of Christ, the servant. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to at least catch Mark 10 35 through 45 where Jesus really nails the theme of him as that servant. And then I'm going to ask you to go back and read some stuff in Isaiah. There are four songs back there that predict this servant thing. And if the book of Mark wasn't in the Bible, I'm not sure those predictions about Jesus would be explicitly paid off when you go back and read them and I'll mout your brain because they're beautiful. And they do point so clearly to Jesus, especially as presented in Mark, that's Isaiah 42, one through nine, Isaiah, forty nine, one through thirteen, Isaiah, fifty four through eleven and Isaiah 52, thirteen through the next chapter, fifty three and verse twelve. I'll try to remember to put all of that down there in the show notes as well. So it's easy to look up next time around. We're going to turn the page and start the story over again from a fresh perspective with the gospel of Luke. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Luke. It's crazy that Luke contributed as much to the New Testament as he did. He wrote two huge books. One of them is the Gospel of Luke that we're talking about today. It's the third of the four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And then he wrote a sequel to that book called Acts, which is the fifth book in the New Testament. And it's the history of what happened with the early church. But not only did Luke write these two huge books, but also he contributed by word count more to the New Testament than anybody else. I would have guessed it was Paul before I found out that little fact. But no, it's Luke, north of 25% of the New Testament comes from Luke. And the reason that's crazy, well, there are a lot of reasons. Maybe the number one reason that doesn't seem to make sense on paper is that Luke is a Gentile. He's the only Gentile contributor to this whole thing. And that really stands out because this has been a very Jewish affair to this point. Jesus is Jewish. It's all happening in Galilee, in Judea, in Jerusalem. All of the disciples are Jewish. But Luke, he's from somewhere up north. He's not a prophet. He's not trained theologically, at least not in any formal way, like, say, Paul or some others. He's not a professional historian. Either he's a doctor. And so both by ethnicity and profession is just pretty wild that he ended up doing as much Bible writing as he ended up doing. Also, it's kind of awesome that he's both of those things. One, the Gentile thing is awesome because it undergirds the theological theme of the Bible that this always was for the Jews and for the Gentiles. But the second reason that I think who Luke is is pretty awesome considering his role is the way his mind is wired. He's a man of science. He's a man of detail. Luke says at the beginning of his gospel and then at the beginning of its sequel, the Book of Acts, that he set out to write an ordered account of all of these things and that he was going to go and do actual interviews, or that he did go and do these actual interviews with actual people, talked with eyewitnesses to piece the whole thing together. Now Matthew leaned very heavily on the words of Jesus and of the Old Testament to try to convince his Jewish brothers and sisters that Jesus was the long-promised king. And I think he did an excellent job. Mark leaned very heavily on the actions of Jesus to try to convince his Roman friends that Jesus was indeed the Messiah. And now Luke is going to lean very heavily into the clinical details of all of this stuff to try to convince a larger Gentile audience, maybe a Greek-minded audience, of the same thing Luke had become convinced of. That Jesus of Nazareth was innocent of the charges against him that led to his execution, that he is indeed the Messiah and that he's the fulfillment of everything in history, including the Old Testament. Luke is convinced this is for everyone, but clearly he also believed that it needed to be relayed in a certain way to make it make sense to a portion of the audience that he was sympathetic to who might not track with that more heavily Roman perspective or that more heavily Jewish perspective of the Gospels that might have already been floating around out there. Well after Luke goes around and does all this research and gathers all these interviews, he decides that the best way to organize the story of Jesus is to divide it into three geographic scenes with a little prologue on the beginning about the birth of Jesus. The first scene, which is the first roughly third of the book happens all up north and the relatively safe confines of Galilee, then the middle scene is all transitional as we go from way up north to down south in Jerusalem, which is where the third scene happens. So it's kind of a three-act road trip story with massively important events happening all along the way. But that birth prologue on the front end is probably the most famous and memorable thing that we get from the Book of Luke, just as a function of how often we hear it because of Christmas. That nativity story that we're all so familiar with, it comes from Luke with a degree of detail that we don't get in the other Gospels. And in that opening prologue, we learn about two miraculous births. One is that promised forerunner of Jesus, this Elijah who is to come. This is John the Baptist. It's the cousin of Jesus and the son of a guy named Zechariah and a lady named Elizabeth. And then obviously the second birth is the miraculous virgin birth of Jesus of Nazareth himself, this king who was promised. And in the opening prologue, which is a couple chapters long, we get four beautiful poems or songs that lean super heavily. And that old testament language that you and I just spent so much time looking at about who this king will be and what this king will accomplish and how people respond to this king. And the beautiful stuff that is to come out of it, maybe the most famous of those songs is toward the end of chapter one. It's often nicknamed the Magnificat and that comes from Mary, Jesus' mother. And she says, my soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior. For he's been mindful of the humble state of his servant from now on all generations will call me blessed. For the mighty one has done great things for me. Holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him from generation to generation. He's performed mighty deeds with his army, scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He's brought down rulers from their thrones, but has lifted up the humble. He's filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he has said to our fathers. That is so theologically significant as connective tissue between everything about the old story and everything that's about to happen now. Remember, Luke thinks Jesus is the fulfillment of everything that's come before. And by latching onto this language from Mary, he has the reader anticipating just how Jesus is going to be the fulfillment of all of this stuff. In Luke chapter four, Jesus is in a synagogue. He opens up a scroll and reads from the prophet Isaiah. He reads the following words there. He says, the spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. And he rolls up the scroll and he says, today, this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing. He's not being shy about who he is and what he's there to do, especially emphasizing that justice theme that we see throughout all the prophecies in the Old Testament about what the Messiah is going to do. He's going to straighten out the stuff that's upside down and weird and wrecked and stupid. And Jesus doesn't shy away from that aspect of things. And he certainly doesn't shy away from letting people rightly recognize that, no, he's in so many words, more explicitly all the time demonstrating himself to be the Messiah. Well, just like in Matthew and Mark, some people like it. Some people don't know what to make of it. And some people are very, very angry. Much like in Matthew, Jesus has a big block of teaching while he's still up north. And in that he lays out the values of his kingdom. And this kingdom is one where justice happens. And it's not a worldly notion of justice. The values are upside down. It's the opposite of how the world thinks about things. And this is very compelling to the people up north. And probably, given what we see in the first nine chapters of Luke, he could have just stayed up there and made a gigantic movement. Maybe even got people to get swords and stuff and kill some Romans or overthrow something. But he doesn't. He insists on turning his face resolutely toward Jerusalem and going to face down what needs to happen there. Now, just like in Mark and in Matthew, there's a moment where the disciples realize that he is indeed the Messiah. And just like in Matthew and Mark, Jesus chases that by saying, I am going to go die in Jerusalem at the hands of the chief of God. The hands of the chief priests, the teachers of the law, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the religious leaders. And then I'm going to be raised back to life by my father on the third day. This is what has to happen. And so it's a pretty dramatic moment when Jesus then turns his face resolutely toward Jerusalem and starts in that direction. So the way Luke has it structured now, there's this calamity on the other end of this road trip. And you can tell this is a one way ticket, but along the way, Jesus meets so many people and he's eating with people who like him and he has these dramatic confrontations. And he tells amazing stories, including the stuff in chapter 15, where Jesus is eating food with tax collectors and social outcasts and the Pharisees are there as well, complaining about it. I mean, what a wild room that must have been. And Jesus starts talking. And he tells this story about this lost sheep and this good shepherd who leaves all the other ones behind to go and find the one who is lost. This is very central to how Jesus is presented in Luke as the one who comes to seek and save the lost. But then that theme of lost and found continues throughout this moment in Luke 15, where he goes on to talk about a lost coin being found, but most famously of all, a lost son being found. And the warm reception that the father who the son betrayed and insulted, the warm reception that that father gives him. It's really one of the most beautiful stirring images and stories in the entire Bible. Well, by the end of chapter 19, Jesus has made his way to Jerusalem. It's a very emotional thing for the people who receive him, but it's emotional for him as well. He knows why he's there. He knows that Jerusalem is rejecting him and he knows that his people have rejected God time and time again. And now they're about to engage in the ultimate rejection of the will of God and the work of God. As it is in Matthew and Mark, Jesus lays out for his disciples in broad strokes how things are going to unfold for the realization of the kingdom moving forward into history. And then after that, Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper is arrested and Luke really goes out of his way to point out the shenanigans that went on in getting this conviction. The actual authority figures, they just don't see Jesus guilt, but the religious leaders are like, no, he is guilty. We will accept nothing other than his execution. And Jesus ends up going to the cross. And Luke gives us a couple of those memorable stories from the cross where Jesus is actively verbally forgiving the people and asking God to forgive the people who are murdering him unjustly. And Jesus is there on the cross between two criminals and even in all that pain thinks of the one who reaches out to him and assures the guy that today that criminal will be with Jesus in paradise. In the closing chapter of Luke, we get the victory over death. Jesus is raised from the dead, but we get way more detail about it than Mark gives us where Mark seems to cut the story off early to leave some ambiguity and tension for his Roman audience to consider for themselves. Luke really spells it out. He gives us way more details about Jesus' resurrection and this amazing scene where he meets some of his disciples who are grieving on the road and they don't immediately recognize him because he's back to life. That's kind of confusing and disorienting. But then he opens the eyes of these disciples to the scriptures and how Jesus is the fulfillment and the completion of all of that. And then Jesus promises them the arrival of the Holy Spirit and descends into heaven. And that's where the book of Acts, the sequel to Luke, is going to pick up. I love this book. I've read it a bunch of times. It's just my opinion. But I think Luke wildly succeeds in his objectives in trying to give us this ordered account and trying to show us that Jesus was innocent and in trying to show us that he fulfills all of that stuff that came before and is the bringer of justice and straightening things out. Not just to the Jewish people, but to people like Luke, Gentiles, people who God has always had in view. And now that is all coming to fruition. When you visualize the book of Luke, picture that in a tivity scene. When you think about the theme, reflect on the innocent son of man. That's Jesus coming to seek and save the lost. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get Luke 15 like we talked about. Also get Luke 1910 where Jesus spells it out that the son of man came to seek and save the lost. And then also make sure to get that beautiful resurrection passage in all of Luke chapter 24. And with that, we got our Luke achievement unlocked. Last of the gospels, John next time around. A mat.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about John. If we want to make sense of the book of John, I think we have to look back at the last three days of conversations we've had about Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the first three accounts of the life of Jesus, the first three Gospels. And then I think John's book, the fourth Gospel, is going to make more sense. Because I think John wrote his book fully aware that these other three were already done and floating around out there. Because he's doing a very different thing. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are sometimes called the synoptic Gospels. It's a fancy term, but it's pretty easy if you break it down. Sin, like synonym, meaning same, and optic, like optic, meaning eyes, the idea being that they're coming from the same perspective. They're drawing on the same material. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are all the hyper, rightly excited about Jesus. They view him as the completion of everything, and all four of them are trying to get the reader, not just to read an interesting story about an interesting character. They want you to read it and be like, dang, that makes sense to me. And I got to wrestle with what I am going to do in response to the claims about Jesus. But these are also smart, empathetic people, and they understand that the world is big and diverse, and people are diverse, and you got to say it in a way that's going to make sense to different groups of people. So as a result, Matthew writes to Jewish people, and he's trying to convince them that Jesus is the long-promised king, the descendant of David, who is to reign forever. To do that, he speaks their language by drawing on a ton of stuff from the Old Testament and by leaning into the words of Jesus. Well, that's awesome and wildly successful, but it's not going to make sense to Roman people. And Mark has a soft spot in his heart for Roman people. So he writes to them, they're not going to know or care about or have as much patience for all the lore and background stuff. So he leans into the actions of Jesus to demonstrate that Jesus is the Messiah, the servant, the one who delivers not just the Jewish people, but the whole world. Luke comes along as a Gentile outsider, and he's got a Greek brain, very philosophical, thinking about the unseen world and its relationship with the physical world. And so even though Luke very much acknowledges the deity of Jesus throughout his gospel, his emphasis is on the humanity of Jesus, the incarnation. That's why we get that big birth story in Luke. It makes sense that he would hit that physical birth human part of Jesus harder than any of the other gospel writers. And to accomplish that with his audience in mind, he leans into the ordered details of the story of Jesus. Well, then sometime later after Matthew, Mark and Luke, along comes this fourth gospel of John. It was almost surely written after 70 AD. That's a very important date that you and I haven't talked about yet, but it's the date that represents the destruction of the second temple, the one that Zarubahbol and Ezra and Nehemiah were around for that was built back during the time of the Persians and expanded before the life of Christ under the direction of Herod the Great. That grand glorious temple gets wrecked in 70 AD about 40 years after the execution and resurrection of Jesus. This is a landmark watershed moment in the history of everything. Certainly John was written comfortably after that calamitous incident and that fits with what we know about the lifespan of John the Apostle who was in the inner circle of followers of Jesus who we think is referred to in the Bible as the disciple who Jesus loved. That kid, John would have just been a teenager when all of the Jesus stuff was happening and he lived probably to around 100 AD then wrote a whole bunch of stuff including the historical church believes this gospel of John. Now John was definitely super aware that there were ordered quality accounts of the life of Jesus already floating around and both because that ground had already been well covered and because times had changed John sets out to do something different. He's not writing to Jews or Romans or Greeks. He's writing to the church and he's writing to convince them or remind them that explicitly Jesus is God in the flesh. He leans in specifically to certain signs that Jesus does, seven of them that are meant to say Jesus is God in the flesh and he leans into seven statements where Jesus says I am the this, I am the this and those I am statements are referenced back to how God introduced himself by name and the burning bush to Moses. Moses is like, all right, I'll go back and talk to him. But who should I say sent me? And God says, tell them I am sent to you. In other words, I'm not just some cheap regional deity or an idol. I am essence. I am being. I am the God. Being short of pure and complete existence could even begin as a name to properly summarize the scope and expanse of the infinitude of this God and John is making the case that that God took on flesh in Jesus and Jesus is indeed God. It's a big bold statement and it's a clarifying statement for the early church who were just starting to get their mitts on all of these accounts of Jesus and as we're starting to get into generation two and generation three and generation four of Christianity and John is one of the last living witnesses. All the other disciples got killed in grizzly ways by this point. He wants to spell out crystal clearly. Hey, let there be no ambiguity. He claimed to be God. And just like Matthew, Mark and Luke before him, John also has a thesis statement at the end of the book. It falls out. Hey, Jesus did a ton of other stuff kind of acknowledging. You've read the other books here familiar with Matthew, Mark and Luke implicitly. That seems to be what he's saying. He did a ton of other stuff. We could fill infinite number of books with the things Jesus said and did. But what I have gathered here, I have gathered so that you would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God and that by believing you may have life in his name. That's what John is going for. That's the gauntlet he's throwing down. That's what he wants to reassure the early church in. And that's what he wants to compel those who are not yet Christians toward who would come upon this book. Now, John's gospel has material that's over 90% exclusive to John. So he's clearly picking up recollections and details that he thinks need to be preserved that didn't necessarily factor super heavily into the thesis or goals of Matthew, Mark and Luke. It's a very unique section in chapter one that talks about the word of God taking on flesh and that looks all the way back to the whole scope of history indicating that this isn't some new idea, but that this was God's plan to deliver through Jesus, to reveal himself through Jesus, to take on flesh all along. Then after that, for the most part, things start up north in Galilee and Jesus has these disputations, these back and forths with religious leaders and other people who don't know what to make of them. And over the course of that, many respond enthusiastically, many hang around and are curious but don't know what to make of him. And many others become very angry. Then, just like what we talked about in the gospel of Luke, Jesus sets his face toward Jerusalem heads in that direction, John holds out the death of his buddy Lazarus as being the initiating event that moves him southward from the relatively safe confines of the north to the very unsafe big city and headquarters of all of his enemies down in Jerusalem. And in the pivot passage of the book, Jesus answers the last big remaining question about what kind of authority he actually wields. Can he back all of this up when he raises Lazarus from the dead, anticipating his own resurrection from the dead? After that, Jesus is received in Jerusalem with enthusiasm. He teaches his disciples a whole bunch more. He runs into all kinds of pushback. We get one big extended chunk of thought from him, including this beautiful, intimate prayer for the unity of future believers that as future believers are one that everybody would know that he and the father are one. And then he goes to trial. He goes to execution. He's raised from the dead. And then we even get this little epilogue in chapter 21 where it looks like John was trying to provide some grand fatherly senior guidance through the words of Christ to a church. That was just starting to find its footing and maybe wasn't totally sure coming out of Matthew, Mark and Luke what to do with the legacy of Peter and some of the other disciples who wavered and fell apart under pressure during the events of Jesus crucifixion and whatnot. And so we get Jesus restoration of Peter and the whole thrust of chapter 21 almost feels like a benediction of blessing and exhortation on John's way out the door to say that Jesus was teaching that his church will thrive when they depend on and focus on and listen to the son of God, God in the flesh, the Christ, the Messiah, the king, the centerpiece of the church and God's redemptive plan, Jesus Christ himself. Now when we look back on this with the 10,000 foot view, we see that the whole book is punctuated by these seven I am statements that I was referencing earlier. Each of those accentuates a unique element or implication of his deity. They all accentuate his connection with his father and the summary version goes like this. He says, I'm the bread of life. I am the light of the world. I am the gate. I am the good shepherd. I am the resurrection and the life. I am the way, the truth and the life. I am the true vine. And ultimately the whole I aming gets one extra spike of the football when the enemies of Jesus come to have him arrested and they're like, Hey, are you Jesus? And he's like, I am. And they all fall down physically because of the force of this declaration of Jesus deity every now and then I'll hear people on the internet say, well, Jesus never claimed to be God. And to that I would say, I suspect that person has not read the book of John or if they did read the book of John, they skimmed it and they haven't read the rest of the Bible. It really is in the context of the larger Bible, absolutely explicit, pounded again and again that Jesus is claiming to be God in the gospel of John. And if understandably, that's kind of a lot to take in and think through. It just takes us right back to John's thesis statement in chapter 20 and verse 30. Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. I say again, but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ to the son of God and that by believing you may have life in his name. When you visualize the gospel of John, picture three letters, I and then am I am. There's no image that can better summarize what this gospel is about than those two simple words. When you think about the theme, reflect on Jesus is God. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to read enough of the context of the following passages to understand the I am statements that Jesus is making. Read the material around six 35 eight 12 10 seven through 14. There are two I am statements in there 11 25 14 six and the first part of chapter 15. We'll put all of that down in the show notes as well. If you didn't have a chance to write it down, the gospels, what an amazing payoff on all the setup from the Old Testament, what an amazing moment in and of themselves, what an amazing character to have God take on flesh. And now with the rest of the New Testament, we get to consider what the amazing implications of this will be moving forward. We got the book of Acts next time around. I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Acts. If you made me name my favorite book of the Bible that isn't Matthew, it would be Acts. I did a whole series on the Book of Acts. This is my very first thing that I ever did on the internet back in the day. I did a video series on Acts, like 90 episodes long. It took me forever to get it done. And I was just in love with this book because the historian part of me couldn't get enough of how much this perfectly overlapped with first century history. But the other reason I love this book is because it's the very necessary story of the message of Jesus, the life and the work of Jesus' death and his resurrection actually playing out in the larger world, basically the whole world as it was known at that time in a way that is compelling. It's one thing to come out of the Old Testament and be like, wow, it's crystal clear that this whole God thing is meant for everyone and that the prophets all predict that this is going to go to the ends of the earth and that everybody's going to come and worship the one true God and the God is going to use his chosen people to see this through. It's all there. But what's that going to look like? And now, yeah, you and I live in the age of globalism and mass marketing and everything's connected by the interwebs, but a global religious movement in the first century. A.D. was unthinkable. People didn't conceive of religion this way. They didn't conceive of there being one God who was for everyone with one family of faith. This kingdom, this collection of people that just lays right over the top of political secular history that said acts is the second half of a two part volume by Luke. Now Luke and acts technically are anonymous documents, but there's not really any competing theory for who wrote these two books. Early Christian leaders all agreed that it's Luke, but additionally, there's all kinds of internal evidence throughout the New Testament that says it's Luke. Paul specifically names a traveling companion, a physician named Luke. And if we look at the places where Paul in his letters talks about that guy, it lines up perfectly with the places in the book of acts where the language changes from then those people did that and those people did that to first person language, then we did this, then we did that. That is to say that the author of Luke and acts is present for a good junk of the adventuring in the book of acts. The book of acts has a teeny, tiny, little bit of shaded area of the Venn diagram worth of overlap with the very end of Luke. So it repeats a little bit of stuff. And then we're off and running Jesus ascends to the right hand of the father, but not until he has a very important exchange with his followers. They're all kind of milling around and they're like, well, are we going to have a reckoning now? Are you going to go sort things out with all the people who are awful to you and killed you now that you're back from the grave? Or at least that's what they're in Tony. And Jesus says in so many words, that's not your timing to worry about. We'll sort that out later. But right now, you guys are going to be by witnesses in Jerusalem, then in Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth. And what we get there is one more commissioning for all of the age of the church, all the followers of Jesus. This is your job. Your impulse is to be outward. The arrow doesn't point in. The eyes don't look down with proper Jesus following. The eyes are always up. The arrow is always pointing outward because the message of life is for everyone. And if you have received this beautiful gift of forgiveness and new life and hope, then you got to go give that away to other people. And so that stuff that Jesus says there in Acts 1, 8 Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria to the ends of the earth, you're going to be my witnesses to all of that. That provides a theological trajectory for the disciples and all of Christian history. But it also provides a really helpful outline for the book of Acts, which does exactly what Jesus says. We start in Jerusalem and sort some things out there. Then we move into the larger region out into the Roman province of Judea, which includes Jerusalem, but also up north and to Gentile and Samaritan territory. And then as we move into the third chunk of the book, we see the message go out to the ends of the earth, to Asia Minor, to Greece, to the Italian peninsula. Now, like I have read the book of Acts many, many, many times, but never as much as these last couple of times through in preparation for this conversation. Have I caught how every single bit of every single narrative rhymes with something else we've seen in the Bible, either from the life of Jesus or from the minor prophets or from something that happened in captivity or from Egypt or Genesis, Luke is going out of his way to demonstrate that this story has massive narrative continuity with everything that God has done in the past. And this is not a split off from what God was doing. This is the center channel of that story you've been reading about. This is the resolution to it. And indeed you get two gigantic payoffs to that stuff from the Old Testament, the first of which is this idea of going out to all the nations. And the other big payoff we see is the arrival of the presence of God in a new way that was predicted back in the Old Testament and Haggai in Ezekiel, very memorably in Joel chapter two. It's this idea that that presence of God, who we see in the Ark of the Covenant, we see it in the first temple that Solomon built. And then there are some questions about exactly where it is with that second temple. But the idea is that in the Old Testament, God's presence is dwelling among his people in this holy place. But the prophets start to predict that God's presence will dwell among all of his people, not just confined in a visible sense to a building or a singular space, but this widespread presence of God among his people is going to be somehow indicative of a new and better paradigm in the relationship between God and man. And if you recall coming out of the Old Testament, that's what the story is begging for. We can tell those payoffs are coming right at the beginning. And as early as chapter two, we know this is the way it's going to play out because all the disciples are gathered together and they're waiting around in Jerusalem. Just like Jesus said to do, he said, wait there, I'm going to send my spirit. Well, then he does. They're in some public place in Jerusalem and the Holy Spirit shows up not in the form God's presence took in the past, that being this smoke or this cloud, but in the form of something that produces smoke or a cloud, flames and these tongues of flame as crazy as this sounds appear above the heads of the disciples. And all of a sudden they can speak languages. They theoretically don't know how to speak and all these people from all these different parts of the world are in Jerusalem, which is the intersection of planet earth at this point in history. And they all hear the message of Jesus in their own language and thousands of them on day one are like, yeah, that's the truest, realest thing I've ever heard in my life. I am absolutely in on that. And they become Christians. And from that moment on all the way up to this moment right now, wherever you are, whenever you are listening to this, this thing has been a runaway train. There has been absolutely no stopping it. And people have tried with swords, with guns, with prisons, but this message of the kingdom and the king behind it rings so true and so cross culturally and so cross linguistically that like Jesus predicted, it went from this little tiny seed to grow into this great big gigantic tree that all these different disparate birds and animals can come and take shelter in metaphorically. Well section one, the Jerusalem section is defined by wild immediate growth upon the arrival of the Holy Spirit, but it's also characterized by massive resistance from the same people who just got done executing Jesus. That's kind of embarrassing because that was supposed to go away, but it's not going away now. And they just can't seem to flog their way out of the problem. And eventually a member of Generation two of Christianity, a leader in the church named Stephen gets up and gives this speech that's kind of like second chronicles. He summarizes huge chunks of the Old Testament and it's like, look, we all know the story. It points to Jesus. Why are you people resisting this? And they get real, real mad and they do a thing that they didn't even have the courage to do to Jesus. Remember, they're not allowed to kill people. Only the Romans are the Jews aren't the government. The Romans are the government. Well, they're so angry at Stephen. They don't even care and they drag him out and they spontaneously pelt him with rocks until he dies and standing there approving of the whole thing is a high ranking, very zealous, enthusiastic opponent of Jesus named Saul. That concludes the Jerusalem section of the book. Now we see the Judea and Samaria section of the book where the message goes out further north even into modern day Syria. The roots get put down and Antioch, not Jerusalem becomes the headquarters of Christianity. It's where people are first called Christians. But eventually there's a degree of friction between how these Gentile outsiders and Antioch are understanding Christian faith and how the old school Jewish converts to Christianity and Jerusalem are seeing Christian faith. And they have to have a get together in chapter 15 to sort that through. And ultimately what they decide is, yeah, God's made it abundantly clear. This is for all the nations. They reference back to the book of Amos that you and I looked to straight at a passage right there in the last chapter of Amos that says, once again, this is for all the nations and the Jerusalem Christians and the Antioch Christians. That is the Jewish Christians and the Gentile Christians. They all come together and agree. Yeah, we can't make these Gentile Christians. Do all of the old traditional Jewish stuff. That law is fulfilled in Christ and they move forward as a basically unified church saying, Jesus messages for everyone. There is a new family of faith and we're taking this out to the broader culture. Well, in the interim, two really important things happened. One, Peter in his last significant appearance in the entire New Testament historical record gets a vision from God where God says that the purity laws have been fulfilled completed in Christ and the Gentiles can be Christians. It's for them and you can associate with them and also food is clean. You don't have to call unclean what God has declared clean. That's a huge shift. And then the second big thing that happens is remember that Saul guy who was there supervising the murder of Stephen? He's on his way to round up Christians and put an end to this nonsense on behalf of the religious leadership in Jerusalem. But Jesus shows up and knocks him off his horse and blinds him and he tells Saul, there's no two ways about this. You're going to follow me and you're going to be my apostle and I'm going to use you to reach all these people from all these different places. And somewhere in there, people quit calling him Saul and start calling him Paul. Paul does what he's told eventually regains his sight. Even though everybody's pretty nervous about him in the early going, it turns out it was real and he becomes the apostle to the Gentiles. Well, at that point, the original disciples who followed Jesus around, we don't hear from them as much moving forward. And Paul and his traveling companions, including Luke, become the centerpiece in this third part of the book of Acts that is the two, the ends of the earth part. This section is made up of three great, big, giant missionary journeys where Paul takes an unbelievable beating at every turn. Maybe earlier on, you were like, why would like some guy just goes around and like gives sermons and stuff, need a personal physician. But then you read Acts and you're like, Oh, wow, shipwrecked all the time, getting bit by snakes. He's getting stoned by people until he looks dead, constantly imprisoned and deprived of things, rioters try to murder him. It really doesn't go well from a physical point of view for Paul. Plus he says that he's got some kind of physical ailment, some sort of thorn in his side. Now Luke was very needed to keep slapping duct tape on Paul to keep him in the game as long as he could so he could do all of this stuff. And then in the final section, Paul against a whole bunch of warnings from a whole bunch of people who really care about him decides to go back to Jerusalem to confront his old buddies, his old classmates and be like, guys, look, Jesus is the real deal, but he doesn't even make it all the way through his speech and they try to kill him and then Rome arrests him. And then the last section of the book is Paul sitting in prison for huge chunks of time. And you would think, well, probably not much happens there. This guy thrives when he's out and about doing stuff, but not so even behind bars, Paul is wildly effective in advancing the message of Jesus. Really, whether he's in prison or he's free, he's always operating from a position of political weakness, but he doesn't act like it because he's absolutely convinced of the message that he's carrying out and the greater reality of the king and the kingdom he represents. And that sets quite the tone for the rest of the New Testament and the rest of the era of Christianity. When you visualize the book of Acts, picture fire, when you think about the theme, reflect on the kingdom expanding to the ends of the earth under the leadership of the Holy Spirit. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, and really, this is such a magnificent, sweeping theological, historical epic, I hope you do find time to read it all. But if you don't, make sure to check out the arrival of the Holy Spirit at the beginning of chapter two. Make sure you check out Stephen's speech in chapter seven and make sure you check out Paul's conversion account in chapter nine versus one through nineteen. Alright, I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Romans. As we turn the page in the book of Acts to the book of Romans, we are getting into a whole new genre, a whole new mode of the Bible. With the New Testament, we've got the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. I'll tell the story of Jesus in different ways, for different audiences, with different points of emphasis, leaning into different things to achieve what they're trying to achieve. It gives us a very thorough picture of how Jesus is and what he did and what the point is of what he did. It also sets the trajectory for this eyes up, arrows out, always forward movement in the building of this kingdom, of this new family of faith. When we see how that plays out throughout the book of Acts, as a whole bunch of people latch onto this impulse and go and do what they're supposed to do. But when we get done with the book of Acts, that's the end of narrative stuff in the New Testament. As we turn the page over to the book of Romans, what we see is that now the first couple sentences sounds like a letter, because it is a letter. The Romans one opens with Paul, a servant of Christ to Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God, the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures regarding his son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David. Whoa, we're off and running here. We just learned a bunch of things. One, our suspicions are correct. This is indeed a letter to if we go down a few more verses, it says to all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints. Okay. So it's written to Christians in Rome, which means that three, we can deduce that we must be talking about Jewish people because in the very early church, most of the Christians were Jewish people. But also we must be talking to Gentile Christians. I mean, the book of Mark was written to Romans and that would have included a bunch of Gentiles. The day of Pentecost happened in Acts chapter two. And there's a church in Rome, which is not really a Jewish town. So this is interesting. This letter is being directed to a mixed audience church of Jews and Gentiles. Wonder how things are going over there more on that in just a minute. For we figure out real quick that this Paul fellow is going to factor heavily. Now we learned a lot about Saul who came to be called Paul in the book of Acts. He was the super zealous Pharisee who attended the execution of Stevens, Muggly sat there holding everybody's coats so they could get their arms limbered up and mobile so they could better whip rocks at a guy and illegally execute him like savages. Paul is right there the whole time being like, yeah, this is great. This is how things ought to be. This is awesome. This is why I signed up for church and religions. We could hit people with rocks like this is exactly how I want things to be. And it's so good. I want to take this show on the road. And so Paul, Saul is the one who volunteers to go up north. I'm going to round up some Christians and some of these other little Christian hotbeds and we'll do some more of this rock killing and arresting and stuff. But it's on his way up to Damascus that he has this encounter with the risen Christ. Then he's changed forever. Then he becomes the apostle of Jesus, especially to the Gentiles. Enter the book of Romans. Well, there's an emperor named Claudius and he had bigger fish to fry than Jewish problems and instability in the capital city of Rome. And in a fit of frustration at one point, he just kicked all the Jews out and he's just get out of here, be gone. You guys are a pain in my butt in Judea. The last thing I need is all of that tension here in my backyard. So Claudius just kicks him out in the grand scheme of all of the exiles we've seen so far in the Bible. This one is pretty paltry. The Jews were allowed to come back pretty quickly. But that is enough time for some factions to develop in Rome. You got a bunch of Gentile Christians. And when they look at the Old Testament, all they see is stuff that points to Jesus. Prophecies fulfilled. This is really exciting, but the Jewish Christians, when they returned from being exiled and now they're back in the church in Rome, what it looks like, they're kind of mad about stuff because they're looking at these Gentile Christians. I mean, like you guys are being flippant. We got all these rules and obligations and you guys are going to need to do those or you're just not taking it very seriously. That is the situation into which Paul is writing this letter to the Romans. And Paul is trying to get the church in Rome to get along. One, because Jesus prayed that all of us would be one just as he and the father are one back in John 17. But also Paul is trying to accomplish something here and squabbling is getting in the way. He wants to reach the entire Roman world with the message of Jesus and invite people into this new family of faith and established churches all over the place. So he's got his eyes set on the Roman province of Hispaniya, modern day Spain. And he's going to need the support of a unified healthy Roman church to make that trip. So you got those two motivations for writing the letter. But then the third motivation is that Paul is absolutely convinced this whole Jesus thing and that there's life and salvation in it. And clearly he believes that what's going to bridge the divide and heal the damage and division in this church is simply to spell out what the basic message is, what the gospel message is, the heartbeat of the message of Jesus in a way that they're all going to explain and in a way that anticipates the questions that they're going to have. Now about halfway through chapter once in the pretty early going, Paul lays out the thesis statement for this letter, which would have been read aloud to everybody there. And it goes like this, I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. See what he's doing there for in the gospel, a righteousness from God is revealed a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written, the righteous will live by faith. He's thrown down the gauntlet and said, I'm going to demonstrate that there is a righteousness that makes us right with God that is not from how well we can obey rules, but it is by the work of Christ and it is given to people by God through faith. That is very different than how Jewish Christians had been thinking about their relationship with God prior to this. This is very dense, very complex theology throughout the book of Romans. And I don't think I can cram it neatly into this amount of time, but the big picture goes like this. Paul makes the case that everybody, not just the Jews, not just the Gentiles, everybody has that stain of sin on them. These failed the test. Everybody has got that deep into their roots. Our hearts are corrupt and broken. They want sin. And further, Paul argues, we can't fix it through effort. We've had a billion different attempts, a bunch of different paradigms we've tried for people to really get it right and really come around this time and actually do the right thing all the time. So much that God likes it and is impressed. Paul's like, no way, it's never happening. We got a massive sample size and we know our own hearts. It can't be achieved. We need then a righteousness that is apart from the law. Now Jesus hinted at this and more than hinted at it, right at the beginning of his public ministry in Matthew chapter five, when he's saying, look, I didn't come to abolish the law and the prophets. I came to fulfill them. And by law and prophets there, he doesn't just mean the rules of the Old Testament. He also means the whole story of what you and I called the Old Testament, but then Jesus goes on to say that, you know, your righteousness would have to surpass that of the Pharisees, the very people who get to make the rules in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. And so what Jesus is saying there is there's going to have to be a righteousness that comes from God because it's unattainable by human effort. Well, that's Paul's opening argument as well. We all got this problem and we can't fix it through proper behavior, self control. That will not make us righteous in the eyes of God to God's standards. But then Paul pivots to good news. This is why Jesus, the Messiah came. It wasn't to kill the Romans and get rid of the emperor. There's a whole different kind of kingdom that was going to be built on his sacrifice on the cross where the Messiah takes on the sins of the world, takes on all of that brokenness and he absorbs the punishment. Later on, Paul is going to say in 2 Corinthians that he became sin for us, even though he knew no sin, so that by him, you and me, we might become the righteousness of God. You see, Paul is drilling this point that we are made right with God, not by stuff we do. We are made right with God by the work of Christ. And this work of Christ in the life of the believer transforms the state of being of that Christian from being an enemy of the kingdom of God, to being a part of the family of God, a son, a daughter, a child, an heir to this kingdom, an agent of this kingdom with responsibility in this kingdom. It's a total transformation that occurs and it's all because of the work of Jesus. And this again is that new family of faith, the completion of the family of faith idea that we see in the Old Testament. It's that new paradigm. But then that raises the question like, well, what gives? Did God screw up with the whole law thing? Is this version 2.0? And he just didn't have his strategy together the first time around. But now with the Jesus thing, it's going to work out while Paul is saying, no, not at all, because humanity wouldn't have understood how given over to sin, how absolutely broken our situation was without the law to point out our inability to achieve this righteousness that is required to be in the kingdom of God on our own. The law points out how badly we need a righteousness that is apart from the law and that is given to us by God, the only one who actually is righteous. And the only one who actually has that to give away. And then Paul goes on to argue that when we get that righteousness from God, now for the first time ever, humans are equipped with a new heart that is able to obey God for the right reasons by the presence of his spirit in the life of transformed people. So we said all throughout the Gospels, we said at the end of the Old Testament, this situation is begging for a new paradigm in the relationship between God and man. And here Paul is explicitly spelling out a new paradigm for both Jews and Gentiles alike. Then the closing third of the book, Paul starts to land the plane. He's like, look, in light of all of this, in light of what the gospel is, here's how it makes sense to live publicly. Here's how it makes sense to treat each other. Here's why it makes sense for there to be peace among us. And Paul is saying, I'm giving you a theological rationale for this that is drawn from everything that is about Jesus and everything that is about the work of the spirit and everything that is about the Old Testament. I'm not just making stuff up like a college freshman is like, come on, guys, let's just try peace. Can we please just get along? This new family of faith is genuinely special. It's backed by God. God is among us and we can have peace in a way that is transformative for us and the people who see what's going on with us outside of our boundaries. It's so dang good. It's so well argued. I hope you'll read the whole thing. Really, if you don't have time to read any other book in the entire Bible, my recommendation would be to get, well, I'd say get John and then get Romans. These are the two that really lay out what it looks like and what the rationale is behind it for how you or I respond in this day and age to what Jesus is doing and where we fit with all of that. When you visualize the book of Romans, picture a new heart, one that was broken, but one that has been made new and reborn in Jesus. When you think about the theme, we'll just go right back there to Romans 1, 16 and 17. The gospel is the power of salvation for everyone who believes for in it. There's a righteousness from God. It's a righteousness that is by faith from God and the righteous will live by that faith. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get chapter 1, verses 16 and 17 that I keep referencing. Then hit Romans 3, 23, Romans 3, 10 through 18, Romans 6, 23, Romans 5, 8, Romans 10, 9, Romans 10, 13, Romans 5, 1, Romans 8, 1, and finally Romans 8, 38 through 39. I know that's a lot, but we're going to put all of that down in the show notes so you can reference it there. And with that, Romans achievement unlocked. First Corinthians next time around. I'm Matt.

Right now, we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about First Corinthians. The Book of First Corinthians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to a church that he helped found in Corinth. And the occasion of the writing of this letter is that everything is horrible. The church has gone off the rails, and any way they can think of to screw things up they have thought of. Now, you might be tempted, along with me, to be stupid other people, always getting things wrong. How can they not know better? But then you step back and you think about it for a minute, and it becomes pretty easy to cut these folks some slack and to want to be patient with them. Think about how this church in Corinth happened. Paul shows up there. He stays with them for a very long time because people are hearing about the message of Jesus, and it's awesome. They're even seeing miraculous stuff, and their minds are changed, their hearts are changed. But also, they don't know how to do church. They don't have a Bible yet, no New Testament at least, and they're deeply rooted in the culture that they've been a part of forever. There's no template for what church looks like yet. This is brand new territory for these people. So Paul is an interesting character in terms of how he relates to these churches he helped found, because on the one hand, he's like a friendly spiritual father to all these people, and he's patient, and he explains things again and again. In fact, this whole middle section of the New Testament is made up mostly of letters, the fancy term for these epistles. But these letters are written from Paul to churches that he cares about, and there's usually a reason that he's writing them. Maybe there's a theology question that came up. Maybe somebody made a big mistake. Maybe there's a culture problem within the church. Maybe there's a culture problem in the larger world, and the church doesn't know what to do with it. Well, Paul weighs back in and gives guidance. So on the one hand, Paul is very invested and very patient. On the other hand, Paul has expectations, because like he said to the Romans, hey, you have a new heart. You have been regenerated and given new life, and you're choosing willfully to act in ways that are consistent with the old life. And you shouldn't be doing that anymore. In this letter that he's writing to the Corinthian church, there's all kinds of immorality and busted up unjust, gross stuff going on. That just isn't going to work. The church isn't going to hold if people keep living the way and thinking the way and treating each other the way they are. And so Paul comes along and he's like, hey, the antidote to all of your really ugly behavior is for you to better understand the message of Jesus, the work of Jesus, the gospel of Jesus, and for you to let it inform your life. In all these letters, you get kind of the two versions of Paul that I was talking about a second ago. You get the fatherly patient version of Paul, but you also get the disciplinarian father who's like, hey, nobody else is going to come along and be able to speak into your life and prompt you toward what this is supposed to look like as Christians in Christ's church. So I'm going to do that, even if at times it is unpleasant and a bit confrontational and to be totally honest. First Corinthians is at times a bit unpleasant and quite confrontational because Paul is getting after people. He's invested in deeply and he's getting after people who agreed to have Paul be the person who could speak into their lives like that. Well, Corinth, first of all, just as a city stacks the deck against these fledgling Christians because the culture there is a broken mass. Corinth was an ancient world adjective. I mean, for something to be Corinthian meant that it was a moral dumpster fire. It was debauched. It was a port city that sits on this little narrow it's miss that divides Greece in half. And for centuries, people had found it more convenient to empty their boats, put them up on logs and portage their ships across that narrow little it's miss of Corinth, then it was the sale all the way around. So you got a whole bunch of outsiders. You've got all kinds of accommodations for these swarly sailors who are inland for a day or two, working their butts off to move these ships. And in addition to those conditions that made things a little bit rough and tumble in this neck of the woods, you also had a patron deity in ancient Corinth and their patron goddess is Aphrodite. That's the goddess of love. Weird debauched sex stuff was baked into the culture, even the religion of Corinth and had been for a really long time. In a lot of all of that, it was surely no surprise to Paul that he was going to have to have this conversation. He had to know that Corinth was something of a time bomb and that there would be a lot to overcome here culturally. So in keeping with that, he writes a letter that goes point by point through five big issues that are causing damage and disunity in the church. So the letter is basically divided into these five sections that all start with Paul very descriptively explaining what is going wrong with specifics and talking about why it's wrong and damaging and problematic. And then the solution that he offers is always a reorientation in light of the gospel, who Jesus is, what the values of the kingdom are and what the mission and the reason for the existence of the church in Corinth is. In part one, he talks about factions and infighting. He talks about Christians, Sue and other people and Aaron, all of their dirty laundry in front of everybody using a secular Roman court of being bound together by the love of Christ to work things out together. In that section, he also talks about how there's this weird Christian celebrity worship thing that is happening and the grossness of that, the laughability of that even. And Paul, of course, points back to Christ as king of the entire church and tries to reorient the Corinthians in light of that. In part two, Paul addresses the sexual chaos that was going on in Corinth. And look, my friends, quick aside here, there's no two ways about it. Sex is a beautiful aspect of life in terms of intimacy in the deepest levels of connectedness and emotion. And it's also a really easy one to screw up with the body and with the mind and the emotions. It's the kind of thing that people might get wrong at some point in their life externally or internally. And I am not the ultimate judge of people I sit around and have a conversation with on the Internet. Paul, on the other hand, was in a position where he was a spiritual father to these people. He knew them in person. He knew what their weaknesses were and their strengths were. And effectively, they had asked him to speak into their lives on this thing. They all knew there was a chance that this was going to be a difficult thing given the culture that they were a part of. And Paul speaks to it very boldly and very specifically. He calls out Corinthian cultural norms that were totally accepted societally, but that were wildly unhealthy and destructive. And of course, people didn't want to hear it. For all of the reasons I just talked about and even more, but still, Paul courageously makes the case that this is chewing up the church and shipwrecking the effectiveness of the church. It's causing the deep disunity in doing damage to individuals, to families, and to the whole effectiveness of the church's ability to serve other people and to reach people with the good news of the kingdom. Again, he points them back to the values of the gospel as the antidote for that. And then in part three, we run into a really interesting situation that seems like a very foreign conundrum to us until you look a little bit closer and you're like, oh, no, actually, I think there are situations like that in society today as well. In Corinth, there were a whole bunch of Greek and Roman gods, and people would sacrifice meat to these gods, but then they were allowed to eat it afterwards. But there was a concern among the Christians. Some more Jewish Christians in this church were like, no, you can't eat food that's been sacrificed to an idol. It is done. That is participating in idolatry yourself if you do it. But then there were Corinthian Christians who were like, really? I mean, of all the things that are completely societally normative that we probably shouldn't worry about, this one. I mean, no one is looking at that and thinking that we believe in whatever God they sacrificed that food to at the barbecue at their house where they invite us over to just have food with them. Like if we're at a non-Christians house, and first they sacrifice their food or whatever, we can still eat it. That's fine. Well, Paul speaks into the situation and echoing the theme of shrewdness that is woven throughout all of Jesus' teaching in the gospels. He's like, hey, if this is the kind of thing that even though you're free to do it, you do, and it causes big time damage to the church because you flaunt it or you're just generally careless about it, maybe you could restrict your freedoms on that voluntarily for the greater goods that we don't have to be constrained to making a whole bunch of rules to try to make this thing go. And maybe if your conscience really says don't eat that kind of food, you could not eat that kind of food, but you could also try to extend some kind of patience to people who don't share that same conviction of conscience. And so rather than writing a new rule, Paul articulates a gospel kingdom principle to give these Christians in Corinth a pathway to move forward. And I think this is a really interesting part of the book when you sit around and think about what it's like to live in a pluralistic society as a Christian today. There's stuff that is really screwed up that I have massive problems with, but if there isn't an obvious justice element, sometimes I look at that and I feel like, well, the shrewd thing to do is to just be patient with things that I really don't like and don't agree with, but there are Christians who feel differently about that than I do. And maybe there's some guidance when it comes to thinking through some of those public issues and social issues of the day in the thinking of Paul here in the middle of this letter to the church in Corinth. Apparently there was another problem in Corinth and that was that the worship services were crazy. People had really latched on to how it felt in those early days when miracles were popping and people could speak in foreign languages and there were prophecies like we see everywhere in the Book of Acts or even in the Gospels when the message of Jesus shows up, crazy stuff seems to happen at least in the early going, maybe for even longer, but it made for worship services that were becoming scattered and unfocused and that Paul charges were becoming a source of pride for people to demonstrate that they were the most Christian or that they could do the most Christian miraculous stuff. And he points again to the character of Jesus, the values of the kingdom to say, now there should be order in worship and the whole thing should be about glorifying God, not glorifying yourself. Finally, there is apparently a philosophical question about the nature of resurrection of the body. And this makes sense given where Greek philosophy was at at the time. But rather than diving all the way into all of that, Paul simply says Jesus was resurrected from the dead and if we don't believe that resurrection is an actual thing, this whole deal is a good thing. The whole deal is a joke. The whole letter I just wrote you is a joke. But then he goes on to say, but he has been raised. Look at this. And so here on this fifth controversy about resurrection of the dead and what happens when people die, Paul just points to the main character of the entire religion, Jesus of Nazareth. And he's like, the reason you believe in him is because he came back from the dead. So yeah, resurrection has to be a thing. Now remember, 1 Corinthians is an occasional. Something happened and Paul wrote to that to a specific group of people. So there's a ton more stuff that Paul thinks about more things and he might even frame it, phrase it or use an example a little differently if he was speaking on roughly the same subject matter, but to a slightly different group of people in a different town. But everything he does speak to here is kingdom, Christian theology in response to the real circumstances of a real moment in a real church that Paul was very acquainted with firsthand. When you visualize the book of 1 Corinthians, picture the body of Christ because that is what Paul is trying to nurture through the values of Jesus and the example of Jesus in the face of really ugly, sinful behavior that was damaging the church. When you think about the theme of 1 Corinthians, reflect on how gospel love informs everything. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go catch chapter 13, but try to read it with fresh eyes and think of it in the larger context. What we're talking about here and not just in the context of a cross stitch that your aunt might have given you for your wedding. Alright, we've leveled up 1 Corinthians. We'll see about leveling up 2 Corinthians next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon."}, {"meta_data": {"duration": "14:02", "episode_num": "BIBLE47", "pub_date": "Wed, 08 Mar 2023 05:00:00 +0000", "subtitle": "Thanks to everyone who supports TMBH at\u00a0 You're the reason we can all do this together!

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about second Corinthians. It looks like the Apostle Paul wrote at least four letters to the church in Corinth. Two of those we still have, and both of the letters that we have between Paul and the church in Corinth, are in the New Testament. So in 2 Corinthians, Paul is following up on stuff that he wrote to the very troubled church in Corinth in 1 Corinthians. And the positive note here, as we turn the page from 1 Corinthians to 2 Corinthians, is it looked like it kind of worked. It looks like things are getting better in Corinth, but they're not out of the woods. This is clearly a very difficult church. And at first glance, from a couple thousand years away, it might be easy to be like, well, these people were just clearly inferior. They just weren't very good at being Christians. But if you look a little more closely at the background of Corinth, like you and I tried to do in our last conversation on 1 Corinthians, I think you feel a little more empathetic. Now, look, last time around, we talked about the reality that there's an almost millennium-old sex cult to the goddess Aphrodite that had always been associated with Corinth. I mean, it's their patron goddess is the goddess associated with sex and licentiousness. That's going to leave a mark on the culture. But something we didn't talk about last time was the political instability of Corinth. Corinth as a proud history, by the time we encounter it in the first century, it's one of the great ancient Greek cities. Whenever you see that fuzzy, topped Mohawk helmet in any kind of depiction of Greek warfare, that's called a Corinthian helmet. They were proud allies of the Spartans. They also fought against the Spartans. All the Greeks fought against each other at some point or another. But then in the middle of the second century BC, as the Roman Republic is really getting into that expansion mode, there are problems in Greece and a couple of prominent Roman leaders get dispatched to go and finally get Greece under control. In the midst of that campaign, Corinth gets caught up and it gets wiped out by the Romans, who were in the habit of doing that to trouble some cities from time to time, see Carthage in North Africa. Well, Corinth just goes dormant for a hundred years. And coincidentally, that hundred years that Corinth is more or less gone corresponds pretty closely to the hundred years that the Jews had their independent Maccabean kingdom before the Romans came and shut that down. Well, about the same time that the Romans come and shut down the Maccabean kingdom, they also go and start back up resuscitate, revive the city of Corinth. But not as a Greek city, it's a straight up Roman colony. Like they took Roman citizens and Roman government and they dropped it right over the top of the ruins of ancient Corinth. So this is a town then that is emblematic of the vigorous shaking up of the ant farm and the new pathways that cut as a result of the ancient Mediterranean world under the influence of the storm of the earthquake of the tsunami that is Rome. When we understand Corinth in this way, we understand how crazy it must have looked to everybody in early Christianity to try to go and start a church there, let alone persist, as soon as things predictably went off the rails, Corinth lacked identity, Corinth lacked integrity, Corinth lacked roots, it lacked grounding. Fair or not, it was a town that was a metaphor for chasing after whatever is recent and expedient. It just doesn't seem like that's a place where you want to go. If you want to have a church that is going to work out great, yet the New Testament holds out God as ordaining and Paul as enthusiastically going right to the heart of the mess and being like, we're putting a church right here. Now, why? Well, the most basic level, of course, because you want to see the most lost, reached with the message, the words of life of Jesus. So there's that. But additionally, I think first and second Corinthians are in the Bible to give us an example of what it looks like to persist in faith and the worship of God and doing redemptive things even when your church isn't going perfectly. There's kind of a timeless message for the ages for all churches everywhere that I think is meant to serve as an encouragement to say, your church will never be perfect. Your church will always be influenced by culture. You will have fights in church. Things will go sideways. And here are prescriptions for how to make it right and how to orient yourself to pull through those difficult times, but don't think that those difficult times just bastardize and ruin everything. God is still doing redemptive things through his church, even as the best of churches get weird and go sideways from time to time. So the timeline with Corinth is really interesting as it pertains to second Corinthians. The church was probably founded around 50 AD, the details of that are recorded in Acts 18. And then Paul writes a letter having heard about trouble in Corinth after he'd spent a bunch of time there and moved on to do other work. We don't have the text of that first actual letter we're aware of to the Corinthians. So I'm going to call that Corinthians A. That's the A letter. And it looks like that was a difficult letter meant to begin to address problems. Then we get the B letter to the Corinthians, which we call first Corinthians. This was probably written around 57 AD. And as you recall from the conversation yesterday, it was confrontational. And it pushed this church to get their stuff together, work out the things that were going wrong and reorient to the gospel. Shortly after that, we get Corinthians C, which is lost to us. We don't know really much of anything about what's in there. But we know this letter exists because Paul references it in second Corinthians as being a letter that was handed off by one of Paul's associates, Titus. And he refers to this letter as being a sharp letter. In other words, this was not an easy thing for them to hear. And Paul was confronting an ongoing church crisis. Now this church crisis looks like the whole thing unfolded over the course of about a year in 57 AD. So we have Corinthian letter A, Corinthian letter B, which is known as first Corinthians, Corinthian letter C, which is that sharp letter that Titus delivered. We don't know anything else about what was in there. And then we get to Corinthian letter D, and that is second Corinthians. And of the four, I think second Corinthians is the most optimistic because apparently Paul has got some kind of report back to him that says, hey, there was repentance. If anything, maybe over repentance and the church discipline and correction that had been carried out against the most grievous offenders within the church is maybe like Paul is saying, like, hey, that's plenty actually. We're good. Maybe you can start to restore that person with gentleness now. In the first part of the letter, chapters one through seven, Paul is like, hey, great. We're making progress. I'm encouraged to hear about all of this. And underscoring all of that first section seems to be some kind of assumption that maybe all the hardships Paul has suffered in going around and planting all of these churches on these missionary journeys is somehow to the Greek mind reflective of how the mischievous gods would punish and obstruct the old Greek heroes on their Odysseys and journeys because there was something wrong with those old heroes. And so they were inflicting a Greek understanding of these very humanized, petty gods and the great heroes of your from Greek legend. They were mistakenly inflicting that on the God of all things and imagining Paul in a Homeric sense, imagining Paul like Odysseys or something. But Paul is saying, no, it's all different here. And he points to the example of Christ and the suffering of Christ. And then Paul gestures to his own suffering. And in so many words, he's saying, I'm following the template. I'm following the example of Christ. This suffering is a badge of honor, not a mark of the punishment of God. And so it's crazy chronologically, the oldest book of the Bible might be Job. And here we are seeing one side of the conversation between Paul and a church, maybe 2000 years even after Job was written and it's people grappling with the same questions. But chapters one through seven are super positive, even celebratory. In chapters eight through nine, Paul points out the consequences of getting derailed the way they got derailed. All the other churches have put together money to prop up an impoverished church who's gone through a difficult time because of famine and other problems in Jerusalem. And so Paul's been going around gathering this offering to take back to help out the Jerusalem Christians. And Corinth hasn't really done much to contribute to that because they've been too busy cannibalizing each other and fighting. And Paul reminds them, hey, generosity is one of the things that is one of the most natural outflows of the values of the kingdom and the Christian life. And this is a place where your generosity is needed and that's something that you got to get right. Then the third section, chapters 10 through 13, Paul addresses this lingering problem that was the very first problem addressed in the previous letter of 1 Corinthians. And that is this contestation about which Christian celebrity everybody should follow. Now you go and read Paul and you see the flow of his thought and the passion of his arguments in writing and it's very impressive. But apparently Paul was not as great in person and there had been all of these other more impressive Christian teachers and celebrities who'd been showing up with letters of recommendation and needing pretty serious compensation to pay for their level of excellence. And apparently they outshined Paul in terms of personal presentation and public speaking and they never got shipped, wrecked or beaten or anything. And so a lot of these Corinthian churchgoers were like, I kind of like these other fancy new apostles who are coming down the pike. And look, even Paul's good buddy Luke at one point in the book of Acts acknowledges that Paul could kind of go on and on a little bit and it could get a little bit dry. And that comes to us in the form of Luke sharing an anecdote in the book of Acts where Paul talks way, way into the night and somebody gets so tired and bored that they pass out and fall out of a window and die and then get resuscitated and brought back to life. Some of the wildest stories in the New Testament. So Paul doesn't try to make the case that he really is the most gifted eloquent speaker in everybody should like his style the most. Rather, he points out that this dispute is dumb. And also he points to his resume. Maybe at first glance it looks like he's trying to defend himself. But when you look a little bit closer, it would appear that the reason Paul is pointing to his resume is to say like, hey, you got the gospel, the message of Jesus in the kingdom from me. And this is why the message you have is reliable. Don't deviate from it when these expensive fancy tell you what you want to hear super apostles show up and try to curry favor with you. So we wrap up the second canonical New Testament letter to the Corinthians on a pretty positive note with Paul checking his rivals with a sense that repentance has occurred. Maybe we're ready to put this crisis in the church of Corinth behind us. But also with a sense that there are still some lingering challenges and questions. And the reader of this letter is invited to celebrate the good stuff while also acknowledging this ain't perfect quite yet with them as they move on into the rest of the New Testament. So Corinth is a troubled church. It's a mixed bag. Good things happened. Weird things happened. If you've ever been a part of anything, a job, a volunteer institution, a church, a sports team, a board with you're trying to serve those kids, whatever it is, I promise you, there has been something you've experienced that makes you feel gross and icky inside where it's like, Oh, our disagreement and our politicking and our infighting feels like it just undoes all of the good that we're trying to accomplish with this good idea. But then hopefully you're able to step back from that and wash a little bit of the ick off and be like, Nope, this is the cost to do in business when you get together with other flawed people and you mix together all of our insecurities and selfish ambition and selflessness. Just weird stuff is going to happen sometimes. Hopefully you're able to look at all of the redemptive things that come out of that and see it is still a valuable endeavor even when it does get sideways. Likewise with the church, for me, one of the biggest takeaways is somebody who's worked in a church for a long time and who's felt a lot of the weirdness of church is that there is a redemptive through line even in the broken church because of the goodness of God, the presence of His Holy Spirit, the power and effectiveness of the gospel, even when things go through a difficult season and things feel very ick. The theology that that ick prompts Paul to put on display in these two letters about the nature of Christ and the Christian life and the work of the Holy Spirit, undefeatability of the church and the redemptive plan is in and of itself demonstrative of the point that God does good things even through our flawed collective efforts. When you visualize Corinthians picture people fixing a damaged church, when you think about the theme reflect on God's work in and through difficult times in church. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go read all of chapter four and the very famous chapter five verse 17 because that big pictures at all. It lifts you out of the fight and into the transcendent stuff that undergirds everything that's being said in first and second Corinthians. And with that, we have unlocked the second Corinthians achievement next time around the book of Galatians. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Galatians. Galatians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to a whole bunch of churches that he started in modern day Turkey, Asia Minor. It's probably one of the earliest letters that was written in the entire New Testament, probably one of the earliest books of the New Testament. It is meant to tackle a very specific problem that had arisen. Here's what happened. Paul went out on one of these missionary journeys and he founded a whole bunch of churches in Asia Minor. And stuff's going pretty well there. They were hard won churches. Paul took some pretty serious abuse to get those things down. He probably had the equivalent of a tattoo for each church that he founded there in the form of some sort of scar or lash or cut or injury that he took with him. And after carefully establishing these churches and establishing leaders, along come these super zealous Jewish Christians up from Jerusalem who heard a rumor that somebody somewhere wasn't acting Jewish enough and they weren't doing the whole Old Testament law. And you can't be a follower of our God if you don't do the whole Old Testament law. And so in their zeal, they go and track down somebody somewhere who still isn't doing the right thing. I think this probably had to have broken Paul's heart to an even extra degree because that's what he did. That was his mistake. He was super zealous for Jewish stuff in Jerusalem. And then he heard rumors that there were people outside Jerusalem who were still saying things that were wrong about God and he was going to go get them and imprison them and punish them. These hyper aggressive Old Testament minded Jewish Christians don't understand the Jesus thing yet. Paul is going to get them and resonate with them, but also he's losing patience with them as they go and do all kinds of damage and tear up the good things that are happening in this region of Galatia among these fledgling churches. So he writes the letter of Galatians, which would have been circulated among these churches. Maybe he wrote multiple copies. I don't know exactly how he did it, but it would have been read in public. And it's a repudiation of the teaching they're getting from these very aggressive Jewish as Paul calls them agitators who showed up to try to make the Gentile Christians obey the entire Old Testament law. And let's not be around the bush here. The particular thing that they were going to want to see happen that was the hardest dividing line between is this happening or is it not would have been the sign of the covenant with Abraham from way back in Genesis. And that is of course circumcision among the males. I mean, it's not exactly a super attractive invitation for outsiders who were thinking about signing up for church. So yeah, we can do it, but you just got to go in this little shed and we got this little thing. We roll out these instruments and you'll hear them kind of clinking stuff like a torture chamber, but we're going to do that and it's going to happen. Obviously, Paul could see that maybe wasn't the best marketing, but as Galatians unfolds, it becomes very clear that his bigger concern is that there's no life in that. That Jesus has fulfilled the law that is prompting these Jewish super Christians to come up and say, everybody needs to get circumcised and do all the law stuff. Jesus has fulfilled that. It's completed in Christ. Remember the lesson we took away from the Old Testament? We tried every single paradigm that included human effort and humans couldn't hold up their end of the bargain. We needed a new paradigm, a paradigm where all of the lift was on the shoulders of the God who wants to redeem because we're not capable of getting out of our own way. Now you Jewish Christians, you're coming up here and you're trying to inflict the thing that clearly didn't work on top of something that clearly is working. You're taking the old broken paradigm and trying to make it happen again or preserve elements of that. And so he writes this masterpiece, fast-paced letter that cuts down the argument of these Judaizers. Paul starts by defending his own leadership, much like he had to do with the Corinthian church and first and second Corinthians. He then moves on to saying that it isn't just him saying this stuff, but that Peter and the other founding apostles, they've all come to agreement on this as well, that this whole law is not something that is to be heaped on the outsiders. Now here we get an idea that this letter might have been written around 49 AD because in 50 AD there was a council in Acts chapter 15 where everybody got together and they were like, hey, we got to sort through these exact questions. They arrived at conclusions that Paul no doubt would have referenced in this letter to the Galatians if that council had already occurred. So in some ways it kind of reads like the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15 might have been part then inspired by the same stuff that inspired the book of Galatians. Well it's here at the conclusion of this opening argument that we get probably the most famous verse in Galatians. It's Galatians 2.20 where Paul beautifully says, I've been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, the life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. Moving forward, Paul accentuates the same stuff that he was really hitting back in the letter to the Romans that is all drawing on what Jesus said in the first of the five big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured. That's a sermon on the Mount. You will recall that right there at the beginning of that sermon Jesus said, don't think that I've come to abolish the law and the prophets. I haven't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. Jesus is the completion of the Old Testament story, the completion of the Old Testament sacrificial system. And then right after that you'll recall Jesus goes on to say in that famous sermon that your righteousness would have to surpass that of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Those were the people who made the rules back then in order to gain entrance to the kingdom of heaven. In other words, he's saying that to gain access to the kingdom of heaven by your own effort, you would have to be even more perfect in your behavior and conduct than you would be even if you got to write all of the rules with yourself in mind to make sure you always looked good. So what Jesus is saying is there must then be a right standing with God, a righteousness from God that is apart from human behavior, apart from the law. And that is what he's driving at here in the middle chunk of the book of Galatians. It's not about the law. Right standing with God only comes through Christ. You cannot achieve this by your own effort. And then Paul pivots to take in the Galatian churches back down memory lane, and particularly the Judaizers back down memory lane is like go all the way back to the promised Abraham. Remember, this was always to be a blessing to all the nations. All of the Old Testament anticipates that this was to go out to people like you're messing with here in Galatia in these fledgling churches. And you might be wondering, Judaizers, Jewish agitator Christian types who are here messing with other people's business. You might be wondering, why did God write the law at all then? And the answer is to point out humans inability, Paul says, to uphold the law, but also to keep things together until the arrival of the servant, the Messiah, Christ Jesus. And after this, Paul essentially does the Mr. Miyagi speech by me on the right side of the road, the left side of the road that's fine. But if you're in the middle, squish like great. Remember that famous speech from the karate kid? Well, it's the same thing here. Paul is saying you can only go all in one way or the other. You can't be part in on human effort to impress God and obtain access to the kingdom of heaven. You're either all in on the law or you are all in on depending on Christ for that righteousness. And anything other than depending on Christ to quote Mr. Miyagi once again, squish like grape, it's not going to work. Speaking of grapes, Paul wraps up the letter by saying there's certain stuff that is the product of human evil dating back to time immemorial. This stuff is inevitable. A corrupt heart separated from God cannot help but lust after these destructive things. But in contrast, there is this fruit of the spirit that cannot help but grow as God's spirit and the Christian nurture the values of the kingdom nurture the elements of the character of Christ in them and that fruit of the spirit of God in the life of Christians is beautiful. It's the stuff that everybody wants to see happen in themselves and in the world and that everybody wants for the people they love. It's love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and goodness and faithfulness and self control. And Paul says against such things, there is no law. And at this point, when he gets into the acts of the sinful nature and the very famous fruits of the spirit passage, he's kind of done talking to the Judaizers. He's already said his piece. In fact, a few verses before this fruit of the spirit stuff, he says about the Judaizers like if you're going to go the whole way in and trust the law for salvation, then why would you only cut off a little bit of skin in that nether region of your body? Why not cut off the whole thing? Paraphrase is mine. But this isn't a paraphrase. He says, as for those agitators, I wish they'd go the whole way and emasculate themselves. That is straight up in the Bible. So Galatians then is a very contentious letter. Paul is not messing around with the people who are like, well, let's go back to Egypt metaphorically. The people are like, let's go back to the old rules in the old way. I think it was working better back there. Paul is like, no, it is absolutely not working better back there. There is no life. There is no relationship or rightness with God or access to the new family of faith or access to the kingdom of God by your own work and your own merit. Rather, you are admitted to this new family of faith by the work of Christ. And after that, those good works that fruit of the spirit cannot help but grow. That is the correct order of operations because that good stuff only comes from the presence of God. It's both a fool's errand and impossible to try to combine these two approaches to access of God. Either your hope for a right relationship with God is about your impeccable behavior. You better hope you're very good. Or your hope for a right relationship with God is about the character of Christ and what he did on the cross and in the resurrection. When you picture the book of Galatians, visualize fruit for that fruit of the spirit. When you think about the theme, reflect on how Jesus completed all of the law and by doing so, made it possible for everyone to have access to this new family of faith and to his kingdom. Finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, and this is one where you've really probably ought to read the whole thing because the argument flows. Everything builds on top of what came before. But if you don't have time, make sure to read all of chapter five, which is going to take you on that dramatic swing from Paul's final spike of the football against the legalistic Judaizers, where he concludes by saying they should go the whole way in a masculine themselves. And then it swings back to the reassurance and hope that comes with the fruit of the spirit born out of a relationship with Christ, both for Jews and for Gentiles.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Ephesians. Ephesians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to the church in Ephesus, and it reads way different tonally than what we've seen in 1 Corinthians and in Galatians. It is clear that Paul thinks very highly of this church and that Paul loves this church, and that this church, unlike Corinth, has not been a pain in the butt. Instead, here he feels the opportunity to write a letter that is very forward-looking and very celebratory about what God has done and the role that they have played in it there in Ephesus and what the implications of what God has done in the distant past and in the recent past, what those implications are for whoever's reading this letter moving forward. So this is a very optimistic letter that is not all about fixing stuff that is broken and screwed up and looking backwards. This is forward, forward, forward, hope, hope, hope, and there's a reason this book of the Bible has been beloved by Christians for two millennia. Paul's relationship with the church in Ephesus, which is on the far west coast of modern-day Turkey and was a very, very prominent Greek city back in the day. Paul's relationship with this church is different than his relationship with some of the other churches we've seen where he obviously had the primary role in founding that church here. It looks like there were already Christians in Ephesus when Paul first showed up, and this is where we get introduced to the characters of Priscilla and Aquila, a couple of important Christian leaders. They were a married couple. They factored prominently in the church in Rome as well. And so in Ephesus, Paul was more joining something that already had some momentum and bringing theological clarity to it as well. And also, Paul very quickly earns his stripes in Ephesus. He's there more than once, but on one of those journeys, he runs afoul of the people who celebrate the worship of Artemis. One of the seven ancient wonders of the world was this temple to Artemis or Diana, the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. And there was this magnificent temple there. There's pretty much nothing left of it now. In fact, Ephesus in general, it's weird what happened to it. It got all silt it in at the mouth of this river. And so it ceased to become a port over several centuries, and it just gave way to ruin, which is also what happened to this famous great temple of Artemis, where there's this legend about maybe some kind of meteorite or something falling from heaven. And maybe that somehow being carved into some kind of likeness of Artemis or maybe that was Artemis, they believed or the legend that they spun falling from heaven or something like that, whatever the case, people in the ancient world bought it. And there was a whole lot of religious tourist travel pilgrimage to Ephesus where people spent a ton of money. Well, then along comes Jesus through the teachings of Paul and Aquila and Priscilla and the leaders of that community who made little idols and stuff, trinkets and stuff that you could sell at gift shops associated with the shrine of Artemis. They got really threatened and upset. And all of this is recorded in the book of Acts and Paul almost gets murdered by a mob. Just like everywhere else, Paul, I mean, say what you want about him, dude is steadfast and he's not afraid. And no doubt that steadfastness became part of the DNA of the church there. And Paul, when he's traveling around and knows that he's probably staring down his final days and walking into something calamitous in Jerusalem, he almost got a prime away from the church and Ephesus. He loves these people and he clearly views the church and Ephesus as a microcosm of what has gone right in all of history and the unfolding of the redemptive plan. And more specifically in this new paradigm, this new age of this new covenant, this new deal with Jesus after the arrival of his spirit. And in light of all of that, despite the fact that this letter was being written from a Roman prison, Paul is just so excited. It is like he's overflowing throughout this whole letter and inviting, apparently, not just the church and Ephesus, but several other churches that this letter got handed around and cycled between. He's inviting all of these Christians to pause for just a moment and reflect on what God has done, something that's never been done before. That is to create a unified people, worshiping the one true God without regard for race or ethnicity or gender or even status socially in the ancient world. Everybody is together under this one roof and Paul views that as being the completion of a whole bunch of promises from the Old Testament. He views this as being an image of the divine kingdom. This is a picture, a snapshot of foretaste of heaven because this theoretically should not happen. And I'm with Paul on this point, maybe one of the top five, top 10 greatest miracles of the whole New Testament where it seems like the laws of time and space are getting broken in crazy, visible ways left and right. Maybe one of the biggest miracles of all there is that people who should have had nothing to do with each other, divisions that ran too deep and too historically, they were incentivized to hate each other and avoid each other. They overcame all of that because the message of the gospel permeated them so greatly that it trumped all of those differences. Paul is very excited about that and is it peace despite the fact that he finds himself in very difficult circumstances. Celebrating this new family, this new paradigm, he's celebrating how God ordained this redemption from the very beginning here in the first part of the book. He's talking about how all of this is for God's glory and that he is master over how all of this is unfolded. And he further celebrates that all of it is by grace. Just look, the history of everything. It's too ugly. There's too much hurt for all of it to get worked out by people just acting a little bit nicer all of a sudden. The only way this could happen was to be undergirded by the forgiveness of God by the grace of God. And he says that it is indeed by that grace that we've been saved, whether Jewish or Gentile. Salvation isn't just a change of mind or an inclination toward being nicer. He says that we were dead, that we were deceived, fooled by the spirit of darkness in the world and that there is no way to bring ourselves to life. But then God, through Christ, made us alive and that Christians being made alive isn't just for the purpose of marveling as Paul is doing it. How awesome this story is and how amazing it is that that happened to this person and that person and that other person who's now in Christ. But he indicates that Christians are made alive in Christ for a purpose to go and do stuff that is redemptive and kingdom-oriented and representative in the world of the values and character of God who is head of this new family of faith that he has made and invited us into by no merit or no works of our own that we cannot boast. But that all of it is a celebration of the work of God and a mobilizing celebration as it compels Christians outward toward redemptive action. It is wonderful and I cannot get enough of the whole book of Ephesians, but you get quickly wrapped up in this celebratory feel and tone along with Paul, especially when you encounter Ephesians after going through the whole Bible and seeing all the ups and downs and the yucks. And because of that, it's really easy to follow his flow of thought and to pivot with him into the implication section of the book. Maybe you can call that part two where he says, look, we're one. We shouldn't be. We're unified even though we're not the same and we're coming from all these different places and we're wired differently. And then he chases this celebration of unity with sort of an expanded look at the contrast that we got at the end of the book of Galatians between the acts of this sinful nature and the fruit of the spirit. And he talks about how that both makes right relationships within society, within marriage, within family possible. But further, he points to that image of the mutual self-sacrifice between the man and a woman in marriage and talks about how that is somehow exemplary of the relationship between Christ and his bride, the church. But then Paul wraps up the letter by saying, there is something working against this beautiful new paradigm, this family of faith. And it's hardwired into everything. It's ethereal, it's institutional. It's packed into the seams and the assumptions behind everything. And further, there is a spiritual, active, evil, personal resistance to this glorious new family of faith that God is building. And the only way to stand strong against that kind of evil that undergirds all of this resistance to God is by putting on, and Paul uses a beautiful metaphor here, the full armor of God. And he goes through each of these elements of what the Christian is to equip themselves with and points out how metaphorically this is all the stuff that God gives the Christian to live in this beautiful family of faith, to live in obedience to Christ, to be an agent and an heir of the kingdom, even while having to resist this personal, active, spiritual darkness and resistance to God that exists in the world. You get to the end of Ephesians and it feels like that real old TV show called the A-Team or the leader, Hannibal Smith would grab his cigar and be like, I love it when a plan comes together. And it's like that, but probably without the cigar, I don't know. I don't think they probably had the cigars back then. When you visualize the book of Ephesians, picture armor, when you think about the theme, reflect on marveling at what God has done and considering the implication for that in the lives of Christians. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least get chapter two and make sure you also catch that armor of God stuff in chapter six versus 10 through 20. Internet high five, that's our level up on the book of Ephesians. Next time around, we got the book of Philippians. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon."}, {"meta_data": {"duration": "10:39", "episode_num": "BIBLE50", "pub_date": "Mon, 13 Mar 2023 05:03:00 +0000", "subtitle": "Thanks to everyone who supports TMBH at\u00a0 You're the reason we can all do this together!

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Philippians. The Book of Philippians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to a church he founded on his first missionary journey on mainland Europe, the mainland part of Greece, that is, in a town called Philippi. Now Philippi has got a long, long history. It goes way back in prominence to the mid 400s BC when the Macedonians, a Greek-ish people group from up north came down and conquered a bunch of Greek territory under the leadership of a guy named Philip II. And took this town, I was like, I'm going to name it after myself. So we called it Philippi. Now Philipp II died shortly thereafter, and his very famous son, after receiving a bunch of tutoring from Aristotle himself, his very famous son, Alexander the Great, took over from Philipp and then he went and conquered the entire known world and scrambled up the whole map and all the culture of everything. And so Philippi was a town that enjoyed a role of prominence for a very long time. But for some reason, and I don't think the fancy people who studied this know exactly why it fell out of prominence somewhere in the middle of the 100s BC. But then there was a gigantic incident there that put it back in the spotlight and thrust it into prominence and significance right after the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. You remember the guy who did that, right? If you want to say it out loud to impress people who are standing right there, you can do it. It's Brutus, a two-brute. Brutus and his pals square off in a great big giant Roman civil war against the people who are from the party of Julius Caesar led by Julius Caesar's godson Octavian. And they all end up at Philippi in mainland Greece, and they have a great big battle there to settle who's going to get Rome in the wake of the murder of Julius Caesar. And the winners turn out to be Octavian and Mark Antony. Now Octavian would become the first emperor of Rome. He takes on the title Caesar Augustus. He's the one who calls for the census that gets things rolling with the birth narrative of Jesus. Brutus and his forces are defeated there outside of Philippi and Brutus decides to take his own life rather than face the music for all of that. Well, at this point to signal to the world that we really don't need to fight anymore. We got this all settled up. The people who did wrong have been punished and control of the government is back where it should be. Octavian, that is Caesar Augustus, just lets a bunch of his troops quit. He's like, you did everything I asked you to do. Thank you guys so much. And he lets them colonize this somewhat dormant community of Philippi. So it's a place like Corinth that has a bunch of Greek history to it, but it becomes a Roman colony and these soldiers who get to quit the army and take a stipend and they're set for life because they helped Augustus secure Rome. I mean, they're going to love him forever and they're going to teach their kids to love the emperor and so on and so forth. And so when Paul shows up in Philippi in Acts chapter 16, he's going into a very pro-Roman city where they're going to be all in on the cult of the emperor. The emperor is a living God and the office of emperor is basically the patron of Philippi. We exist at the emperor's good pleasure. So they don't want anything that could unsettle things or mess with their standing or the great reputation and relationship they have with the throne back in Rome. But Paul holds out Jesus as being a king and as we're going to see in Colossians next time around, he holds out Jesus as being supreme over all things. And that's very threatening. So stuff doesn't go perfectly in Philippi, but a church is established there nonetheless. And it turns out that in the crucible of this difficult environment and all the pressure that is put on this church in this very pro-Roman colony of Philippi, they actually thrive. So many years later, when Paul, now a much older man, is sitting in a Roman prison, writing letters reflecting on his life, wondering if maybe this might be it for him, he is surprised and pleased to receive this beautiful gift from the people of this church. He founded clear over in Greece and Philippi delivered by a guy named a paphroditis. And apparently it was a pretty harrowing journey for a paphroditis to get there with this gift. And Paul is overwhelmed by the generosity. He's so appreciative of being remembered by the people at this church. And further, he's so grateful personally to a paphroditis that it looks like out of that joy, he sits down and pens a letter that I have read many, many, many, many times over, including multiple times in preparation for this conversation. And I still can't find the structure to it. Instead, it looks to me like he just has a handful of things that he wanted to say, born out of this heart of gratitude and a clarity that comes with maybe facing the end of life and feeling good about how you've lived. It just looks like he has some stuff that he wants to say to these people at this church who've just given him this gift that he's really grateful for. And so he tears into it and he opens by giving an extended greeting section where he talks about his own circumstances and how he is at peace with that. He famously says that to live his Christ and to die is gain. And we get a cool look inside his head as he reflects on how much he appreciates this church and also how much he appreciates what his life has looked like in Christ, whether he's got the opportunity ahead of him to go and do more stuff or whether this might be it for him as he faces possible execution in Rome. Well, from there, he doubles down on this theme of humility that runs through all of the sections in the book of Philippians. And all of that emphasis on humility is all born out of the example of Christ. And here at the beginning of chapter two, we get one of the most famous chunks of the whole New Testament in terms of poems and songs in the New Testament. It's surely one of the three or four most often quoted and celebrated and appreciated. It draws on a bunch of imagery from the Old Testament, especially deeply on the latter half of the book of Isaiah. And it's easier for me to relay the feel of it by just reading it. Most Bibles will present this, by the way, in the form of verse. So I assume it was a song or maybe a hymn that maybe Paul is even quoting here. Maybe he wrote it while he was sitting in prison. I don't know, but it's beautiful. It goes like this. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus and this is where the verse starts. Who, being in very nature, God, did not consider equality with God, something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross. Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Here we see hints of one of Paul's favorite themes and all of his writing once again that all will bow that this is for everybody. Again, that Jesus is supreme, that Jesus is doing the will of the Father is just rich, thick, creamy, center-cut Christian theology about Jesus himself right there. And then Paul goes on to say, hey, speaking of that example of humility, you know who's doing that? My protege, Timothy, you know who else is doing that? Your guy, Apaphroditis, who risked himself to bring me this gift and to encourage me and show me care when I was in this difficult situation in prison. It seems like from there, Paul flows out of what those two are getting right and says that he hopes and he feels that he's getting it right and that that example of Christ's humility has been the guidepost for how his life has been built and that all of the fancy works that he did back in the day, all of his supposed self-righteousness back when he persecuted Christians and was this great religious zealot. It's like all of that stuff is trash. It's garbage in comparison with simply having Christ. The soft-heartedness continues as apparently Apaphroditis has told Paul that there's some squabbling going on between a couple of ladies at church, a gal named Yodia and another lady named Sintakey. And Paul just peaceably appeals for them in light of all of these bigger, better, more important things to work that out and find peace together. And then he rounds out his thoughts again, like a guy who's made peace with this maybe being the end by saying that he's found the secret to contentedness and surprise. The secret to that is in Christ. When you visualize the book of Philippians, picture a surprise gift for a prisoner. When you think about the theme, reflect on Christ's humility and example. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go back and read chapter two verses six through 11 for yourself. Hey, one other tip on the way out the door. These books right here, Galatians and Ephesians, the last two we looked at, and then Philippians today and Colossians, which we have next time around. There's a little acronym to keep these straight that I have always used. And it's very helpful for remembering what order these go in. It's simply go eat popcorn, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians. If you didn't know that one already, I think it's going to make your life better. That's it Philippians leveled up.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Colossians. The Book of Colossians is another one of these letters is written by the Apostle Paul to a specific church. In this case, it's the church at Colossae. That's where Colossians are from. Then this is how a lot of the books that make up the middle of the New Testament are. These letters, these epistles. But this one stands out as being a little bit different because here Paul is writing to a church that he did not found and where he doesn't seem to know anybody. He says one point of contact with this church, and it's this pal of his named Apaphris. I don't know if I'm saying that right. E-P-A-P-H-R-A-S. You can pronounce that now however it makes sense to you. We don't know exactly how Paul knows Apaphris. Maybe they were in prison together, some people think, or maybe Apaphris visited him in prison. Whatever the case, Paul is in prison as he is writing this letter in Rome. And he has heard somehow about what's going on half a world away out in Asia Minor, modern day Turkey, at this little church in Colossae. And it doesn't sound like things are going very well. And so Paul is going to assert himself a little bit as the apostle to the Gentiles here to try to give some guidance to this church full of people who probably know of him, but don't know him. Now Colossae was a pretty significant city for a very, very long time. And it still had a long future ahead of it historically after this letter got delivered. It still had another thousand plus years of thriving, or maybe I should say hanging on before it finally got gobbled up by the comings and goings of history. But looking backwards Colossae was hundreds, maybe thousands of years old by the time Paul is writing this letter. It was well positioned along trade routes, so it would have factored in multiple empires who had come and gone and how they did business around Asia Minor or modern day Turkey. And Paul passed by there very, very closely on at least one of his trips. Maybe he passed through town, but it doesn't look like he did any kind of church activity there. It looks like the church thing happened there as a secondary effect perhaps of the very significant Christian growth in the city of Ephesus. Now Ephesus is on the west coast of Asia Minor on the Aegean Sea. And as I understand it, it's about a week's walk from Colossae. So Colossae is seven days straight east of Ephesus. Paul hints at another point in the Bible that the thing at Ephesus, which is the church that he loved, he hints at it went so well there that it had a ripple effect in surrounding areas. And so it seems pretty likely that Colossae is a result of what had happened there in Ephesus. Well, Colossae being at the intersection of all kinds of major highways and trade routes through multiple empires that had come and gone would mean that they would have to be very adaptive religiously to get along so well with so many different empires. They would have to do a great job of synthesizing and integrating religious beliefs from all kinds of different people in a way that wasn't threatening for the sake of doing business. Think about the way the messaging in modern media and storytelling has become more and more safe and mundane and un-nuanced, believe in yourself, don't be mean. Think about the way that has happened over the last 20 or 30 years as more and more businesses have tried to market into all corners of the world and trying to appease every cultural sensibility on earth all at the same time, even ones that are diametrated. And ones that are diametrically opposed, it makes for pretty thin, uncompelling, non-offensive milk toast storytelling. Well, it seems like in Colossae that was what was happening with religion and social norms, just a dash of this, a dash of that. Greek thought could accommodate that. You just could add a new God to the Greek cosmology of gods and they'd just be the God of this or the God of that. What sounds like the Christians in Colossae were tempted on the one hand to try to do that with Jesus. Imagine him to be a very impressive new God, the one that they would most worship. They'd be kind of like the cult of Jesus, but understand that there are cults of other things as well and those other groups might have a point. But then on the other hand, they were also under pressure in the same way that the Galatian Church, this would be the neighboring region to where Colossae is, in the same way that the Galatian Church was under pressure from those Judaizers, those Jewish Christians who came up north and they were like, no, you got to do all the Jewish stuff. You got to eat the food the same way we eat it. You got to do the festivals the same way we do it. You got to get all those adult men circumcised. That way everybody will know that they are doing the ancient covenant that God gave to Abraham to show that these are people who are set apart and holy for God. As soon as the knives come out, just like in Galatia, I'm sure the people of Colossae were like, maybe somebody should contact Paul and find out. It seems like kind of final before we actually start cutting on things. Maybe we just figure out how the religion is actually supposed to work and just make sure. So I imagine, or maybe it's kind of fun to imagine, that that is the occasion. That is what prompted the reach out to Paul in the first place. Maybe it was just a paphorous and he felt concerned for his home church and he contacted Paul in prison. Either way, Paul graciously agrees to write this letter to a bunch of people he doesn't know to encourage them regarding the uniqueness, the singularity and the supremacy of Christ. To say, Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. You don't need to do the rules that the Judaizers are trying to get you to follow. You got to do that stuff. But further, Jesus is not a God among many gods. Those are all fake gods. This is the one true God. He is the image of the invisible God, the real one. So don't integrate any of that other stuff at all. Just Christ plus nothing. That's the way you got to go. And he executes that in this letter to the Colossians by opening in the normal way with greetings and an expression of thanks for the good things. He's heard about what's going on there. But then he gets down to business by opening with one of the most important theological tour de forces of the entire New Testament in chapter 1 verses 15 through 23. And I could try to summarize it all, but you know, it would be faster and better would be to just read it. But as I read it here, have your antenna out for all of the ways that Paul is overtly and subtly saying you don't need all of this other stuff. Christ reigns supreme. He is over and above all else. Okay. Starting in verse 15. He that is Christ is the image of the invisible God, the first born over all creation. For by him, all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities. All things were created by him and for him. He's before all things and in him, all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning and the first born from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy for God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood shed on the cross. Now he pivots into the implications of that very briefly. Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your mind because of your evil behavior, but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you wholly in his sight without blemish and free from accusation. If you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you have heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. We almost don't even really need to cover anything else in this book because you get it. That is the thesis statement. That is the theology that undergirds all of this. That should be enough in and of itself to clarify all the other questions that are plaguing the Christians here in Colossae. From here on out, the rest of the book really is just Paul saying in light of that, this is pretty obvious. And so the next section is reminiscent of what we got back in Galatians, the stuff about the Judaizers coming up north and trying to make everybody do Jewish things. In order to be a Christian and signal that they were part of the family of God, Paul's response is shorter and simpler here. But the gist is, again, that Jesus is the fulfillment of all of that stuff and that God has made a new family of faith and replaced the old dead heart. They can't help itself with a new life and a new heart that is in Jesus, made alive in Jesus. And this multi-ethnic family was always the plan going all the way back to Abraham. And indeed, if Jesus is the true God who is supreme over all else, supreme over rulers and authorities and thrones and culture and religion and everything else, then such a God who is ruler of all the world and all the peoples must be represented in the church. This always had to be a multi-ethnic, multicultural family of faith or else it's just another regional God. But this isn't just another regional God. This is the real one, the actual one. The point is Christ Jesus, God in the flesh is the chief reality. Indeed, he holds creation, existence and reality together as its author and as its sustainer. And therefore, he defines what reality is and that trumps even the things that the people in Colossae might imagine were the bedrock of social assumptions. No, Christ is the foundation and the bedrock of social assumptions according to Paul in this book. When you visualize the book of Colossians, picture Jesus, the image of the invisible God, when you think about the theme, reflect on the nature and the supremacy of Jesus. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go back and read chapter 1 verses 15 through 23 a few times over for yourself. And with that, congratulations on leveling up Colossians next time around 1 Thessalonians. I'm Matt, this is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 1 Thessalonians. 1 Thessalonians is another one of these letters written by the Apostle Paul to a church that he founded. In this case, that church is in Thessalonika, which is a super ancient, very Greek city that had played a role in all kinds of the comings and goings and warfare and politics of the ancient Greek world and the dealings with the Persians when they came and went. So this town is a big deal. It's a very cosmopolitan. There are people from all over the world who live there, and there's also a Jewish synagogue there. Paul's second missionary journey, which is recorded in part in Acts chapter 17, Paul and his buddy Silas show up in Thessalonika, and apparently they do what they were doing at any of these towns where there was a Jewish presence. They went first to the synagogue, and they would reason there with the Jewish people. Paul spoke their language both literally and figuratively, and it says that in Thessalonika there was a pretty good response. Some of those Jews were persuaded that their Messiah had indeed arrived. The promised king of David is here, the one who would crush the head of the serpent, promised all the way back in the beginning of Genesis. He has arrived. God's spirit will now dwell among us, and so they were going to be pretty excited. But a lot of other Jewish people weren't as excited about it more on that in a minute. In addition to that, Acts chapter 17 tells us that a bunch of God-fears, those being people who believed that the God of the Jews was the real God, but they weren't Jewish ethnically themselves, says a bunch of them signed up to follow Christ as well. Then it also says that a whole bunch of Gentiles signed up to follow Christ as well, and then it also says that more than a few very prominent women leaders in the community became Christians as well. This all happened very, very quickly, maybe in 49 or 50 AD. But then the story takes a turn and echoes the same stuff that happened back in Jerusalem with Jesus. A bunch of the Jewish people who did not acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah there in Thessalonica, they round up some people and create a riot, and they go and they say to the magistrates and the leaders that the same thing that happened to Jerusalem is happening here. This Jesus fellow was claiming to be a rival king to Caesar, and we can't have that. Now, this is just as disingenuous in Thessalonica as it was back when it happened to Jesus in Jerusalem. The Jews did not like Rome, and they certainly didn't acknowledge the Roman emperor as the Roman emperor thought of himself as a God. They threw riots over stuff like this. They threatened mass public ritual suicide in front of the governor's office in Caesarea over something that just looked like the image, the portrait of the emperor being too close to the temple. No, and to their credit, the Jews took idolatry very, very seriously, and they were not fans of the emperor in this regard. So the accusations that are given thrown at Jesus and now at Paul from the Jewish people, that comes off as really disingenuous. But it's enough to create all kinds of political pressure. Paul has to flee. Silas stays put. What all of this means is that Thessalonica was a church founded in turmoil. It was born out of immediate resistance. And further because of this, their training was incomplete. They didn't get a year or two years like Corinth or Ephesus got. They just got a tiny little bit of time before Paul had to get out of there. So it shouldn't come as a surprise then that Paul felt compelled to write to the Thessalonian church very quickly after he was gone from there to continue to nurture them and encourage them because he understood what they were giving up to follow Jesus. This was very, very costly. There's this thing that we see happen again and again through the early age of Christianity where these Roman emperors would want to assert the cult of themselves from time to time. And they'd be like, I don't like all these other rival deities. We're going to do a thing where we just make everybody go and burn some incense in the pagan Roman religious practice to me, a living God. And you do that for, you know, solidarity and unity in the empire to say, hey, we're all in it together. Just make this one public gesture, even if it doesn't make sense to you and even if it doesn't really do anything, make this gesture to show that we're together on this. Even if you worship a different God, come on, it's not that big a deal. It's just a pinch of incense. Just do the pinch of incense. Why are you making it such a big thing? And in the first few hundred years of Christianity, some Christians were like, yeah, it's just a pinch of incense, whatever. Let's just show that we're all in it together. Fine. Here you go. Others were like, no, it's idolatry and I don't acknowledge that God and I'm not going to do it. And generally speaking, they suffered terribly for refusing to do that. But for you and me living so far after this point in history, we can look at that and be like, why it's just it doesn't matter. Like who cares if you twizzle together some flakes of something that smells good over a little piece of fire in some dumb building that doesn't know who cares. But my friends, when you think about the things that go on in the world today, you know that stuff means stuff. And from time to time, culture gets an idea in its head and it's like, hey, we need to see this to know that you're normal and that you're in on our thing. Even if that thing is complete double speak or laughable dishonesty. This isn't just an ancient world thing. This isn't just an us thing. This is a human culture thing. Well, along comes Paul with the message of Jesus and Thessalonica and the mere existence of the claims of Christ when lined up against all of the convenient lies and myths that they tell each other there. It undermines all of that and it is a threat to it. So in that regard, I suppose the Jewish agitators were somewhat right in their accusation. Thus, the occasion for this letter, it's not a real long one. All we're getting here content wise is half of the letter with Paul just saying how grateful he is that this church exists and acknowledging that he understands how costly it was for the people who founded this church and became a part of it to do so. He essentially acknowledges the pain of the relationships they lost and the social cost of that, but then points to the relationship that he has with them and they have with each other and other Christians in this new family of faith. Any points to the transcendence of that in the second half of the letter, Paul is addressing the pressures they're going to continue to feel. They're right there in the hotbed of Greek and Roman thought. They're not participating in any of the convenient cultural lies anymore. That makes people irrationally angry and hateful toward them. They have voluntarily become the repugnant cultural other to their neighbors. In this second part, Paul is saying you're going to feel pressure to do things that look like the things your neighbors do that make sense for them in light of their assumptions about the world, but that don't make sense for you in light of your assumptions about the world rooted in Christ. You're going to do things differently when it comes to sexuality and he paints a picture of right marital monogamous relationships. Further, he goes on to say that they're set apart for good works like he was talking about back in the book of Ephesians and that generosity is part of that. They're going to need to look out for each other and be generous to people in need. Both of these cultural distinctives are going to flow out of the assumptions that come with being a follower of Jesus. Then there's an obvious question that Paul needs to address in the second half of this book. I mean, hey, we're changing what we do. We're living differently from our neighbors. That's going to be very costly. When does this whole thing shake out where Jesus comes back? What about those of us who've already died before Jesus returned? It seems like they were very curious about that and understandably so. We get the sense throughout the New Testament that people were really anticipating Jesus coming back within their lifetimes and they're being a reckoning for all of this injustice and ugly stuff that had been inflicted on them. But as we know at this point, it didn't happen in that timeframe. This is one of the places where Paul speaks to that and he talks about this Old Testament and idea of the day of the Lord. And in the same way that the Old Testament prophets looked way forward to say, there is a grand day of the Lord coming. So Paul looks forward to say there is a grand day of the Lord coming when this stuff will get sorted out and when the dead in Christ will be raised. He talks about literal resurrection and participating in this glorious day of the Lord, the reckoning, the return of Christ, the second coming of Christ. I'm sure that sounded both very foreign to that original audience, but also wildly encouraging to that original audience and very much in keeping with the themes that had been developed and that are still hanging out there from the Old Testament. No doubt people were like, cool, can you give us the time when that's going to happen though? So we can just set our pace and endure up to that point. But in response to that implicit question, Paul echoes the words of Jesus in Matthew 24 saying, we don't know the day or the hour when all of this stuff is going to happen. And then he takes that to its logical conclusion. And in so many words says, therefore we're going to live expectantly like that day of the Lord is now like that day of the Lord is always happening. The knowledge that this return is coming has to inform how we live in the interim. So again, at the simplest level, the first half of the book is Paul thanking God for the faithfulness of this fledgling Thessalonian church. And the second half of the book is Paul praying for the love and steadfastness and set up heartedness from the pressures of the culture for the people there in Thessalonica as they expectantly await the return of Christ. When you visualize the book of first Thessalonians, picture Paul's description of Jesus descending from heaven. When you think about the theme, reflect on responding to the world's pressures with hopeful, expectant living. And if you don't have time to check out the whole thing, make sure you at least read chapter four. Let us congratulate each other. We have leveled up our first Thessalonians game and unsurprisingly, we have second Thessalonians next time around. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon."}, {"meta_data": {"duration": "12:59", "episode_num": "BIBLE53", "pub_date": "Thu, 16 Mar 2023 04:00:00 +0000", "subtitle": "Thanks to everyone who supports TMBH at\u00a0 You're the reason we can all do this together!

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day and this one is about 2 Thessalonians. We're going to talk about 2 Thessalonians in just a minute, but before we do, I thought of a trick that I use to keep straight all of these books that start with the letter T that are all clumped together in the middle of the New Testament. Every book that starts with the letter T is together in a row, 5 of them. Then the way you can remember what order they appear in is that they're all alphabetical. First and second Thessalonians is T-H. First and second Timothy, that's T-I, and then Titus, which is also T-I is T-I-T-U-S. So it comes last. Look at that, they're in alphabetical order. Now you'll always remember where all of the T books go and what order they appear in. Second Thessalonians though. We talked in our last conversation about Acts 17, where we get the story of how Paul founded the church in Thessalonica and the immediate challenges he was confronted there and how their training was incomplete because Paul had to flee to keep from getting killed. So Paul moves on relatively quickly to Corinth, where he writes back a couple of letters to these Christians in Thessalonica. So the memory is still fresh for him of what's going on there. And it would appear that the two big problems that are facing the church in Thessalonica, problems Paul probably would have worked through with them in person if he'd been able to stay longer, are one, that they are becoming cultural outcasts because of how weird the way they live is compared with the way that the people of Thessalonica live, the people in that town, just have completely different values sexually and in terms of family and in terms of how they do culture and relationships and money and generosity or lack thereof. They have a totally different way of coming at things, undergirded by a totally different set of assumptions than these new Christians do. And it's become very costly for them. So in first Thessalonians, Paul deals with a whole bunch of those concerns, but he also touches on the idea that things are going to be okay because you can live expectantly and with hope about the fact that Jesus is coming back. Things are not done. There's an end game to all of this era of the church and your suffering is in keeping with the life of Christ and it is not in vain. Well, that gets us in to the second thing that seems to have troubled the young Thessalonian church. And that is, well, that question of when? Okay, Jesus is coming back. You say, Paul, that's awesome. We're very, very for that sooner would actually be better. Things are not going very well here. We're under all kinds of pressure. And so what we see is the Thessalonians not being thoroughly briefed on how all of history is to unfold. They get into something that has been a very popular Christian pastime ever since. And that is speculation about facts and figures and charts and numbers and dates in the pursuit of a precise read on exactly when this ultimate day of the Lord is going to come and when Christ is going to return in the fashion that Paul described in first Thessalonians. So very quickly, after writing first Thessalonians, Paul is like, Oh, dang, I heard some more stuff about what's going on there in Thessalonica. I got to write you second Thessalonians to help you out with what you're facing right now. But before we look at the structure of the book, just a quick side note. Think about what we learned back when we were talking about first and second Corinthians and how difficult things were in that city. And I'll think about the fact that Paul left one type of very difficult situation in Thessalonica to go to a very different type of very difficult situation in Corinth. And he's trying to help the people in Corinth while he's also trying to write a letter to the chaos that's happening in Thessalonica. This guy had a hard job. He was doing something dangerously countercultural in very hostile territory and trying to think outside of the immediate context of the hostile territory he was in to help other Christians in other hostile territory that he was in. And so when we run into those passages in Paul's letters where he's pretty forceful, pretty direct, pretty quick about things and pretty blunt, maybe even pretty impatient with bad ideas and destructive things, all of that stuff makes a lot more sense when you consider who he was and what he was doing. And the Bible never holds out Paul the man as being infallible. Christians don't believe that Paul or Peter or anybody was infallible. Everybody other than Christ has problems as flaws is sinned and fallen short of the glory of God as is written in the book of Romans. And Paul is no exception. So the fact that we see the earnestness of his heart as he's tackling a lot of these situations sometimes very bluntly and with a lot of rough edges just speaks to the difficulty of this role. And like he was told by Jesus when he met the risen Christ on the road to Damascus, he was going to suffer a lot for this thing. And indeed we see Paul as being a guy who is well acquainted with turmoil and difficulty. All right, back to the letter though of 2 Thessalonians. The first chapter of the book echoes the first half of 1 Thessalonians. Paul once again saying, Hey, I cannot express properly how grateful I am to God for you and for your steadfastness and that you're hanging in under difficult circumstances. You are a blessing. He just really props them up and they deserve it because they're taking a beating and they are suffering in a way that has echoes of how Christ suffered. That happens when the kingdom you're loyal to isn't of this world a polisherism that this reality that they're going through right now is not the ultimate forever reality. Then in chapter 2, Paul draws heavily on the language and style of language that Jesus uses in Matthew 24. That's the fifth of the five great big speeches around which the book of Matthew is built. Someone just called the Olivet Discourse and it's a speech that Matthew gave about how the future of things is going to unfold. Well, makes sense that Paul would tap into that stuff from Jesus because that's one of the big questions the church in Thessalonica clearly had. And Paul talks about the arrival of this man of lawlessness. And here it's apparent that Paul has heard about some people in his name, in Paul's name going out and saying, we missed it. The day of the Lord has already happened. We all got left. Things are very, very bad. We missed it. Panic time. And Paul is like, no, I did not say that. That is not what you were taught. That is not what Jesus taught. And then once again, he leans into the words of Jesus by saying, a bunch of world stuff is just going to happen. And that's the tone of the beginning of the Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24. Jesus is talking to a group of people, his disciples who are like, say, so when is all this going to unfold? Because we kind of want to know how to pace ourselves for the same questions that Thessalonians are asking. And Jesus is like, hey, there's going to be a bunch of stuff that happens. You're going to see crazy natural phenomenon, political phenomenon, violence, persecution. And in so many words, Jesus is telling his disciples that is just the broken world doing stuff that the broken world is going to do. Those are no sure signs of the end of things or the day of the Lord or the return of the Son of Man. Just keep on in faithfulness. And then later in that fifth great speech around which the Book of Matthew is structured, Jesus gets into stuff about like when we're really getting close to the time when the Son of Man, that's Jesus, is actually going to return. So Paul here says, there's this man of lawlessness who has to come before any of this end of time stuff is going to occur. Some people who are real smart, look at that passage and they're like, ah, the man of lawlessness, that must be one particular character who is dangerous. Maybe it's like the Antichrist or some sort of Antichrist, a political leader, a military ruler, and many people throughout history have speculated, ah, it's Hitler. It's King George III. It's the evil dictator of this place or that place. And all of that timeline wise has turned out to be flawed speculation. So maybe the man of lawlessness is one dude who's going to come along. He was just so genuinely horrible that he will initiate horrible awful things in the whole world and everybody will see it. And when you see that, you better get out of town if you can, because it's going to get ugly. Or maybe the man of lawlessness as a concept is an echo of what Jesus is talking about in Matthew 24. And that is the template, the archetype of puffed up arrogant kings who imagine they control all of the world and control reality, but they don't. Maybe there's just a whole lot more general evil lawlessness like we see from some of the evil kings of the Old Testament who were humbled before God that has to happen and unfold smart people disagree on how much specificity should be read into that man of lawlessness thing. But the point is real straightforward. Paul is saying it hasn't happened yet. The rumblings that you're feeling are the natural consequences of the fallen broken sinful world you still live in. Hold fast, stand firm, live expectantly and hopefully in light of the promise of Christ's return. And in so many words, you're saying your speculation is not particularly helpful. And it's not even in keeping with what Jesus taught. Paul said that in 1 Thessalonians and Jesus said that explicitly in that same speech I keep referencing back to in Matthew 24 and 25. Well, then in chapter three, we've got a problem that may be connected to the previous problems. And Paul needs to address it or maybe it's unrelated, but I think it's connected to the previous problems. People quit working in the church. They weren't doing this like going to work and earning money in order to have food. Looks like they were just running around, running their mouths and being idle and not accomplishing things. And in light of what we see in the rest of 1 Thessalonians, I think it's pretty reasonable to conclude that they were doing so because they believed that the end of days, the day of the Lord, the return of Christ had either already happened or it was going to happen like next Thursday. And we had it all figured out we had charts and facts and figures and we know how it's going to be. Whatever is prompting this idleness, it isn't in keeping with that expectant, hopeful living that Paul is exhorting them toward. And so he says, knock it off with that stuff. And people should work. And Paul puts his money where his mouth is by pointing to the way he lived while he was there saying, look, I worked while I was among you. I did stuff I earned my keep. And implicitly, the question he's asking is why would I do that if I secretly knew about the arrival of Jesus in the specific day of the Lord, I would have been coasting too. But my example isn't just because I'm the best guy ever. The reason I'm pointing to that example is because my conduct proves to you what I actually believe and received from Jesus that the day of the Lord, the day of the return of Christ is unknown. I feel bad for this little church. This is a tough draw for them. But I all the more respect their faithfulness, even from 2000 years across the ages, I find it encouraging and challenging. They didn't know everything. They didn't have everything together. They were very much doing the walk by faith in Christ thing under very difficult circumstances. And Paul's trying to help him out from a distance. And one of the byproducts of all of that is that we get a couple of beautiful, if very succinct books of the Bible that touch on some important questions that naturally Christians throughout the ages are going to ask. When you visualize the book of 2 Thessalonians, picture that man of lawlessness. When you think about the theme of 2 Thessalonians, reflect on that expectant hopeful living as a right response to the coming return of Jesus versus the wrong responses to the coming return of Jesus that are out there. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you check out chapter 2. I'm going to ask my friend Jeffrey who edits this podcast to cue the level up sound right now as we anticipate 1 Timothy next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about First Timothy. As we turn the page here from 2 Thessalonians over to First Timothy, there is an ever-so-subtle shift in genre that is occurring. All of the letters of Paul we've seen so far have been letters to churches, Romans 1 and 2 Corinthians, then go eat popcorn, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and then 1st and 2nd Thessalonians. All of those open with some version of Paul and Apostle of Christ, because I'm enthusiastic about your church and I want to obey God. I write to the church in Corinth. I mean, it's a very ugly paraphrase, but they all start something like that. Well, First Timothy opens the same. Paul and Apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God, our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, our hope. All right, that's all pretty familiar. We read on to Timothy, my true son, in the faith. Aha! There's the wrinkle of difference. We are moving out of the letters of Paul that are written to churches, and we're moving into a new chunk of letters that are written to church leaders or people in churches, giving them guidance about how to lead or how to play their role in the church. And the first of these pastoral epistles, as they're often called, is written to Paul's protege, Timothy. Timothy is representative of, I guess you could say, generation 3 of Christianity. It's generation 1, as the people who Jesus met in physical person during his pre-crucifixion lifetime. And then generation 2 are the Christians who came after Jesus' death and resurrection. Well, then generation 3 would be the people that generation 2 reached. And that is what happened with Timothy, because during Paul's second missionary journey, he makes a trip through central Turkey. This is probably in the late 40s AD. And he goes to this one town called Lystra, where he meets a family that includes this young man, Timothy. And Timothy is half Jewish and half Greek. That in and of itself makes him a very versatile player in this whole go-reach people journey that Paul is on. Everywhere he goes, he's talking to Jews and Greeks. That's how he's approaching it. So here's Timothy. Somebody who's promising and who Paul decides he can deeply invest in. This turned out to be an excellent intuition on Paul's part, because Timothy kicks butt. He's fantastic. He is reliable. He is teachable. And he matures into a great Christian leader. Timothy is along for the ride and learns a whole bunch about how church works and about what Paul is going for and about what God's Holy Spirit is doing. And at the time, first Timothy gets written, this guy's not really a kid anymore. He's been doing this for over a decade. He knows his way around. He's got a reputation. And that's why when Paul hears about trouble in his beloved Church of Ephesus, where he's invested so much time, he picks Timothy from his team of people he works with to be the guy who addresses those problems. And it takes a little bit of a pep talk because Timothy is stepping up a level in responsibility here. And so the tone that we get in first Timothy differs from the tone that we get in all of those letters that are written to churches that are going to be read aloud to a big diverse grand audience. Even more candid tone than what we get there. Paul has never wanted to mince words, but he's really not minceing words with Timothy. He is cutting right to the chase on things to do his very best to set his protege and this church he loves in Ephesus up for success. Well, it looks like the problem in Ephesus is that this church has become literally confused and metaphorically fat and a little bit self satisfied and a little bit missing the point. That's what Paul wants Timothy to do is to confront some of the excesses, the abuses, some of the false teaching that is starting to take root. Some of the weird pride stuff that is starting to manifest that is causing chaos and that is making the church an Ephesus look dumb and ineffective and like it's driven by world kingdom values in front of all the other people in the city of Ephesus who aren't Christians yet. Paul is specifically commissioning and equipping Timothy to solve the immediate problems of the Ephesian church and to settle in for the long haul. You guys are going to be a church here for a while. So you've got to live right in this community. You've got to be as Jesus says in Matthew chapter five at the beginning of the first of the five big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured the sermon on the Mount. As Jesus says there, you got to be salt and light. Timothy, go explain to the Ephesians that they got to be salt and light. They've got to be a pointer or representative, a preservative, a flavoring, an insertion of kingdom values in the middle of world darkness in that city where they are strategically positioned by God to represent his kingdom. Well, the way the book plays out is we start off by getting a sense of some of these false teachers and it looks like they're dipping back selectively into Old Testament stuff that they don't understand. They're just butchering it. And surely Paul is someone who probably had the whole Bible memorized given his training is here in the arguments that these clowns are making. He's probably just face Paul and thinking, oh my goodness, that is amateur hours bushy garbage. If he were there, it'd be really easy to just knock over these idiotic arguments. But instead he has to pump up Timothy to go and do that because Paul cannot be there at this time. Well, these guys are saying that there should be all kinds of dietary restrictions inflicted on everybody and that somehow their weird read of the Old Testament says that marriage should be abolished. We just shouldn't do that anymore. And we find out a little bit later on that much like the mistakes that were being made in Thessalonica that here in Ephesus, these clown teachers are also saying, oh, the resurrection. That stuff already happened. We missed it. So in response to that, in the early going of this first letter from Paul to Timothy, Paul is going to say, no, that's not what the Old Testament says. It's not what the Old Testament does. Paul's already made this point in other letters we've encountered in the Bible. But he's saying, no, the Old Testament points out the failure of humanity. It points out our sin and it points us toward our need for Jesus. That's what it does. If you read that in a Christian context and you come away saying that all marriage should be dissolved or abolished, you are totally missing the point. Then Paul is saying to Timothy, once you've dealt with this stupid teaching and the stuff that doesn't make any sense, you've got to tackle the things that are causing chaos in the church and that make everybody look bad. And that gets us into a passage that has caused much controversy over the years where Paul talks about certain women in this church who are also missing the point, but in a different way than those male false teachers from before. They are wearing extravagant, elaborate, decadent clothing in a church where super poor people also attend. And it looks like with no qualification or knowledge whatsoever, they are using their uppity status socially in the community and their wealth as a justification to go up to the front and teach people whatever their ideas are. And those are also destructive and missing the point. So Paul says a bunch of stuff about how he doesn't allow women to teach. And he supports this position he holds by pointing back to imagery from the garden and the sin of Adam and Eve and how that all unfolded. Through the years, people have looked at this passage and said, the language of the text is clear. This is universal. What Paul is telling Timothy to do is how it is supposed to be in all churches for all time. Other people look at that and say, yeah, but Priscilla is one of the founding teachers and leaders in this church. And like the whole Ephesus Church kind of in part exists because of stuff that she did. So maybe Paul is saying something that is more specific to the behavior of these women and their teaching. I am going to excuse myself from settling that one in this brief conversation, but I will offer this last word. How people tend to read that passage and what they tend to do with it seems to correspond very closely to whatever presuppositions we bring to the text. I encourage you to dig deeper on that question for yourselves and grace and peace to everybody understanding that I will not live long enough to see ultimate agreement on some of these questions that come out of these parts of the Bible. However you understand it to be best to extrapolate that text out to the larger church. What is crystal clear is Paul is saying we got two different recipes for chaos and insanity coming from the men of the church, coming from certain women in the church and both of these things are problems and Timothy, come on man, you got to handle this. You've got this. This is what you were made for. This is what you've been training for. I know it's not going to be easy. Those are very fancy, very rich, very intimidating women and they're not going to make it easy for you. And those men who are false teachers butchering the Old Testament, they are loud. They are aggressive. It's going to be tough as a young man, but don't get intimidated. Don't let them look down on you because you're young. You are on the side of what is right here. It is your job to bring truth and clarity and peace to this church. So it is built for the long haul and you got this thing. And it's a good thing that Paul is giving him that encouragement because there's a laundry list at the end of the book, stuff that he is supposed to go and tackle. And again, this letter is very candid, very direct. As Paul is writing to someone he is very invested in and to someone who very much knows Paul's thinking and dance steps, he's really cutting right to the chase about what the problems are. And indeed so much so that he even names names of some of these false teachers at different points. Further, Timothy is going to need the support because he's supposed to gently and deftly confront some of the older men in the church who apparently have gotten into public drunkenness. But Paul goes out of his way to make sure Timothy understands like I'm not saying that any kind of wine or alcohol is prohibited. Probably there were some people arguing that. In fact, Paul seems to be taking into account the stress or maybe even ulcers that the pressure of all of this might cause Timothy. He's like, take a little wine. It might help settle your stomach. And I think that little personal admonition was a very intentional shrewd move on the part of Paul so that Timothy would not mistake this correction that needed to happen over this public drunkenness for an out and out prohibition. Further, Paul commissions Timothy to go and shrewdly deftly address some of the imbalances in the relationship between servants, bond servants and their household masters, even slaves and their household masters. Now Paul's agenda has always been to call out slavery and point to the reality of the family of faith as nullifying that as trumping those social relationships. Slaves are just as much a brother or sister in the family of Christ as anybody else regardless of what Roman paperwork and legal status might say. And Paul demands excellent treatment, brotherly and sisterly relationships, even in households that do have servants and slaves. But he's clever. If he goes out and attacks the entire institution of slavery overtly and publicly, you become an enemy of Rome and they are going to crush your movement with violence and force before it can get off the ground. So Paul is condemning slavery, undercutting slavery, but he's doing so very shrewdly and he's inviting Timothy to thread that needle along with him. I guess maybe Timothy better take a sip of that wine here or there to call him his stomach. This letter really does strike a very different conversational tone than what we've seen in the letters that Paul was right into the different churches. And the Bible and Christianity are better for it because we're getting this inside look at a proper strategic approach to what a community of faith is to be internally and what it is to be externally. When you visualize the book of 1 Timothy picture, young Timothy confronting the Ephesian church, that should be the kind of thing that you can conjure an image of in your mind. When you think about the theme reflect on how kingdom values informed church honors God, but it also witnesses to outsiders. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get chapter 4 verses 6 through 16. Achievement unlocked first Timothy. There we go. Second Timothy next time around.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Second Timothy. Second Timothy is the last letter we're aware of that Paul ever wrote, and it reads like it. It's heavy, it's weighty, it's human, it's emotional, there's a passing of the baton, and also there's a piece to it. Paul feels good about what he used his life on. He still doesn't think, even as he's sitting in this freezing cold Roman prison, he still doesn't think that there's anything better he could have used his time on, and he's exhorting the recipient of the letter, young Timothy, his protege, to see it the same way and to follow suit. The guy who taught me the Old Testament and first introduced me deeply to the idea that the Bible was rooted in history and said in history, real people, real places, real times. The first time that history and academics really overlapped with the Bible for me was in this guy's classes in my undergraduate education. His name was Samir Masu, he was a Lebanese dude, he was phenomenal in terms of his abilities, in terms of his talent for communication, and in terms of his personal conduct, how he treated people. I deeply, profoundly respected this guy, and just a couple years back, I called him with some questions about the Bible for things you and I talk about here, and I could sense in his voice that he was not doing well. I found out later that he was very, very sick when we had spoken. We talked, he offered me some really helpful feedback that made its way again into the conversation you and I had, and then as we're getting ready to jump off the phone, he totally switched gears, completely different tone. I don't know if it was off the cuff or if he thought about it in advance or if maybe he had done this with some other people in his life, but he gave me this incredibly meaningful blessing and commissioning. I didn't see it coming. Fortunately, I had the good sense to just keep my mouth shut and listen very closely to try to receive it. And then we say goodbye, and that was the last time I ever talked to him. He passed away shortly thereafter. It feels like what we're getting in 2 Timothy is that same kind of thing. It's a closing blessing, it's a closing exhortation, it's a taking of the baton, and a handing off of that to say, now you take it and you run with it with the fullness of my blessing. And so when we get to the end of this letter, I'm just going to tell you in advance, I feel very strongly that if you're compelled by what you see in the Bible, by what you see in the New Testament, that maybe you just kind of owe it to Paul to read this whole thing from beginning to end. And maybe with your antenna out for what part of this blessing is maybe transferable to you, what part of this might have been written with future audiences, with you in mind to receive what's in it as well. I like this one, and I got a soft spot for it. The structure of it is really simple. Point number one is he's reflecting on his life, and he's saying this is the way I want to deliver it. I wouldn't do it any other way. Big time paraphrase his mind there, but it's faithful to what he's communicating. And he's thankful to God for helping him to see it through. He's thankful to God for his faithfulness, and he's exhorting Timothy not to be ashamed of Jesus and also not to be ashamed of his spiritual father, Paul. Apparently a lot of people had been like, well, Paul, if you're right, how come God keeps letting you get in prison? I'm not going to hang around with that and take the social punishment that comes from associating with you. This is a human phenomenon we still see today when people get in trouble on the Internet, and everybody goes underground real quick and gets real, real quiet because they don't want the bad vibes of however one individual ran afoul of everyone on the Internet to rub off on them. The same thing was happening back then. Paul was lonely. He says at the end of his letter that only Luke has remained with them, and he wants Timothy to get ahead of the weather because it's wintertime and get there to see him. But in all of that, in the opening of this letter, Paul is saying Christ is faithful. Timothy remained faithful to Christ. Make that the centerpiece of your life moving forward. In the second part of the book, Paul deals with a few practical things still dealing with ongoing problems and Ephesus. First Timothy was maybe written three, four, maybe as many as five years earlier. And despite Timothy's efforts, it looks like there were still problems, particularly there were still problems with people denying the existence of resurrection, denying the existence of this future hope of life in Christ, or maybe just suggesting that the resurrection already happened, and it's already over with. Either way, the result is the same. It's making for a weird, ineffective faith and a bad read on the Scriptures or even a disregard for the Scriptures. As Paul is like, hey, Timothy, you've got to point people back to that stuff. All Scripture is God breathed. It's wildly useful for a whole stack of things. And all of that stuff that Scripture does is meant to make the man of God, the woman of God, thoroughly equipped for every good work, and Ephesus could use a dose of that. And then in the final chapter, Paul says, look, people are not going to like the things that you have to say. You being a faithful representative of Jesus is going to be provocative and an irritant. It's okay. Be steadfast. Stay in it. Nothing matters more. And then he gets into those really personal greetings that I've talked about a bit throughout our conversation here, including things as specific as like, hey, Timothy, it's very cold in this prison and we're headed into Roman winter. Would you bring my coat? And also I have a stack of scrolls that I left in Troas. Would you grab those as well? And again, please hurry. The weather's changing. I don't want you to get delayed by weather because I might not ever get to see you again. If Paul has a feeling this is it. And indeed, this was it. He was executed in Rome shortly after writing this letter. When you visualize the book of 2 Timothy, picture a cold prison. When you think about the theme, reflect on the dangerous, meaningful life in service of Christ that Paul had lived and the invitation that he gives to Timothy, and I think by proxy us to follow suit. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, please make time to read the whole thing. I think Paul has earned the dignity of being thoroughly heard out in these final thoughts, and I think you'll find it to be very meaningful as well. All right, there we go. That's 2 Timothy Achievement Unlocked. Next time around, we're on to the Book of Titus. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Titus. When you turn the page from 2 Timothy over to Titus, if you're reading straight through the New Testament, it can be a little bit disorienting because it feels like in 2 Timothy, that is the end of Paul, like he's going to die shortly after that letter was written. And indeed, he did die shortly after that letter was written. And so you turn it over to Titus and it's like, what? How is Paul still writing letters? Well, this is an important moment for us to remind ourselves that the arrangement of the letters in the New Testament are not chronological. Now that said, still Titus, this letter we're looking at today, is one of the latest letters that Paul wrote before his death. The Book of Acts takes us up to Paul being in prison and preaching freely in prison in Rome, but then the book cuts off pretty abruptly right there. In order to cobble together what happened in the rest of Paul's life, we have to go and look at the little personal details we get in a bunch of these letters that make up the rest of the New Testament. And when we do that, it becomes pretty evident that Paul did not die in that first very blase fair imprisonment that he experienced in Rome. Probably his accusers didn't even show up for the trial and they were like, well, I mean, you're free to go then. I guess that's that. It looks like after that, Paul went right back to Ephesus. It makes sense. He loved this church and he leaves his protege, Timothy, there. Then Paul goes up to mainland Greece probably and very quickly gets word from Timothy. They're like, whoa, we got problems. Like as soon as you left, it became very evident people might have been on their best behavior while you were here, but they are not on their best behavior now. What should I do? And then Paul writes first, Timothy, back to him, empowering him, encouraging him, commissioning him and being like, go get him, pal. You can straighten out that Ephesian church, I believe in you. From there, it looks like Paul journeys down to Crete, more on Crete in just a second and leaves his buddy Titus, for whom this book that we're about to look at is named, on Crete. In the same way he left Timothy in Ephesus, Titus's job is going to be to straighten things out and make things go with the little churches that are popping up in Crete. From there, it looks like Paul goes back to mainland Greece where he gets word from Titus. Like, hey, I'm running into some problems here. The reputation of the Cretans as being not necessarily the most honest. It is a problem for the church. Please advise. And it looks like from mainland Greece, Paul writes back to Titus, the letter that we're getting right here and gives him some instructions on what to do. Obviously, we're going to look more at that here in just a second. And then finally, Paul makes his way to Troas where he gets a surprise visit from the authorities and is arrested quickly without even time to gather his things. He doesn't get to take his coat with him. He doesn't get to grab all of his scrolls and he's taken back to Rome and probably put in a much harsher second imprisonment. And this is the imprisonment from which he writes 2 Timothy. And this also then would be the imprisonment that leads to Paul's execution, his beheading at the hands of the Roman officials. So Titus then comes really close to the end of Paul's life, of Paul's ministry. And at this point, as we'll see when we look closer at the details of the book, these churches, they all have the same kind of problems. There's just four or five that seem to crop up at every church all around the world, wherever Paul is. And by now, he's a cagey veteran. He knows how to tackle these things and how to equip other people to deal with these things. Cret is a very significant historical location in the Mediterranean world. Let's just picture the Mediterranean Sea, right? This big, this long kind of looks like a wide biscuit. And up in the north, you got the Italian boot sticking down, Greek peninsula sticking down. That's Europe. And then on the south side of the Mediterranean Sea, you got North Africa. And then out on the west side of the sea, you get that little tiny baby pinch point that is the straits of Gibraltar between Portugal, Spain, up there on the north, and then like Morocco down there on the south. And then clear out east. Of course, you've got Jerusalem and Judea and Asia and all of that business. Okay. If you just think about the boot that is Italy in the middle of all of that, and then you just go slightly east from that. There's a great big, long, flat, horizontal island. That one, if you can picture it, is Crete. And it's a really big deal because there's this whole civilization called Minoan civilization that is one of the early, great dominant expressions of Greek civilization from what we call the Greek civilization. Way, way, way, way, way back in history. We were talking centuries and centuries before Jesus and before Persia way back there. They had a dominant military. They had robust mythology, the story of the labyrinth and the monster that guarded the labyrinth, the minotaurs, you know, the Minoan civilization, Mino tar. That comes from the island of Crete. And apparently back in the day, in a bid to assert Crete and dominance over all the other Greeks, they claimed that Zeus was born there and had a special place in his heart for Crete, a special affection for it. That Zeus was the patron god, not of mainland Greece, but of the Minoans. Now, as we know from what we learned about Corinth and Ephesus, there was big money back then if you could lay claim to a very important patron Greek god. And it created apparently this gigantic stir and hubbub about you, Creteans being big time liars. You know, dang, well, Zeus wasn't born on your island. That's ridiculous. And so dating all the way back to the 6th or even 7th century BC, you've got references from writings that came out of Crete about this reputation of the Creteans being liars, including one dude who was a seer, philosopher, prophet, poet, orator, his name was Epimenities. He was self-critical of the Creteans for lying about Zeus. And Paul is actually going to draw on this ancient Greek thinkers' words to agree with him and double down and say, you know, what, lying is a problem there, but we're going to confront it with the truth of Christ. And that's the plan of attack that he hands off to Titus in this short little letter that he gives him. So what we discover in chapter one is that we're running into the exact same problem we have everywhere. There are Jewish sort of Christians who are here. They resent the Gentile Christians and they try to inflict the Old Testament law on these Gentile Christians, most notably in the form of circumcision, the sign of the covenant with Abraham, given all the way back in Genesis. But these guys double down on it and they're like, well, not only are we going to help you out by telling you you need to be circumcised and we actually have the toolkit right here just to make that happen whenever you're ready. But also, since this is such important information, we're obviously also going to have to charge you a certain clerical fee for delivering that important message to you. And Paul's letter to Titus just opens with him being like, no, we're not doing any of that. It's lying. It's stupid. Don't play along with it in any way. Point them to the truth of Christ. Ignore the lie. And then he, as I promised, cites Epimemetities here in verse 12 of Titus 1 and it is harsh. Paul says, even one of their own prophets has said, Creteans are always liars, evil, brutes and lazy gluttons. This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth. I would like to distance myself from this claim a little bit right now. I've never been to Crete flown over it a couple of times. It looked really pretty in the pictures I've seen there seem great. History is really interesting. But I understand what Paul is taking a swipe at here and I understand how sick and tired of this same manipulation and the same falsehood he was at this point in the game. And I love the way he seems to be throwing down the gauntlet and saying, let's get rid of things that we know are lies. We know that happens there. And let's instead counter that with things that we know to be truth. And then Paul goes on to confront the second big problem here, which is that the Christian lifestyle isn't honoring to God as it's being carried out in Crete. And the way people conduct themselves in public life and in their households, it looks just like how the Creteans do things. And we just heard what both Epimemetities and Paul think about how the Creteans do things. So Paul's like, you got to do stuff different. One, because it's honoring to God and obedient to your God. But second, because this is a testimony, it's a witness to the people around you. You guys got to change. And so for what are we on now? The third, fourth time in his letters, Paul goes into the household. He's like, hey, you got to run your households differently. You can't do the flandering and you can't do the sloppiness with the relationships. You should look to build strong, healthy families that influence the community well, that serve the community well, and that point to the people who are living in the community, that serve the community well. And that point to the glory and the truth of Christ. The big overarching point though that Paul seems to be making in regards to all of this is that society is a mess and the grace of God is going to make society better. Now I'm seeing that in the world right now today. We live in a moment in time where everyone is constantly made to feel guilty about things they've done, that maybe they should feel guilty about things they've done, that maybe they shouldn't actually feel guilty about. And things they didn't even do or have anything to do with at all. Guilt is a weapon to advance policy and social preferences at this moment in life. And it's a disappointing habit that we've developed as a society. I look forward to us getting that more in balance. But everybody as a result of that guilt society we live in is desperate for atonement, some mechanism for forgiveness. But no, no, no. We are not going to give it to each other. We are in a societal moment where we're going to hold that guilt over people as long as we can as a point of leverage. But the gift of Christ and of the church and of individual Christians to a society is grace. There is atonement. There is forgiveness. There is some mechanism to restore things that are tense, that are broken, that are calamitous. And that is the release valve that Paul seems to believe, and I happen to agree with him, that Cretan society is not a place to be. That Cretan society was begging for. It was the problem they dealt with. And the Christians had a lock-and-key solution that was a perfect fit for what was wrong with Cretan. And I would argue that part of the beauty of the book of Titus is that Paul spends chapter 2 and into chapter 3, making a case that totally applies to the world we've built now as well in terms of the power and effectiveness of grace in society delivered from Christ by Christians. And the effect that that has, not just on people who believe in God or in the church, but on everybody. And I love the vision for things that Paul is painting a picture of here in this letter he's writing to Titus. When you visualize the book of Titus, picture the island of Crete when you think about the theme of the book, reflect on the grace of Christ, a societal grace even made evident by the lives of Christians and the church. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least catch chapter 2, verse 11, through chapter 3, verse 8. And with that, I would like to congratulate the both of us on unlocking the Titus achievement onto the teeny tiny little baby book of Philemon next time around.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Philemon. The Book of Philemon is a letter written by the apostle Paul to a Christian leader in the Church of Colossae named Philemon. And if you recall back to when we did our conversation about the Book of Colossians, the Paul didn't really know anybody in that church or almost nobody in that church. He didn't found the church, he hadn't been there yet, and he wrote that letter to the Colossians from one of his many prisons days and was hoping to get to go and visit them sometime later when he got out. He was aware of some of the problems and the challenges in that church and he was particularly interested in having them reimagine how they do their households there in light of the truth of the new family of faith and the equalizing effect that the work of Christ has in making this new family of faith where everybody, regardless of your gender, your race, or your ethnicity, or even your social status, even slave or free according to Paul in Colossians 3 verse 11, reimagine all of that because you're all equal in Christ as members of this new family, as sons, daughters, children, heirs, agents of the king because of the glorious work of Christ. It's pretty awesome and it's wildly forward thinking. It's also the kind of thing that just begs for a test case to figure out if anybody actually means it. Because if you take that to its logical conclusions, it would require Christians to act in some ways that are very weird and very countercultural. And that is exactly what we get in the scenario surrounding this book of Philemon and the content of the letter there in. Philemon, the recipient of this letter, is a wealthy leader in the church at Colossae and Paul seems to hold him in high regard. My guess would be that Philemon became a Christian because of that Ephesus effect we've talked about before. Remember Paul said that what happened in Ephesus among the Christians had a ripple effect. It affected the whole greater Ephesus region and it looks like Colossae is a byproduct of that being founded by Apaphris, who we talked about before, and Philemon. Well, everybody in the Roman world had servants and slaves in their household. Now this is not the ethnic slavery of the British colonial world and the American south. This is a social slavery and it's a different flavor, but it is still not good and it's not the status one would want to find themselves in at the same time. It was very baked into how society and the economy worked all throughout the Roman world. So it would not be weird on its surface. Pretty much nobody would look at anyone Christian or otherwise having slaves in their household and be like, what are you doing? That is a moral abomination. But weirdly, Paul taking the conclusions of the message of Christ out to their logical ends does raise an eyebrow at it. And it looks like the scenario that unfolded in Colossae is that Philemon had a slave named Onesimus and somehow Onesimus wrongs him and then runs away. That's a pretty big deal and that's very punishable by Roman law. I don't know how Onesimus ends up visiting Paul in prison, but he does. And through the influence of Paul, he becomes a Christian. Well, now we got ourselves a bona fide conundrum because Philemon is a Christian and Onesimus is a Christian and Paul's been going around saying that, hey, if you really think about what Jesus is saying here, like we're all sons and daughters of the king and that transcends and trumps the social order of things. Well, is Paul going to stick with that or is Paul going to back down because now it's very inconvenient and he might lose a church by irritating one of the prominent leaders of this church. If Paul were to mishandle the situation and maybe advocate for Onesimus and not give Philemon, the justice that he is owed for the bad behavior of his slave under Roman law, what is Paul to do? And what's going to happen right now between you and I is a little bit different than anything we've done before. I've actually invited a guest who is an expert on the subject to tell you about what Paul decided to do with the situation and that is the Apostle Paul because it's a really short letter and I can just read you the whole thing and I'm straight up going to do that, but pay extra close attention. I know sometimes with lots of Bible words in a row, it can be easy to let that start to wash over you. But think about the setup that we just went through here. Think back to what we know about the Colossian church. Think about what Paul has been saying about the rules for households and the way he's been undermining slavery as an institution in favor of this better human relationship born out of Christ and see if you can catch all of the subtle things that he is doing here. It goes like this, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy, our brother to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker to Afia, our sister to archapace, our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers because I hear about your faith and the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you'll have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ. Your love has given me great joy and encouragement because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints. Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you want to do, yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus, I appeal to you for my son, Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he's become useful both to you and to me. I'm sending him, who is my very heart, back to you. I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I'm in chains for the gospel, but I didn't want to do anything without your consent so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced. Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good. No longer is a slave, but better than a slave as a dear brother. He's very dear to me, but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord. So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he's done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back, not to mention that you owe me your very self. I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you and the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience. I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. And one more thing, prepare a guest room for me because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. A path for us, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus sends you greetings. And so to Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with your spirit. Seems like a real friendly little letter, right? Like, it's good to talk to your prayer room and everything. I'm sending him back. You know, you know what I'll probably work out, but it's not. It's a huge ask because Paul is not only asking Philemon to forgo the justice he has owed, but further he's asking Philemon to free this slave and treat him as a brother. Everybody in town would know what he did. Everybody would know that he didn't exact this justice. It might look like he's gone soft. Plus, apparently, Onesimus was really talented and good at things. And that would be a loss for Philemon's household. What a gigantic request on the part of Paul. But clearly, Paul thinks Philemon is good for it and that he's going to do it. It's a reversal that's reminiscent of the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, right? Where the kid takes all his dad's money and goes, he blows it on stupid stuff. And then he's like, ah, I'm broken. I'm eating pig slop. I'm going to go back to my dad. And I'm going to be like, Dad, I'm sorry. I sinned against you in this heaven. Just take me back as one of your servants. Remember, he has that whole speech rehearse, but the dad sees him from a long ways off. And he goes running out to the offender, his son. And he doesn't even let him get through the whole speech and he embraces him. And not only forgives the wrong that he did, but restores him to that role of cherished family member of son. Once again, that's the request that Paul is putting in front of Philemon. And if Philemon does it, it's going to change him forever. It's going to change Onesimus forever. It's going to change that church forever. It's going to change Colossae forever. But look at the little note there toward the end to where Paul doesn't write off the offense. There's still a debt that is owed, but Paul in imitating Jesus is like, charge it to me. I'll take that punishment. I had nothing to do with what went wrong. But if a debt is owed, I will pay the debt so that this thing can be made right. This new family can be formed. This is a beautiful real world manifestation of what this new paradigm that we were begging for coming out of the Old Testament looks like in action. Now, my friends, this is no throwaway letter. This is a huge moment in the history of the church, a huge moment in the unfolding of the New Testament. And further, this sets a trajectory for all of the justice that has been done and that has happened in the name of Christ throughout the centuries. And that continues to happen today in the name of Christ. This is a natural, necessary extension of all of the stuff we've been seeing about who Jesus is and his words and his works and the cross and the resurrection. And all of the stuff that Paul has taught and lived out since, along with the other apostles, it points toward this kind of selflessness, this sort of forgiveness and restoration. And I think this is absolutely beautiful. And I hope you go and read this letter for yourself. When you visualize the book of Philemon, picture a runaway slave. When you think about the theme, reflect on the way the new paradigm, the new covenant in Christ rewrites everything about our relationships. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, don't worry about it. I just read it to you. You got that one in your hip pocket now. Philemon, level up. Next time around, one of the most theologically dense books in the whole New Testament. It's the very rich book of Hebrews. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Hebrews. A lot of people who are really into the Bible will tell you that Hebrews might be the hardest book in the whole document. But I would argue that based on what you just got done doing, going through the whole Old Testament and the whole New Testament up to this point with me, that it might not be the hardest book in the Bible for you, because you are built for this. You're viewing, you've undertaken looking at the scriptures from a 10,000 foot view and trying to see it and hold it in your mental cache all at once. So as you go through the book of Hebrews, there's going to be tons of Old Testament. The most Old Testament that we have seen since the book of Matthew. And I'm guessing based on the exercise that we've been through together so far that you're going to recognize a ton of it. So I guess what I'm trying to say on the front end here is that Hebrews and your experience in reading it and reading it carefully is kind of one of the big payoffs for the energy and thought and time that you have invested together with me in trying to take in the Bible and consider it in the way we have been considering it together. If however, you pick it up and you try to read through it and it's kind of hard, don't feel discouraged because it is covering a lot of theology. We don't know who wrote the book of Hebrews. There some friends I have who are absolutely brilliant, scholarly. They know all of this stuff better than I'll ever know it. And they would say, ah, it is definitely Paul. I got other friends who are absolutely brilliant, wonderful people, super well studied and they'd say there's no way this could have been Paul and they've all got their reasons. I don't know who wrote it. Paul signed all of his other letters, but this one isn't signed. So that makes me think maybe it wasn't Paul. But what I do know is this, whoever wrote this document knows the disciples of Jesus is very familiar with what is unfolding in particularly the Jewish Christian church and whoever is writing this document hangs out with Jewish people a ton because they are assuming a mountain of Old Testament knowledge on the part of their audience. And they obviously know the Old Testament and well, what we call the Old Testament inside and out as well. This is a hyper Jesus centric book. You know how the entire time we've been going through the Old Testament, there's all this stuff that's been jumping off the page where together we're like, well, look at that points to Jesus. This anticipates how the redemptive plan is going to work out in this promised king who is to come and this one who would be the fulfillment of the sacrificial system. Like it's all got to happen the whole Old Testament begs for this new paradigm. It begs for this Messiah, this king, this new family of faith. Well, the book of Hebrews, the author of Hebrews, they really, really agree with that assessment. They view Jesus as the completion. Just like he said about himself in Matthew 5 17, they view Jesus as the completion of everything that has come before. But that Jesus centricness of the book of Hebrews doesn't just happen in a vacuum. It's not like Jesus is supreme and he's the best, just generically he is. No, Jesus throughout the book of Hebrews is lined up against other really significant characters in the whole story of faith. And the author of Hebrews is making it real clear. Jesus is not another link in the chain. Jesus is not another prophet, another law giver, another leader, another high priest, another heavenly messenger from God. No, no, no, no, no. All of those things point to Jesus. He's not part of a cosmology of important characters in this story. He's the point of the story. The big thesis of Hebrews is that Jesus is supreme over all things, the completion of everything. But the undertone to Hebrews, the point of application to it is you don't want to miss out on that. Whatever you're going through in life, no matter how difficult things are because you're following Jesus, he is worth it because of that supremacy. Stay steadfast in following him. Well, the letter opens with a bang clearly arguing in the opening lines that Jesus is what I am. He is God in the flesh that he's greater than all previous messengers from God who God is used in the past. He's not just some prophet. He's not just some angel. He is indeed God in the flesh. But here's what's crazy about it. The author of Hebrews argues is that he has all that power and yet he humbled himself and allowed himself to die to accomplish all the redemptive things that he set out to accomplish. Of course, echoes what Paul is saying in that hymn about Jesus in Philippians chapter two that we looked at a while back. So contrast number one in the book of Hebrews is that Jesus is greater than any other message, giver, prophet or angel that he is God in the flesh. Comparison number two is between Jesus and Moses. Jesus isn't just another law giver bringing a new one to try it again because maybe the old ones just weren't quite fully developed and God needs to give it one more run. No, no, no, no, no. Jesus is the completion of the law, the fulfillment of the law. And there's a warning here in the second comparison. It's the other of Hebrews is like, Hey, look what happens when our ancestors didn't follow Moses out in the desert. They didn't even get to go to the promised land. Hey, you would not want to miss out on what comes with following this new and better Moses that being Jesus. So hey, no matter how difficult it is, once again, it's worth it. He's supreme. Follow Jesus. There we roll into a third contrast between Jesus as high priest and the ultimate mediator between God and man and Melchizedek, this historical Old Testament figure who was a mediator and a great high priest between God and man here. Once again, you're getting the formula by now. The point is Jesus is supreme in this role over any human who held that position beforehand. He's the ultimate mediator and maker of right relationship between people and God. We are only made right with God through the mediating work of Christ. Don't underestimate Jesus or lump him in with other characters in this story and in doing so miss out depend on him as the initiator and mediator of union relationship with God. Then we get a fourth contrast between not a person and Jesus, but the sacrificial system and Jesus and the point here once again is Jesus is greater than that. He is the perfect sacrifice for all for everything. It covers even the stuff you forgot. This is what the sacrificial system was always begging for, always pointing to. And the author of Hebrews seems to be saying it is a great deal. Don't overthink it. Take it. And then the whole book of Hebrews pivots into what is probably the most famous part that being chapter 11, where you get this echo of Matthew chapter one, the genealogy that Matthew opens with where Matthew is saying, like, look, every single character in this story at all points to Jesus. So it is in chapter 11 where we get a look at these rock stars of faith. But again, the point is what they all had in common despite their flaws was faith. They believed God. They trusted God. They followed God and Christ is I am in the flesh. He is God. Therefore the author of Hebrews is saying all of these characters point to Jesus and all of them testify to Jesus even right now. So don't miss out on this thing. Follow Christ. Hebrews has got a really interesting rhythm because it's heavyweight, historically rooted old testament rooted, prophetically rooted theology, but it's also very practical. It keeps coming out of the esoteric and back down to what will you do with this and what you should do is persist and endure because this is the inheritance. This is what we as Jewish believers have been waiting for. So hold fast to it. When you visualize the book of Hebrews, picture that old testament hall of fame, maybe with like the gold bust sculptures of all of the different characters lined up in there. When you think about the theme, reflect on how the author of Hebrews is saying it all, all of it, everything points to Jesus who is ultimate and supreme and God in the flesh. Don't miss out. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get those opening lines in chapter one versus one through five and then read from 11 one through 12 two. Finally, no joking around here. Congratulations on the work that you've put in to level up your understanding of the Bible in a comprehensive way to put yourself in a position where you can pick up the book of Hebrews and track with exactly what's going on. That really is quite the accomplishment and I respect it way to be. We're doing the work together to position ourselves to encounter the Bible the way it's meant to be encountered. It ain't easy, but I think it's worth it. I think that merits our little level up sound. Next time around, we get the book of James. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about James. The book of James is a letter written by James almost surely. This is the James who is the half-brother of Jesus, and this letter is written to Jewish Christians scattered all over the place in general. Unlike the letters we got from Paul, this letter is not addressed specifically to a church that is going through a certain set of circumstances, and it's not addressed to some kind of partner in ministry on a personal level. This is a general letter, and indeed that's the nickname that has been used for all of the remaining letters of the New Testament. These are general letters or general epistles that are just directed at a wide, wide audience of Christians dealing with big topics that lots of people would have been asking about. The book of James in particular is directed toward Jewish Christians who are scattered all about, and we know that because at the beginning it says, James, a servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes scattered among the nations in this opening chapter, we figure out pretty quickly that he's writing a very practical book that is meant to give direction to Jewish Christians like James who were struggling with the transition from thinking in second temple period, old Jewish failed paradigm categories to thinking in terms of the New Covenant, the kingdom categories, this new paradigm of what it is to be a Jewish Christian, a Jewish follower of Christ. Now James would be an expert in the difficulties of that transition and an expert in anticipating the questions people would have because he wasn't initially convinced that Jesus was the Messiah. There's a bunch of stuff throughout the New Testament that indicates that Jesus' whole family dragged their feet a little bit. Looks like at least on one occasion they felt like maybe he was getting in over his head and they needed to come and rescue him and they wouldn't even come in to a talk that he was giving instead they stood outside and sent messages in to be like, we need to talk to you, we need to retrieve you. And that's where Jesus gives us that really famous statement at the end of Matthew 12 where he's like, who is my mother, brother, family? I tell you, it's the people who do the will of my father in heaven. Wow, what a bold statement Jesus makes there, both stiff-arming his own family, including his brother James's attempt to reign him in, but also pointing out that this new family of faith is a real thing. It was quite the seizing of the opportunity that the circumstances presented there on the part of Jesus in Matthew 12. Well, somewhere later on James does come around and he emerges as the leader of the Jerusalem Church as the other disciples go out to the ends of the earth and spread the gospel in the various ways they do and all meet their grisly, violent fates that they run into. Everybody except John dies prematurely and in a murderous fashion for what they're teaching about Jesus. And James is no exception. He emerges as the leader of the Jerusalem Church. He's the guy in Acts chapter 15 when their disputes getting stirred up between the Judaizer types who want the Gentile Christians all throughout the world to act just like them. And the Gentile Christians were like, I don't know about that. Well, it's James who makes peace and stands in the middle is like, no, we can't put that on them. Instead, here is three basic expectations that we can all agree upon for what it looks like to be a Christian as it pertains to these questions. James is also a guy who was profoundly pastoral. He clearly wanted to help people make sense of their faith in Christ and make sense of what their lives looked like, especially in difficult times and difficult times is pretty much all James knew as the leader of the church in Jerusalem. You'll recall that Paul in his letters is always talking about having to take up this offering. The offering is for the people in Jerusalem because the Christians there were on very difficult times. There was a famine and the other churches around the Mediterranean world were able to prop them up during that time. But also there was all kinds of persecution during that time. We look back at history and we think about all the Roman persecution that happened in the first few centuries of Christianity. And indeed, there's a lot of that kind of stuff we've talked about in our conversations. But the first persecutors of the church weren't the Romans. They were the Jews who didn't believe Jesus was the Messiah and felt that Jesus was a threat to their standing and their position and their power. And so James and the early Jerusalem Jewish Christians, they were up against that kind of stuff all the time. And finally that boiled over during an exchange, a handoff of power between Roman governors. Nobody was paying attention very briefly in the early 60s AD. And we've got accounts that James dies in an imaginative, multifaceted, violent way that involved being shoved off of some high area on the temple and then being hit with rocks and then finally done in with a Fuller's cudgel. You know, like somebody who cleans fancy rugs and stuff by beating it with that heavy stick. That's the thing that the history tells us finally did in James. He died very ugly, but James's reputation, his nickname was James the just or James the old camel need because they said that he used to go and pray on his knees until he wore them out and tore them up, pleading with God for the forgiveness of his fellow countrymen, his fellow Jewish brothers and sisters for what they had done in rejecting Christ and in seeking Christ executed. It's no surprise then that he's going to lean into the stuff that ends up being recorded in the gospel of Matthew, which is the most Jewish of the four gospels. And there's a ton of stuff in James's very practical book of New Testament wisdom here that looks like it's drawn directly from the teachings of Christ as recorded in the book of Matthew. Well, Jesus said in more than one way, if you love me, you'll keep my commands. And James right out of the gate says effectively the same thing. It's not enough to just hear what God says. You got to do what God says. And James seems to be again making peace and speaking with brevity and clarity to say, I'm going to speak to roughly a dozen of the key issues that seem to be plaguing Jewish Christians in the early going and give you wisdom on what it looks like to put your faith into action and to obey and identify with Jesus with your deeds. So he talks about things like how to use money and the way money can create pride and the way money can cause you to focus on living in the now, but he encourages that expectant living that we also see Paul encouraging the people he's writing to. He insists on integrity and truth telling. He challenges his readers to familiarize themselves and remind themselves of their own mortality and the fleetingness of life so that they'll be oriented the right way toward what's going on around them and oriented the right way toward God. He talks about avoiding favoritism in church because some people are fancier or richer or people of greater influences. That's not in keeping with the values of the kingdom or how this family of faith works. He also talks at length about claiming to believe in Jesus without kingdom value actions that undergird all of that or that grow out of all of that. And he says very explicitly that faith without works is dead. Your faith isn't real. If it isn't producing some kind of fruit, if it isn't producing anything. And also James talks a ton about the tongue and how what we say using our tongues, using our mouths reveals things about what's really going on at the deepest level of our hearts. It reveals whether we are actually in Christ. And so stuff like gossip and dishonesty and double speak and cruel speech, all of that stuff makes no sense for the Christian. And in so many words, you seem to be saying like if you find yourself doing all of that, you should carefully examine what's going on because it has no place in the life of the Christian. Indeed, I think that might be one of the most convicting passages in the entire Bible for any one of us who takes an honest look at what the Bible has to say from beginning to end. They are tough, stern, honest, fair, needed words about the tongue and about how easy it is for that to get out of control. It's really clear that James is aware that Christians are suffering, that this is difficult, that suffering is external internal. It's coming from all over the place. But he's encouraging Christians by saying God is going to use that suffering to build in you something you can't build in yourself. And that is singleness of heart. All of the behavioral stuff that James addresses at some level can be boiled down to duplicitous in a saying you believe one thing, but doing another again, faith without works is dead. And he is urging his readers toward singleness of heart, believe the right things about Jesus, and then do the right things in keeping with that and don't have another version of yourself. So James then is saying that while suffering is unpleasant and unfun, it is something that God uses to drive people and refine Christians. Big picture. The book of James is a very practical book full of wisdom that can be very confrontive and jarring to read because of how close to home it hits again and again and again. And the big point that James seems to be driving at is that God uses suffering to refine the hearts of Christians away from duplicitousness and falseness and toward having a singleness of heart directed toward Christ. When you visualize the book of James, as gross as this sounds, picture the tongue. When you think about the theme, reflect on how James is designed to offer wisdom for gaining singleness of heart for God. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least check out chapter one achievement unlocked. There's the book of James next time around somebody we haven't heard from for a long time. Peter is back. We get the letter of first Peter up next. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 1 Peter. You remember Peter? We have not seen him forever. He gets mentioned a couple of times in Paul's letters, I think. But other than that, it's really the middle of the book of Acts that is the last time we see him doing stuff. And we leave off with Peter in kind of an interesting place. You'll recall he was the disciple who was loud and brash and bold around Jesus. He was always saying what everybody was thinking, but the only one willing to take the risk. And as a result, he got to participate in amazing things. He also got to look super stupid at times. And the book of Matthew ends with him saying, I'm never going to leave you. Never. How totally be faithful to you. Totally forever. You can completely count on me. I'll never let you down. And then within like half a page, he denies Jesus three times and runs away in Jesus' greatest moment of need. Crying into the night. We don't hear from him again in the entire book of Matthew. The very last bit of stuff that we get in the Gospels at the very, very, very end of the book of John includes details about the resurrected Jesus restoring Peter. And in the same way that Peter denied Christ three times, three times Jesus tells Peter to take care of his sheep to take care of the people who are going to follow Jesus. And to Peter's credit, it looks like he does that. It looks like he goes through a massive maturation process. And early in the book of Acts, we see him being like, whoa, God's doing something here. The Holy Spirit has arrived. I should say something. What would Jesus do? What would Jesus do? Oh, I know. Because one of the last things he remembered Jesus doing was looking back through all of the Old Testament and pointing out how all of it pointed toward him. So Peter's the guy who gets up at the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter two. And it's like, all right, here is some stuff from the Old Testament. And look, all of this is from God. And it was always pointing to Jesus. And it's like we can almost see him getting his footing there in the first half of the book of Acts. And in those first several chapters, we see Peter finally followed through on what he said he was going to do when he was making big bold promises to Jesus back on the night he got arrested. He actually does take the beatings and the abuse on behalf of Jesus. And we know that eventually he dies as a martyr tradition says that he got crucified upside down at the site of Nero's horse racing track across the Tiber River on the outskirts of Rome in a place that is now the Vatican where St. Peter's Basilica sits. So this guy casts a very long shadow over the early church and the rest of Christian history. He's a gigantic deal. But part of the reason that he's so beloved is because he's so human. The guy is trying and he's taken big swings and it doesn't always work out exactly right. And he even goes on to make more stupid mistakes after the book of Acts and given into peer pressure and showing a little bit of favoritism like getting wrong exactly what James in the previous book said Christians need to get right. So like us, the guy wasn't perfect, but perhaps all the more so because of that, he was well positioned to encourage Christians of all different stripes and all around the Roman world right up until the time that he was martyred probably in the late 60s AD. Well, the occasion of this letter is that Peter's got word about the difficulties that are going on for Gentile Christians in particular in Asia Minor, which is a very pro-Roman part of the world at this time. And Peter can very much empathize with what it's like to be a Christian in that context because he's writing from a pretty pro-Roman place himself, that being Rome. Well, he takes a really interesting tack in encouraging these Gentile believers toward godliness and faithfulness and remaining in Christ. He uses a whole bunch of images and stories and theological language from the Old Testament and uses it inclusively to be like, no, this is all your story. I know ethnically you guys are Gentiles or whatever, but in Christ, this is your story too. The ups and the downs, the good and the bad, the ugly of it all. Certainly that was something Peter could relate to neatly as well. And in using a bunch of these images, he's saying that you guys are the real deal. You're completely in and like God's chosen people of the past, you as members of this new family of faith, you're set apart from the rest of the world as well. So if you feel like outsiders, Peter seems to be reasoning. That would just make sense. If you suffer, Peter seems to be reasoning. That would make sense. You're outsiders. You're not going to fit. You're a part of this much larger historical story of God working with the group of people toward his redemptive ends. And you all have roles in this kingdom. You matter. You count. But then he goes on to say that in order for you all to play these roles, you got to stand strong in the face of this spiritual opposition. It feels like physical opposition, but Peter develops the theme, especially in the closing lines of this letter that much like what Paul said at the end of the book of Ephesians. You're not really fighting against flesh and blood. I know it feels like it when somebody made a flesh and blood is whooping on you and your flesh and blood is in pain. But the truer reality is that you're fighting against spiritual darkness that is much bigger than any of the political things or physical things that are going on. So in order then to be able to do what you're supposed to do and to play the role that you need to play and to be a part of this holy people set apart for God, you got to keep striving toward maturity. You have to like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk so that by it you can grow up in your salvation. And then he moves on to there to hit it even harder in the same tone and the same line of thought that James was taking in his letter. He hits the theme even harder that the suffering you guys are going through. It has a purpose. God is going to use that to accomplish things, to prepare you, to communicate truths about himself, to the people around you who right now seem really hostile to you, but they are watching. So be faithful in difficult situations. And Peter says, if you take a beating, like I get it. It's not just. It's not right. And there will be justice for that eventually. But in the meantime, if you take a beating, if you take abuse, make sure it is because you are a part of the world. Because you are a part of this holy set apart people who like newborn babies of craved spiritual milk and you've grown up in your salvation and you've set aside all of the ugly stuff like malice and deceit and hypocrisy and envy and slander of every kind. All the stupid stuff. If you take abuse, make sure it's because you are living for Christ and don't take abuse because your agitators or busy bodies or loud mouths or disruptive or stupid. And in keeping with that theme, that really shrewd strategy that Peter is advancing, he says that even in your households, there may be injustice. In fact, he knows there is injustice and you may have to endure that injustice for a time. But even if you are a bond servant or a slave or even a child in a difficult household run by people who are hostile toward you, really the truth is you are well positioned to model the humility of Christ and the truth of the God. And the truth of the gospel to the people around you, even in those difficult circumstances, which again, there will be justice for. And as we get to the end of the letter, we're getting the clear sense that there is uniformity among the big names in the New Testament in Christian thought as to what the strategy is going to be for existing as the new family of faith, existing as a spiritual kingdom within this worldly kingdom that is Rome and that is very hostile toward you. And the strategy is not to take up the sword, but it's to put down the sword. And if need be, endure indignity and abuses, surely no one will endure more injustice than Christ, who was righteous, pure in every way, and yet still was subjected to death, even humbled himself to death on a cross. So the strategy isn't let's blow up Rome, let's detonate all of its social structures, let's take over the government, let's win on the military front, let's win a culture war. And look, I know there are people who make the case that maybe the strategy needs to be different to different points in history. That's a conversation for another day, but what we can clearly say here is that Jesus, Paul, Peter, even going all the way back to Jeremiah and the prophetic council that he gave the exiles as they were about to be taken away to Babylon, they're all coming from the same direction. Be people of peace, be people who build up your community, be people who show care for those who are in need, live upright lives. If you get persecuted, let it be because you were living upright lives for Christ and don't let it be because you were into mischief and slander and gossip and being duplicitous. That seems to be the plan that is prescribed really from Jeremiah on in the Bible for what to do while you are in either literal or metaphorical exile. And I think Jeremiah, Jesus, Paul and Peter are all very vindicated in that because Christianity on paper had no business working out. It shouldn't have happened. The cultural forces that were in place were so massive and so overwhelming. There was no room for some new upstart ideology to come out of nowhere and unify the world under its banner. Yet it did. I think that is first and foremost due to the fact that Jesus was real and his resurrection was real. But further, I think it's because the example of Christ and the values of his kingdom were imparted to Christians through his Holy Spirit. And they did stuff that was totally counter-cultural and pointed people to Jesus in over the next few centuries. That won out with no need for any swords, any weapons, any political force whatsoever. But finally, let's go back and revisit that word that we were just using a second ago, exile. At the very end of the book, Peter says that he's writing this thing from Babylon. Well, Peter's not in Babylon. We have all kinds of details to tell us that Peter's totally on the other side of the world. He's in Rome. What does he mean by that? Well, Babylon was a metaphor that Peter and others employed when talking about Rome in this era. Why? Maybe it was just coded language so they could sneak letters in and out without seeming like they were subverting Roman authority or Roman culture. I think there's a decent chance that that was part of it. I mean, Peter's writing a letter here saying, don't go around stirring up trouble and being troublemakers, and unsophisticated, overly ambitious Roman law enforcement agent might get their hands on that letter and be like, what I think I see subversion right here. But more than being sneaky, I think using Babylon as a code word for Rome is a way to remind all of these Christians that they are indeed once again a part of the Old Testament story. And the part of the story they find themselves in is a new exile. They're outsiders in a land that is hostile toward them and their values and their God. And they've got to figure out for the time being, maybe for a very long time, what it looks like to live as followers of God in this hostile environment where there are spiritual forces of evil arrayed against them undergirding the resistance they feel on a daily basis. So I don't think Peter's using the word Babylon at the end of this letter is some kind of cheap throw away. I think it's the final evolution of his thought to say, you are a part of this ongoing story of faith. You are a part of us. This story is your story. You are the real deal. And part of being the real deal right now means that you get to join us in experiencing what exile is like. But be faithful in that God is with us. When you visualize a book of 1 Peter, picture Roman Babylon just jumbled together the imagery from those two places in your brain. When you think about the theme, reflect on how Peter's saying that Christians are exiles and God is using those exiles in a foreign place to build his kingdom and bring glory to himself. So remain faithful. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, catch chapter 1 and chapter 5. There's Peter leveled up and where there is a first Peter, there's probably going to be a second Peter. And indeed, there is. And that's what we're going to cover next time around. I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 2nd Peter. Not too long ago we looked at 2nd Timothy, which was the end of the road for Paul. Now we're in 2nd Peter, and this represents the end of the road for Peter. This is another letter written by Peter to the same audience who is writing to. And 1 Peter is a general, mostly Gentile Christian audience in Asia Minor in Turkey. Again, it's in very pro-Roman territory. These are people who have felt under duress and just like everywhere else. False teachers who see an opportunity to exploit this upstart new idea and to glom onto it and get money and ladies out of the deal for themselves. They've showed up from all different stripes and started to insert false teachings. And now apparently they're even mischaracterizing the teachings of Paul to try to throw these people into confusion to separate them from their money and to gain prideful popularity and the following of their own all ostensibly in the name of Jesus. But in reality it's all about these false teachers. Well, just like at the end of 2nd Timothy, Paul knew, he'd been arrested a lot of times. He could tell the difference in different flavors of rest. He knew, oh, this is a big one. I'm not going to survive this. And the tone of the letter reflects it. Likewise, Peter had also taken a beating. He knew when it was a big deal. He knew when it was a little deal. And he could tell that the circumstances surrounding what was going on here, the heat that had been turned up in Rome, the fact that the Christians were a convenient scapegoat for some things that were going wrong in the current administration there in Rome. He's just new. I'm not going to survive this thing. And so maybe this is the only letter that he wrote from that moment of knowledge right before his execution in the late 60s AD. Maybe he wrote others as well. And this is just the one that we have preserved. But either way, the message is very straightforward as he's writing to these Christians who are being prayed upon by false teachers who do not love them the way Peter loves them. False teachers who do not love Christ as they ought to be loving Christ. And so he writes a letter that communicates this message. Following Jesus is costing me dearly. It's going to cost you dearly, and it's totally worth it. So remain faithful in action and belief in your loyalty to Christ. And so on some levels, what we're getting here is Peter's farewell tour. These are the closing remarks. If I could only say one more thing to you, and it had to fit on a little piece of parchment or a little scroll that could only be this big, I guess this is what I would want to say to you. But additionally to that, this is sort of Peter vying for the hearts and the loyalty of these young Christians who are thrown into confusion. And he's trying to get them to follow the teachings of the gospel and Jesus that have been handed down to them from the beginning as opposed to this goofy stuff that was coming in from these false teachers. Well, he does that in three movements and the three chapters of the book pretty much covered these three movements. Though section one only really covers part of chapter one's chapter one. Section one, we're talking first about the action side, obeying Christ and saying faithful to him in your actions, persisting in your faithfulness. And he reminds them of the stuff that he said in his previous letter about how they are fully in God. They are the real deal. They are a part of this big story of redemption and God's people. And here he lists out his own miniature version of Paul's fruits of the spirit that we see at the end of the book of Galatians. And in the context of being the last thing that Peter is going to say to these people, it reads even more beautifully and even more tenderly with him saying, if you get nothing else right, let this be the stuff that is manifest in you for this very reason. Make every effort to add to your faith goodness and to goodness knowledge and to knowledge, self control and to self control, perseverance and to perseverance, godliness and to godliness, brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness love. He and Paul are in lockstep on this and he and Paul are also in lockstep on what this list of virtues means in terms of their strategy. We talked about that when we were looking at first Peter, Jeremiah from the Old Testament, Jesus, who factors pretty prominently in the New Testament, Peter and Paul are all on the same page in saying we're not going to conquer Rome with the sword. We're not going to win some gigantic culture war through deception and manipulation. What we're going to do is faithfully represent Christ and the values of his kingdom while we are in exile, so to speak, in a hostile foreign land and through this salt and light distributed in the middle of this darkness, God will be exalted and people will see the truth of that and respond again. All these virtues that Peter just listed off right here, all the virtues that Paul lists off in Galatians. Those are the ones you would need for this game plan and those are the virtues that are reflective of the values of the kingdom expressed and modeled by Jesus himself. The first movement of this letter then is about staying steadfast in your right action. The second movement in this letter is about being steadfast in right belief. The way that Peter goes at that is to look at a few of the claims that these false teachers have made and then to eviscerate those claims. The false teachers say, Jesus is never coming back. You misunderstood that. He's not actually the king. And Peter says, yes, he is. I saw him in his glory myself and I saw him come back to life. He refutes it with personal testimony. Then the false teachers say, there is no final judgment. Did all get sorted out in this world? And Peter says, no, God will justly judge these false teachers. He will bring it around. And he gives three examples, two of which are in the Old Testament, one of which is peripheral to the Old Testament where Peter seems to be referencing a story from the book of first Enoch. Well, then the false teachers are saying it doesn't really matter what happens with your body because it's all about the spirit anyway. Then Peter says, no, right action is absolutely important. And he calls out the fact that these religious leaders are misconstruing Paul's teaching. He doesn't clarify here in chapter two that he's talking about Paul, but he very much spells it out a little bit later, referencing back to it in chapter three, where he acknowledges even what Paul has written should be thought of as scripture. That's an interesting side note. But Peter says, no, God very much does care about right action. And he very much does call believers to obedience in that regard. And then getting toward the end of chapter two, Peter goes into this robust denunciation of the false teaching and false motives and corrupt character of these religious leaders in a way that is very reminiscent of a verbal beatdown that Peter had a front row seat for in Matthew 23, when Jesus lambasted the religious leaders with the famous seven woes, he declares against them just shortly before he got arrested and went to the cross. And then the third movement in this final work from Peter is all about this Old Testament theme of the day of the Lord. And Peter reminds his audience that God is faithful, that God is patient, that he's drawing more people to himself. He's not just stalling. He's doing this for greater redemptive purposes, but that there will be a day of reckoning. There will be a day when justice happens and all of this gets sorted out. And just from a big picture Bible point of view, I think it's really important that that is coming up again here right at the very end, the closing leg of the race of the whole Bible, because that day of the Lord theme feels like it still hasn't been totally paid off at this point in the Bible. And we're obviously going to get more of that as we get into revelation. The final book of the Bible here in just a little bit. So then Peter, as we know it at least, signs off once and for all saying, therefore dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position, but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever. Amen. And then Peter put his money where his mouth was and he went to his death. When you visualize the book, a second Peter picture Peter in chains. When you think about the theme, reflect on how Peter is saying, following Jesus is costing me, it will cost you and it's totally worth it. So remain faithful to him in action and belief. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get Peter's parting words in chapter three. And now we've collected our level up for second Peter. Next time around, first John, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. This podcast is supported by many of you at patreon.com slash the TMPH podcast.

Music...", "title": "1 John", "url": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/thetenminutebiblehourpodcast/BIBLE62_-_1_John.mp3"}, "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 1 John. The book of 1 John was written by John, and there's a couple people who have that name in early Christian history, but the early church fathers, including people who knew him and knew people who knew him, say that this is John the beloved disciple, John the son of Zebedee, John who wrote the gospel of John, John who also wrote 2nd and 3rd, John, John who wrote Revelation, and John who was the one disciple who didn't die of violent martyr's death, but who instead, according to tradition, goes to the area around Ephesus and sets up shop there and lives out his life doing Christian ministry and writing stuff. So we think it's that John, we got good reasons for thinking it's that John, what we can definitely, definitely even more so say for sure is that 1st, 2nd, and 3rd John are all written by the same guy. It's in the exact same voice, and it's dealing with the exact same problem. What is that problem? Well, I'm so very glad you asked. It looks like the deal is this. A bunch of false teachers, I know it's always the false teachers, they're always showing up and they're always causing problems. Well, that's the deal here again. A bunch of false teachers showed up, and these are teachers whose particular issue started with the divinity of Christ. So they rolled into presumably Ephesus, if this is written by John, it would make sense. That would be the church you would have the most relationship with. So they roll into, let's say, Ephesus, and they start spouting off about Jesus is not the Christ. He is not the promised king. The descendant of David who was to come and reign on the throne forever. He's not the son of God, and they're reverting to some weird hybrid, I guess, of Greek dualistic philosophy, like light and darkness. They're just two sides of the same coin. You can't really have one without the other. This is a classic Greek moral philosophy and understanding of the forces that brought balance to the world. And so they're trying to take that old Greek philosophy and hybridize it with some old Jewish assumptions. And the result is no Christianity at all. The result is a mutant Frankenstein, weird, gross, ugly, twisted up religion that doesn't make any sense or have any foundation at all. So John decides that he is going to write into this problem, not to the false teachers, but to the people who were thrown into confusion by it. Now, this is where you're going to notice a little flavor of difference between what we've seen from Peter and Paul and what we get from John. Paul, from time to time, admittedly, would definitely get mad and he would go really hard at people. Remember backing Galatians when he was talking about the Judaizers who came in and we're like, you all should get circumcised. And Paul's like, oh, yeah, smart guys, we'll have cutting off a little bit of that flesh would help a little bit. Why not go the whole way and cut off the whole thing for even more goodness with God? Paul was chippy and feisty at times. And indeed, in the last book we looked at, we see Peter echoing the aggressive denunciation of the Pharisees that Jesus fired off in Matthew chapter 23. Peter could get pretty hot as well in his writing, but John, well, maybe he just had the benefit of living to a very old age. Maybe he was just wired a little differently. He takes a very different tone, a very gentle, grand fatherly tone with the whole thing. It almost reads to me like he is trying to come off as mildly tottering and a little bit old and like he needs to go over the same point in cycle two or three times with these young folks to remind them of how the things are. There's a gentle, warm, stabilizing tone that I detect in John in this, do we call it a letter? And people generally say it's a letter, but it doesn't read quite like the rest of the letters read. Still, I think it was meant to be distributed and handed around amongst these churches. Maybe letter is the best term for it. Right at the beginning, we see language that is very reminiscent of the gospel of John, which is very reminiscent of the very beginning of the Bible in the book of Genesis. This connects the whole Bible together from beginning to end in a very, I think, overt way. Some might say it's subtle, but all of this is in the beginning God. In other words, this whole redemptive plan from all of the story of the Old Testament through the work of Christ recorded in the gospel of John and on the cross and all the way through the age of the early church. And even as these false teachers come to cause problems, all of that is happening under the purview of God. He is not panicked. He is carrying out his redemptive plan. And then John goes on to say, you know, this light and dark thing, this philosophy that lingers around the edges of your culture and your church and that these false teachers are trying to integrate with the things of Christ. Yeah, it doesn't work. Light and dark, they're not two sides of the same coin. They're not their opposite. They're intention. They're in conflict. And the right understanding of light and dark is that light is desirable and good and dark is not. You want to walk in the light. You want to be Christians, not who have a foot in each world, but who are squarely planted in the light of Christ. John gives us a bit of a thesis starting in verse five. He says, this is the message we've heard from him and declare to you God is light in him. There's no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and don't live by the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he's in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus, his son purifies us from all sin. It looks like the people John's writing to were thrown into such confusion that they weren't even sure if they were Christians or not, because what the false teachers are saying is so different than what they believed and what they'd heard from John and Peter and Paul and even second hand from Jesus. So they're wondering like, who's who's right? Who's the actual Christian here? And what John is saying is, well, I'm going to give you a test. I'm going to give you a way to know if you are walking in the light, if you are indeed a Christian. And what he ends up laying out over the course of this book is a threefold test for whether or not you are indeed a Christian. If these three things exist in your life, probably you are. If these next three things, I'm going to say don't there might be a problem here. It's obedience and love or put another way, right belief, right action and right relationships should be present in the life of the Christian. And rather than giving us a vigorously linear Paul style argument, what we get instead is more of a cyclical argument where John advances this idea of the threefold test, truth, obedience and love. Those are the marks of being a Christian. He spells out the idea that God is light and God is love. And this is truth. It's kind of following a Trinitarian model in that regard. And so he patiently and grandfatherly circles around these three ideas, taking his dear children as he calls them his audience by the hand and walking them through reflection on each of these questions for themselves. And also reflection on each of these questions for the false teachers. Do they say things that are true? Do they live in obedience to the teachings of Christ? Do they love other people? And the conclusion that is evident by the time John is done is that no, these false teachers don't pass the threefold test for being in Christ for walking in the light. But you, dear children, make sure that you do. There's a very important note of clarification that needs to happen here. John is not laying out a threefold path to earning salvation in Christ. If you say things that are true and think things that are true, if you do things that are right and if you love people, then God will receive you into his kingdom. No, no, no, no, what John is providing is a threefold test of whether you are already in Christ that is very much in keeping with the stuff that James, the brother of Jesus wrote back in his letter and that Paul wrote back in his letter to the Galatians about the fruit of the spirit. There are things that should manifest if you are in Christ and John is simplifying that down to three things that somebody who's in turmoil could look at to say, well, am I actually a Christian or not? And further is that other person over there who's saying stuff that sounds weird? Are they actually a Christian or not? When you visualize the book of first John picture light and dark in contrast. When you think about the theme, reflect on how walking in the light produces truth, obedience and love. And finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing and hopefully you do, this is a very powerful book. But if you don't, check out chapter one versus five through ten. This wasn't the only thing that John wrote regarding this particular predicament. We're going to look at the second thing he wrote regarding this situation next time around in second John. I'm Matt.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about 2nd John. The book of 2nd John is a follow-up letter to the book of 1st John, which is presumably written by John the disciple, John the son of Zebedee, John the guy who wrote the gospel of John, John the guy who wrote Revelation. According to all the earliest sources, that's the John who wrote it. What we know for sure is whoever it was, it's the same guy who wrote 1st, 2nd and 3rd John, because it's all dealing with the same situation. And the same situation is that some false teachers came into some churches in Asia Minor, probably around Ephesus, and they started messing with the Christians there and teaching some dualistic, Greek philosophy about light and darkness. And that philosophy couldn't contain what the account of Jesus was. It wasn't compatible with Jesus. So these false teachers started saying, no, he never really had a physical body. The physical world is bad physical things or evil. No, it had to be that Jesus was just a spirit who looked like an actual body. They're trying to force Jesus into their Greek philosophical presuppositions. And it might sound like it's just an absurd little philosophical debate like freshman year of college or something, but it turns out it actually has really far-reaching implications. And it derails these Christians and rattles them. And they're not sure what to make at things anymore. And they're looking at these false teachers and they're like, wait, are they Christians and we're not? Or are we Christians and they're not? Or is Christianity even a thing? And so in a very grandfatherly gentle way in these three letters, John comes along and reassures them and equips them with a three-fold test for whether or not you're in Christ or whether or not the false teachers are in Christ. And the questions to consider are truth, obedience, and love. If those three things are present, well, then you're probably in Christ. If those three things aren't, then whatever is producing not truth, not obedience, and not love, well, that can't be Jesus. In second, John, those exact same themes are repeated. But here, what we're getting is a personal letter with specific instructions about what to do when these false teachers show up. And it's an incredibly short book. So the easiest way for me to relay the content to you is to read it to you. Here we go. This letter is from John the Elder. I'm writing to the chosen lady and to her children who my love in the truth, as does everyone else who knows the truth, because the truth lives in us and will be with us forever. Grace, mercy, and peace, which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father will continue to be with us who live in truth and love. How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according to the truth just as the Father commanded. I'm writing to remind you, dear friends, that we should love one another. This is not a new commandment, but one we've had from the beginning. Love means doing what God has commanded us, and He's commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning. I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny that Jesus Christ came in a real body. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist. Watch out that you don't lose what we've worked so hard to achieve. Be diligent so that you receive your full reward. I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny that Jesus Christ came in a real body. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist. Watch out that you don't lose what we've worked so hard to achieve. Be diligent so that you receive your full reward. Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God, but anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to your meeting and doesn't teach the truth about Christ, don't invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement. Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work. I have much more to say to you, but I don't want to do it with paper and ink. I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our joy will be complete. Greetings from the children of your sister chosen by God. And that's it. So you can see the repetition of the threefold test from back in 1 John. You can see additional specificity as to what exactly is wrong with these false teachers. You can see John saying firmly, Hey, I'm the spiritual leader of this church. I'm spiritual father and I'm telling you, I'm giving you my blessing to reject this teaching outright. It's not true. So it violates part one of the threefold test of whether you're in Christ, but it's going to lead you to violate the other parts that being obedience and love. No. You even welcome them into your home. Don't encourage them because John is saying he views what they're doing as being legitimately destructive and not just some other flavor of Christ following, but completely off the mark and something the Christians there are to reject entirely as harsh as it might sound. When you visualize second John picture, a closed door, one that is closed to false teachers who would come and pray on these Christians. When you think about the theme, reflect on rejecting false teachers and holding to the truth that produces obedience and love. And when it comes to second John, we all have time to read the whole thing. Second John leveled up, but this set of circumstances is not yet resolved. And the third John is going to take us deeper into it next time around. I'm Matt is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about 3rd John. 3rd John is a very personal letter written by the Apostle John, almost surely the son of Zebedee and the guy who wrote the Gospel of John of Revelation as well. Definitely whoever wrote this is the same guy who wrote 1st and 2nd John because all three of these books pertained to the same situation, which is false teachers who were trying to force Jesus into certain Greek philosophical categories and it wasn't working at all. The consequences were disastrous and it undermined the teachings of Jesus and the apostles and it sent the churches probably in Ephesus near where John was living into chaos and confusion. So John counters that by equipping these confused Christians with a threefold test to determine who is indeed walking in the light, who is in Christ, and the threefold test is truth, obedience and love. If you got all three of those things cooking, then probably what undergirds it is Jesus. If you don't have one or more of those things cooking, then probably what undergirds that is not Jesus. In 1 John, he lays out that test and cycles around it and threw it a few different ways to really gently take the reader by the hand and walk them through this for their evaluation of themselves and the false teachers. In 2 John, we get a personal letter that is saying, hey, you have my blessing not to offer hospitality to these false teachers. They're not Christians and if you offer them hospitality and help them and encourage them, you're actually encouraging things that you know full well have done damage to the church. That doesn't sound very nice. Then 2 John might clang a little bit in that regard. But when we look at the damage that had been done by these falsehoods and by these predatory teachers, we understand why John came in like the papa bear and straightened things out, even though that papa bear has a pretty gentle growl. In 3 John, we're getting the most personal of these three letters as John is writing to somebody named Gaius, who seems like a great guy. And John sent some of his disciples and associates to go and teach at this church where Gaius is at. Gaius was like, great, I know John, I recognize this. This is the message we heard from the very beginning about Jesus of Nazareth. I accept you, here's hospitality, and John totally affirms that. But then on the other hand, there's this guy named Diatrophies and apparently he's one of these people who's trying to cram Jesus into certain Greek philosophical categories and it's not working. And Diatrophies is being very aggressive in rejecting the teachers who John sends to get it straightened out, even going so far as excommunicating the people in his little corner of the church who were listening to the people who John sent. So John's going to address all of that the easiest way to really get a feel for the whole letter is just to read it because it's very short and we have time to do it. Goes like this, the elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth, Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health as it goes well with your soul. For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your truth as indeed you are walking in the truth. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth. Beloved, it's a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for these brothers, strangers as they are, who testified to your love before the church. You'll do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God. For they've gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. Therefore, we ought to support people like these that we may be fellow workers for the truth. I've written something to the church, but diatrophies who likes to put himself first does not acknowledge our authority. So if I come, I'll bring up what he's doing, talking wicked nonsense against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers and also stops those who want to and put them out of the church. Beloved, do not imitate evil, but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God. Whoever does evil has not seen God. Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone and from the truth itself. We also add our testimony and you know that our testimony is true. I'd much to write you, but I'd rather not write you with pen and ink. I hope to see you soon and we'll talk face to face. Peace be with you. The friends greet you, greet the friends, each by name. You can see stuff talked about in 1 John all over the place here in 3 John, including the heavy emphasis on walking in the truth, that concept of walking in the light. And also there's carryover from what we got in 2 John about receiving the right teachers and stiff arming the teachers who are participating in this falsehood. It's a beautiful personal letter that demonstrates John's care for his flock. And it also demonstrates his willingness to equip them with very practical measures so they know what to do under pressure. When you visualize 3 John picture Gaius the good, when you think about the theme, reflect on seeking true teaching that nourishes Christians toward obedience and love. And as another one of these really short books, it makes the most sense to just read the whole thing for yourself. 3 John achievement unlocked next time around. We get the little book of Jude.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Jude. When I was a kid, if my brother or sister or I said literally anything, my parents, who were both music majors and did show tunes and stuff, would always come up with a song that connected to whatever we just said, and then they would start singing and everything. And as a kid, you're like, knock it off. Now I look back on it and I miss it. I liked when my mom and dad used to sing to me, inspired by literally anything I said. If you've ever known anybody who is a reference person, that is, if you bring up anything, they can come up with a quote from a movie or a book or a song or whatever, then you are going to feel tremendous familiarity with what is going on in the book of Jude, which pound for pound has got more references to other stuff than probably anything else in the Bible. It's unbelievable how many other things Jude references in what is effectively one page of texts. A teeny tiny little book of the Bible. It's a letter. It's written by Jude, who we know from a passage in Luke and a passage in Mark was one of the brothers of Jesus and like the other brothers of Jesus. They didn't really see it. They didn't know Jesus was alive and doing stuff, but after the resurrection, they came around and James, whose letter we looked at a few pages back and now Jude became significant leaders in the church. And as I mentioned a second ago, apparently this Jude fellow was someone who liked to dive deep into the Old Testament, but not just the Old Testament, also the peripheral books around the Old Testament, including some books that nobody ever even thought about considering canonical or part of the scriptures, but that really informed Jewish lore and Jewish thought and Jewish conversation and Jewish theology. And he freely draws on all of that stuff in this letter. Now we don't know what church that Jude is writing to, but it looks like something has gone off the rails and you're not going to believe what it was. It was false teachers again, and you're probably not going to believe this either, but they failed the three fold test for being Christians laid out by John a couple books earlier. They were greedy. They were sexually licentious, but the church is new and some of these churches fell for it and got thrown into confusion as a result. And just a quick side note here, by the way, false teaching is coming up and practically all of these books we're looking at here in the latter half of the New Testament. And I think it's kind of a compliment really to Christianity for how significant it very quickly became after the life and death and resurrection of Jesus because all these people want in. I mean, they don't want to follow Jesus, but they see that this is a big enough deal, that it's got enough momentum, that it's something that's worth messing with and worth exploiting for their own selfish gain. So that in and of itself, just by looking at the opposition to the church, it gives us a sense of how well and how quickly things have taken off with the followers of Jesus. This letter of Jude looks a lot like second Peter and I don't know who informed to, but pretty clearly one or the other had seen and appreciated the effectiveness of the other letter. And so they embrace a very similar structure in terms of pointing to Old Testament examples, particularly of God judging those people who were leaders who resisted the message of God, resisted the messengers of God. And as was the case with second John and third John, I think the easiest way to give you a sense of the book is just to quickly read you the book. But let me remind you what we talked about earlier. There's a lot of references here. If you don't catch all of them or remember all of them, I think that's absolutely fine. We'll take a second to think about it after we get done reading it. Jude, a servant of Christ Jesus and a brother of James, to those who are the called, loved by God, the father and kept for Jesus Christ. May mercy, peace and love be multiplied to you. Dear friends, although I was eager to write you about the salvation we share, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was delivered to the saints once for all. For some people who were designated for this judgment long ago have come in by stealth, they're ungodly turning the grace of our God into sensuality and denying Jesus Christ, our only master and Lord. Now I want to remind you, although you came to know all these things once and for all, that Jesus saved a people out of Egypt and later destroyed those who did not believe, and the angels who did not keep their own position but abandoned their proper dwelling, he has kept an eternal change and darkness for the judgment on the great day. Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns committed sexual immorality and perversions and serve as an example by undergoing the punishment of eternal fire. In the same way, these people relying on their dreams defile their flesh, reject authority and slander glorious ones. Yet when Michael, the archangel was disputing with the devil in an argument about Moses' body, he didn't dare utter a slanderous condemnation against him, but said, the Lord rebuke you. But these people blaspheme anything they don't understand and what they do understand by instinct, like irrational animals, by these things they're destroyed, woe to them, for they've gone the way of Cain, they have plunged into Balaam's error for profit and they have perished in Cora's rebellion. These people are like blemishes at your love feasts as they eat with you without reverence. They're shepherds who only look after themselves, their waterless clouds carried along by winds, trees and laid autumn, fruitless, twice dead and uprooted, their wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shameful deeds, wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever. It was about these that Enoch and the seventh generation from Adam prophesied. Look, the Lord comes with tens of thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly concerning all the ungodly acts they've done in an ungodly way and concerning all the harsh things ungodly sinners have said against him. These people are discontented grumblers living according to their desires, their mouths that are arrogant words, flattering people for their own advantage. You, dear friends, remember what was predicted by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. They told you in the end times there will be scoffers living according to their own ungodly desires. These people create divisions and are worldly not having the spirit, but you, dear friends, as you build yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God waiting expectantly for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life. And you see on those who waver save others by snatching them from the fire have mercy on others, but with fear hating even the garment defiled by the flesh. Now to him who's able to protect you from stumbling and to make you stand in the presence of his glory without blemish and with great joy to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory, majesty, power and authority before all time now and forever. Amen. I'm not sure I caught all the references in there, but by my count there are 10 plus references to things in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. Did you hear he acknowledged the New Testament apostles as well? And it looks like there are three at least nods to stuff that is totally outside the Bible, two nods to the book of Enoch and then an allusion to this old text called the Assumption of Moses. All of these things would have been in circulation and popular at that time. And so Jude is drawing on all kinds of references and super loaded stories with very loaded cautionary tales that everybody in his audience would have resonated with immediately where you and I have to plow through it and work pretty hard to extract what each of those references was supposed to mean. Jude is one of those guys who knows his audience very well and is fluent in the references they would be fluent in, but the bottom line would seem to be there's a bunch of false teachers, their frauds, they're messing with you guys again. Avoid them entirely. God will judge them and be careful. This stuff does spread if you don't check it. So make sure you check it when you visualize the book of Jude picture Moses body, not because it necessarily tells the whole story of Jude, but because it's such a unique thing and it'll help you remember and recall stuff from the book of Jude. When you think about the theme reflect on how today's false teachers are cut from the same cloth as the false teachers of old and to resist them, Christian should build on the foundation of the gospel. And in terms of reading, it's another short one. So if you want to read it, you should have time to get through that pretty quickly. Jude leveled up next time around. We got revelation and that's the last book of the Bible. So that's pretty exciting. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Revelation. My friends, we've come to the end of the road. Today we're talking about the book of Revelation, and it's the last book of the Bible. And I suppose anytime you get to the last book in a series of books or the last movie in a series of movies, wonder, is the finale going to be any good? Do the people who have their hands on the wheel of this storytelling, do they understand the story they've been telling? Do they understand their own characters? Do they know what needs to happen to land the plane properly? And if you've been a consumer of media over the last 20, 30 years, you know that the answer is often no that shows don't end in satisfying ways, books don't end in satisfying ways. But here in the book of Revelation, the payoff is incredible. It rounds out a multifaceted, multi-millennial story in a way that looks to the future and pays off everything that has been set up. It pays off all the prophecies, all the narrative arcs, all of the theological arcs, all of the historical arcs, all of the injustices and the villains who didn't get it. That all gets addressed as well. It is a magnificent completion to a magnificent book. Now look, the New Testament has showed us a beautiful new paradigm, the paradigm at the age of the church. Jesus came died on the cross was resurrected. The Holy Spirit shows up and dwells within his people like God used to dwell in the temples of your. This is a new paradigm. Grace is the name of the game front and center. God's forgiveness is what makes union with God possible, but still their physical bodies and there's evil and sin and corruption and darkness and lies and injustice in the world. And we're not in the perfect paradigm yet, but at the end of Revelation, we get a look at even yet a further completion of that paradigm, one where all of the stuff that is destructive and broken, all of the consequences of the fallenness of the world and sin are resolved. Why am I telling you all of this on the front end instead of trying to summarize everything about the book of Revelation and painstaking detail? Well, because of an interpretive bias that I have about the book of Revelation. Look, there are two things that often get done with this document. Thing number one is try to solve every single image and riddle and numerical allegory that is present within the thing to try to figure out who's the Antichrist and what's the dragon? Which one of the beasts is the which beast is which horn seal trumpet? Which judgment are we on right now? What's the timeline and what's the date when Jesus is going to come back? Those are the same questions that the disciples were asking getting toward the end of the book of Matthew in the closing hours of Jesus life. They were like, well, can you just give us the timeline, please? And instead of giving them the timeline, Jesus gave them, I guess what you'd call a little preview of what is recorded in the book of Revelation. And at the end of that little preview, he gives them a bonus addendum to that talk saying that nobody knows the day or the hour except for the father. So the point being you're to live expectantly as people who know that this end game to history is unfolding and will unfolding completion to the redemptive plan will happen. But I'm not giving you the exact timeline on that. Well, it's really easy to pick up the book of Revelation with the same impulse that the disciples had, right? Like, I want to know what just went through the whole Bible. Also, I look around planet earth and I see a bunch of stupid stuff. This seems really broken and bad. Maybe it's just recency bias, but it seems like it's maybe getting broken or in batter at times. I don't know. Could be that we're headed toward some sort of resurgence of good stuff as well. But the point is, I get why they asked. I get the pressures we feel in life. I get the helplessness that we feel as we look at the world. And I understand if somebody could come to the book of Revelation and be like, I'm going to decode this thing. I'm going to crack the code. I'm going to crack the symbols and I'm going to solve it once and for all that right there. What I just described over the last couple of minutes is a theological bias. Someone could bring with them to the book of Revelation. Another theological bias someone could bring with them to the book of Revelation is to say, I want the payoff to the Bible. I accept that I'm not going to be able to solve all of the symbols. I accept that I'm not going to be able to do all of the math. And I accept and gladly forfeit my imagined right to have a timeline here and to know the day and the hour that all of these things are going to take place. But what I'm looking for is completion to this story. Even if it's broad strokes, I want to know how it wraps up. Is it good? Can I celebrate it? Is it a happy ending? Does God end up winning? The lift that the book of Revelation is doing first and foremost is to give us the big picture of how history ultimately unfolds and God's ultimate victory over the serpent Satan evil death in justice or to use the term I keep on using the culmination of God's redemptive plan. So in light of that, here's the big picture of the flow of Revelation. It's written by John. John specifically names himself as the author. And even though as a genre, Revelation is what's called an apocalypse. It kind of looks like Ezekiel and Daniel to get this wild exotic imagery about how future things are going to unfold. But in the middle of this larger apocalyptic work of literature, we also kind of get some many epistles to the churches like Paul used to write except this time around it's from Jesus himself. Now, there's seven churches that get addressed here in the early going by Jesus. And they've all been around for a while at this point. The book of Revelation is probably written pretty close to the turn of the century getting into the nineties AD right toward the end of the life of the apostle John. And the book seems very eager to get on to the apocalypse side, but it bridges the gap between the age of the church and the end of all things by speaking into the age of the church while it still exists with these opening letters. This stuff reads pretty straightforward. Jesus likes some of what he's seeing there. He doesn't like some of what he's seeing there. He offers corrections, but then when we turn the page into chapter four, visually and tonally things start to change were introduced to this very prominent character throughout the book of Revelation who is a lamb, but the lamb has been slain, which is a pretty graphic image. And clearly it's pointing to Christ, the one who John the Baptist called the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, the ultimate sacrificial lamb. But this lamb isn't dead. The lamb is alive, raised and active in the unfolding of these final events at the end of time. And what we see through the middle of the book is that there's a scroll that can't be open and there's something very, very important in there. And John is sad as he looks at it needs to be open. Well, it turns out that this lamb who was slain is the one who can open it. And there's this musical celebration about that. You're worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were slaughtered and you purchased people for God by your blood from every tribe and language and people and nation. You make them a kingdom and priests to our God and they will reign on the earth. And every time we hear words like this throughout the book of Revelation, it's part of this heavenly gathering of different characters, some of which look very foreign, some of which look like saints who are saying the praises of God and the praises of Christ and celebrating the work of the lamb. And then we get this language right after that here in chapter five, worthy is the lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise. And from here through roughly the next 10 ish chapters, we see three individual sets of judgments that are unleashed on the world and the unjust nations of the world as seven scrolls are opened as seven seals are opened and as seven trumpets are blasted by angels or maybe what we're seeing there is a repetition of the same set of seven judgments from three different angles. Either way, the result is the same. The nations are like, yeah, that's a lot and that don't get me wrong. That hurts. But we're probably not going to repent and my friends, having just gone through the whole Bible together, if you read the book of Revelation for yourself, there's going to be imagery and language here that just pops for you from other things that we've seen. For the imagery of the locus that we get from the book of Joel, that is here. Remember Ezekiel eating a scroll bizarre. Well, they have John do the same thing here in the book of Revelation. And then Zechariah and Ezekiel use the imagery of the measuring rod. This kind of stuff, it's just all over the book of Revelation. And there's too much for us to dive into meaningfully as we're having this conversation. Long story short, there are a couple of witnesses who show up and they say the things that are true and point to the authority of God, but the nations aren't into it and they get martyred, but then they're immediately resurrected. And at this point, the nations start to blink and they're like, well, maybe we should repent for some of this lifelong evil that we've been doing. This is a very important note. Throughout the book of Revelation, we're seeing two distinct evil presences who are there who need to be dealt with by God, by Christ, the conqueror. And one is the serpent, that ancient snake Satan, the devil himself. And it seems like Revelation is telling us that all the appearances of this accuser, this evil one in all his different forms throughout the Bible, they're all this same actual personal character who is in opposition to the work of God and who over a series of three encounters, God ultimately defeats by the very end of the book. And then the other evil is the nations of the world touched by sin. These ambassadors of injustice and evil and perpetrators of wickedness and oppression that all just seems to flow down river and never gets addressed. They just keep doing it. They shed blood, they spout lies, then they memory hold the lies and move on to the next exploitative lies. Even as you and I live, it seems like that's never going to get dealt with. But in Revelation, it gets dealt with. And in the same way that Peter used Babylon as a metaphor for all of the evil nations of the world. So Revelation seems to lean into that as well at times using the language of Babylon itself and other times using the language of this idolatrous, licentious woman who is representative of Babylon itself, who drinks the blood of the saints and is the embodiment of all the worldly evil that has happened ever. And as we come down to the last three or four chapters of the book, this is where the payoff to everything we've seen before really kicks in. And it's, it's amazing. It's terrifying. It's justice. And as you read it, you're both vindicated and thankful that something is finally being done. But also you can't help but immediately feel like, whoa, I don't want to get swept up in that. I want to be marked by the lamb. I want to be within the household, within the family of faith, because this judgment is terrifying. It's awe inspiring. It's the day of the Lord payoff that we had all throughout the minor prophets in the Old Testament. Babylon is defeated. The beasts that represent the evil stuff are defeated. The dragon that ancient serpent, the devil that is Satan is bound up for a thousand year reign of Christ. People debate exactly when those thousand years happened, then briefly liberated again, only to be finally crushed and defeated by God. And in the midst of all of that, the king arrives this time around, not riding on a humble donkey to a mixed reception. This time around, he shows up like a conqueror on a war horse and his words are more powerful than any weapon of war that has ever been fashioned. And it can lay waste to everything as he sees fit to bring judgment and truth as he sees fit. And after all the evil is defeated, creation is made new. And there's this new Jerusalem where God doesn't dwell in a temple in a cordoned off place where you can't go. But now the holiness and righteousness of God is on his people. And so the people enjoy true fellowship with God once again, like the Garden of Eden, but even better as God's spirit dwells among them fully, realizing the promises God made through the prophets toward the end of the Old Testament. As a series finale, you can't really ask for anything better than that. It is a beautiful completion of the story and payoff of all of the themes. I have no sense of what the actual timeline is or how it works. I'm not qualified to sort that out. And even if I were, I still think it might end up being a fool's errand, but grace and peace to everybody who wants to go and try to read this document that way and track it down. But the one thing, regardless of how anybody comes at it, that we all should be able to take from this as honest, fair-minded readers is that God's victory is absolute and complete and public. And there is no more arguing or dispute. All of the things are settled and it's beautiful and God dwells among his people. And therefore, if somebody like you or me goes through this whole Bible, even if you were a complete outsider to it at the beginning and you're like, yeah, it seems like there's a God behind that. And like it's probably the real one. And I would like to be a part of that kingdom than what revelation prompts us toward is living and thinking and prioritizing and orienting in a way that is in keeping with this vision of the future and this amazing ending to God's redemptive plan. When you visualize a book or revelation picture, the lamb who is slain, when you think about the theme, reflect on it being an overview of all of theology that points toward the end of history and the success of God's redemptive plan. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to catch chapter five in chapters 18 through 22. Okay. I got three things I want to say quickly on the way out the door as we wrap up this final episode in our series going through the Bible. One, I know a bunch of you are here because you've been around the Bible a lot. And from the get go, you were like, I do think there's a God in that God's behind the Bible. I want to know more about it. Awesome. I absolutely love that we just did this together. But I know there are a bunch of you because I've heard from you who either weren't sure or still aren't sure what to make of any of that. Maybe you just wanted to understand this better. And I have mountains of respect for you, putting in the energy and time to try to understand it for what it is as you work through your journey of life and journey of faith. I'm thrilled that you're here. I hope we get to keep having conversations together. You can't hear it, but I am tipping my hat to you as we speak. Second thing on the way out the door, I'm going to do three episodes. One big look at the Old Testament, one big look at the New Testament and then some final thoughts on this whole exercise to round out this week. And then third thing I want to tell you, we're going to start on a new series, which is on the book of Esther. And I would be so honored if you would consider joining me for it. I'm really excited about the content. It takes us into the world of Persia. It's the hyper interesting era. I think it's going to be so much fun. I'd be honored if you'd join me and maybe even consider inviting a friend. I'm excited to take a big picture. Look at everything we've done and maybe spike the football together over the next three days. We'll catch you then. And at this is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. And this one is about the whole Old Testament. Hello everyone, my name is Matt Whitman and I just finished reading the Bible several, several times through. I don't know actually how to count it because there's some of these books that I had to read a lot. Some of them I read maybe only twice in the last few months. But here's the thing, at the end of all the episodes, we're being honest with each other and the reality is you all have jobs and stuff to do. And I mean literally this is what I do. I hang out in my basement and I read the Bible and then I talk into this microphone and then sometimes you listen to it, it's real cool when you do or you don't have to, it's cool, whatever. So I have time to do this because you've made it possible for me to have time to do this. So that means that at the end of each of the episodes, I've tried to give you the quick version of a book. Like, hey, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, just make sure you go and read this part. And that way, if you're swamped right now, you can at least get a feel for each of these books. Well, this episode is the, if you didn't have time to listen to the whole series or if you did have time, but you don't have time to go back and listen to it again to internalize it more, make sure you at least catch this episode because we're going to cover the big story of the Old Testament and it's going to happen real fast and I'm already burning time by yammering on and on and on. So here's what I see. The Old Testament holds itself out as starting in time immemorial and that's not even the right word because it's even before time immemorial. It's before time was even really a thing where there were any measurable factors by which you could tell there was time. And so there's a theological reality in the very opening moments of the Bible, which is God predates everything about existence as we know it and all of the orienting factors from the physical world as we understand it. God predates that as well. He is being, he is essence, he transcends all of it. So right from the beginning, we get a sense that this God character is completely other. He's operating on a different plane in a different greater reality with the ability to push and pull and navigate things for his purposes in ways that are totally not accessible, not possible for any mortal created finite physical being like you or me. So then out of nothing, God creates existence in the physical world and he creates people in his image. But then along comes this shady serpent character and the serpents like, I'm opposed to the plan of God. So here's a way that I can wreck it and through the serpent's temptation and influence, the woman and the man sin and now we get to the fork in the road. Will God say, I made a thing. It didn't work out. He's going to make another thing and see if this one goes better or was God's plan, who was surprised by nothing all along to redeem the whole dang mess and he made stuff knowing full well it would go off the rails because there was some point about himself or something he wanted to accomplish in redeeming. Well, thankfully it's the latter and he embarks on this redemptive plan. And right here is where we get the first hint, the first initial promise that there is going to be one who is going to come and crush this whole system that is represented by the serpent and how the serpent thinks and opposes God. And so this whole proposition of redemption is wrapped up in that character, but we don't know much about that character yet. Then after that, we go through this whole primeval age, who knows how much time is covered in there, but there are a bunch of different incidents that demonstrate that humanity is not going to get this figured out. He has a problem that humanity cannot solve and a new paradigm is going to be needed for humanity to be made right with God. Well, then we get into the super ancient, but not maximum ancient part of the Old Testament where we meet a guy named Abraham. God makes a special covenant with Abraham saying that the redemptive plan is going to flow through him big time paraphrase there, but it's a fair paraphrase and that God is going to make a great nation with tons of descendants out of Abraham and that all the nations will be blessed through him. Ah ha, now we're getting a clearer picture. This looks like a regional local patron ethnic deity kind of situation, but this one's different. This one's going to go global. This one was always for everybody. This is wild. Abraham's descendants have all kinds of sorted adventures up and down. And ultimately, a lot of oversimplifying here, it's 12 of Abraham's great grandkids who after a period of slavery in Egypt, their descendants become the 12 tribes of Israel. And after Moses, one of their great leaders receives the law from God, which enables them to have some interaction with a God as holy as this one, they move into the promised land of Canaan. They conquer it in the book of Joshua, and then they promptly begin to fall apart and make all the mistakes that all of humans have ever made in the era of the judges. These are a complete moral dumpster fire in the age described in the books of first and second Samuel. We see the people are like, I guess we need a king. And despite warnings, the kings take you down a dark path. They're like, now we really want one. And so they get one and predictably, even though there's some good stuff there in the early going with Saul and then David and then Solomon, the kingdom splits up into north and south and they start fighting and they have tons of corrupt kings and pretty much nothing goes right up in the north. But there are a couple of really notable good things that do come out of this early era of the kings. And that is first a promise that God makes to David. David decides that God needs a permanent dwelling place where he can live in the holy of holies amongst his people. He's like, I'm going to build you a great temple. And God's like, nope, I'm going to have one of your descendants do that, but I'm going to give you something instead. And it's a promise that there is going to be a line of kings that come from you, David. And in spite of all of your flaws and your problems, this lineage will never end. And one is going to come down the road who will be the great king who will reign forever on your throne. And the intonation is that this is that through line of redemption. We've been tracking so far through the Old Testament. So that's exciting. And then the other good thing that comes out of the early age of the kings is that Solomon, the son of David does go ahead and build a temple, a permanent dwelling place for God. And it is a very impressive temple. But as amazing as that temple must have been to behold, it cannot withstand the societal rot, the societal systemic evil and injustice and sin of the people and the horrible leadership that is always on display in the northern kingdom of Israel and in the southern kingdom of Judah. Those are the two different kingdoms of the descendants of Abraham that emerged, one in the north, one in the south. And so after a bunch of really tumultuous interactions with their neighbors, the northern kingdom falls to Assyria in 722 BC and is lost to history, just gone. And then sometime later in 586 BC, the southern kingdom falls to the new big bad empire on the block that's come along by this point that is Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. And in the process of that fall, the temple that Solomon built for God to dwell among his people is destroyed and left in ruins. And pretty much all of the people who remain who are descended from Abraham are taken far off to the east in captivity in Babylon. But that's not the end of the story. During this era of the kings and during this time of exile that was initiated in 586, God sends all these prophets to talk about how God is judging what's wrong with his people, but also that God is keeping his promises and that the redemptive plan is still on. And these prophets keep fleshing out the idea of the Messiah, this Redeemer who was predicted clear back in the garden with the promise of one would crush the head of the serpent. And in addition to rightly keeping hope alive by pointing to more and more specifics about this Messiah who is still to come and reign on the throne of David forever, the prophets also talk about a narrative, a direction, a future vision for all of history and how things are going to play out. And they talk about this concept of the day of the Lord, which looks like it is partly realized in ancient history, but will ultimately be realized in the future in a day that holds terror for the evil kings and empires, but awe and glory and rejoicing for those who have been oppressed and the victims of injustice and for those who are found to be in God. And as we find out later caught up in the redemptive work of the Messiah who he is yet to send. Eventually the narrative of the Old Testament rounds out with the Babylonians getting defeated by the Persians and then the Persians taking a different tack and being like, you know what, let's let you go back and rebuild this thing. Process of rebuilding gets going in the very late 500s. B.C.s. I was talking like 500 years before the birth of Jesus and the building isn't easy. The politics of Persia get in the way, but over the course of the reigns of a few great kings of Persia, a second temple is built, though it's admittedly smaller and more modest. The walls of Jerusalem are reestablished. The priesthood gets back to work doing the sacrifices and all of the life of the temple stuff in Jerusalem. And even though there's a ton of positivity and the preservation of the line of David and the mechanism by which all the prophecies pointing toward the Messiah might be fulfilled, we still close out the Old Testament feeling like, hmm, the lessons have not really been learned here. And even if those lessons could be learned, it looks as though humanity is simply incapable of solving their own problems, of atoning forward, preventing managing their own sin. And for the attentive reader, the Old Testament wraps up begging for a new paradigm in this relationship between God and man, because humanity is clearly not going to be able to hold up their end of the bargain. Humanity clearly is not going to be able to solve its own problems. We're going to need something as we roll toward the New Testament that is way more God heavy in terms of him doing the heavy lift on this redemptive work. When you visualize the Old Testament, picture stone tablets on which the law of God is written. When you think about the theme of the Old Testament, reflect on how God will redeem despite human resistance and failure along the way. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, which would be understandable, let me give you three passages that I think are particularly important. Genesis 12, 1 through 3, 2 Samuel 7, the whole chapter, and then go and catch Isaiah 48, 9 through 11, which tells you a little bit about God's motives in seeing this whole thing through. And with that, coupled with having gone through each book individually together, I think we have earned our level up sound on the Old Testament. Okay. If you haven't figured it out by now, next time around, we're going to do the too long did not listen version of the New Testament or for those of you who did listen to all of it, the helpful recap and summary of all of it so we can see the whole thing as one big picture and appreciate the pay offs that come at the end all that much more. Don't forget, if you are listening to this in real time, we are just three episodes away from starting our next series on the book of Esther. It's going to be fascinating and fun. I think you're going to love it and I would be honored if you'd consider marking that on your calendars and inviting somebody else to be apart as well. All right. I think that's good for today. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon. This podcast is supported by many of you at patreon.com slash the TMVH podcast.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story and this one is about the whole New Testament. Hello my friends! Last time around we did a great big picture gigantic overview of the Old Testament. This time around we're going to do the same thing with the New Testament. The Old Testament doesn't lead right over into the New Testament though. There's that in between time that we talked about at length in a bonus episode and the simple version of that time is this. The Persians are on the scene at the very end of the Old Testament but then Alexander the Great and his Greek-ish armies conquer Persia and bloodlessly conquer Jerusalem. Then Alexander the Great dies young. His generals divide up his massive empire and after a little bit of passing things around the Seleucid Empire, a Greek empire comes to control the Jewish people in Jerusalem and what would later be called Judea. That does not go well and the Jews finally are like we've had enough of the idolatry and everything else and they throw off their Greek overlords and they establish their own kingdom that runs from the mid-160s BC into the mid-60s BC. And for that hundred years we get one more reminder that we are in need of a new paradigm and that humanity cannot get out of its own way. It's a corrupt mess that kingdom does not go well and eventually it goes so badly that they have to invite this new upstart empire from way out west, the Romans to come in and settle things down and Rome never gives back control after they show up. And eventually the proud independent Hesmonian dynasty of the Jewish people gives way to them being a subject state and then a client king state under the authority of Rome and occupied by Roman government and Roman soldiers. So by the time Jesus is born there's a lot of different opinions about who the Messiah ought to be ranging from political military leader who can get rid of the Romans and establish yet another kingdom all the way over to people who've all been given up on the Messiah. Jesus birth happens while a not even really Jewish guy is the Roman sponsored local king, a guy named Herod the Great, but over him is Caesar Augustus, the first emperor of all of Rome and Jesus gets born in Bethlehem just as the prophets had predicted in everything about his birth to the Virgin Mary is in keeping with all the predictions about the Messiah in the Old Testament and everything about his lineage is in keeping with the line of David because the Messiah would have to be from the line of David. And so the pedigree is right. We don't know much about Jesus yet when he's a teeny tiny little baby, but even the nations or representatives from the nations come to worship him in the very early going. There are signs in his youth that it looks like he is pretty special and pretty remarkable, but it goes public and it goes big when around the age of 30 he gets baptized by his cousin, John the Baptist who has led a religious revival out in the wilds looking like something of a wild man himself and at Jesus baptism, the father and the Holy Spirit both show up affirming Jesus as well. I mean, how could you miss it? The Messiah and the father even says this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased and we landed on pretty thick here. It's looking like this is probably going to be the Messiah, but given how busted up the psyche and the cultural memory of the Jewish people is and given how busted up their religious situation is and how loyalties are all divided their calluses and cynicism that have taken over. It's not going to be as easy as just being like, okay, well, I'm descended from the right people on the Messiah. You can trust me. Everybody follow God now. It doesn't work like that. But in the early going, there is a lot of reason to be optimistic. Jesus recruits an inner circle of followers and he starts doing miraculous stuff and teaching brilliant things and people are very compelled by it. It looks like in the early going, there's a big public speech where Jesus takes his disciples up on a mountainside and starts to teach them. And in the audience as well are people who aren't quite sure what to make of Jesus as well as people who kind of have a problem with it and are initially very put off and eventually get so put off that they end up killing him. But in this big speech, Jesus lays out that he is the fulfillment and the completion of the whole Old Testament story, all the stuff that the prophets were saying, all the narrative arcs from all of the stories and all of the characters at all points to him. And indeed, all of the law about the sacrificial system and the temple and just everything about that robust multifaceted story is completed in Jesus of Nazareth. Well, everybody's impressed with the speech. They're all like, dang, he taught with legitimate authority, not like our teachers of the law. Jesus is different, but it's a really big claim. And so people are wondering, can he back up those amazing words with action? Well, what we get in the ensuing months of Jesus's story is affirmation that, yeah, indeed, he can back that up with action. He demonstrates power and authority over pretty much everything, every hurdle that we encounter in human life, including the really big stuff, like the physical, natural world around us and distance and time and the physical body and the existence of matter and non matter that disease. He's got power over all of that. He's got the power to note things that he could not know that other people are thinking. He's got power over the spiritual world, millions of darkness invisible forces. He can handle all of that. And he's even got power over death, which is obviously the big one. But perhaps the most stunning power of all, maybe the reason, at least in part, that all of this power was demonstrated. The point to this one power is he has the power and authority to forgive sins, to resolve that thing that separates people from God. He can forgive sins. He can do that. And indeed, he links his miracles to his power to forgive sins. So clearly, whatever he's doing is about more than just breaking the laws of time and space to impress people, it's about taking a swing at the biggest, grandest problems of all of existence. Well, this is very threatening to the religious leaders. They're supposed to be the mediators between God and men. They're the ones who are supposed to be the mediators of when God dishes out things like forgiveness. And if Jesus is what he says, he is, then why do they even exist? Over the course of his life, Jesus is rightly identified as the Christ, the Messiah, the one who was promised to sit on the throne of David forever, the son of God, God in the flesh, God himself. And that's just too much for the religious leadership who finally figure out a way to weasel him into a Roman execution. Pontius Pilate is the one who ultimately slams down the gavel and pronounces the sentence. But it was entirely at the behest of the religious leadership of the day. Jesus goes and dies on a cross. But then as he predicted three days later, he comes back to life and he does so in front of a whole bunch of witnesses and not just witnesses who like him, witnesses who aren't rooting for him. And the religious leaders can't produce the body and Jesus empowers his disciples to take the message and run with it before he ascends into heaven and gives them the Holy Spirit with the bizarre imagery of tongues of fire over their heads. This little group of Jesus followers starts speaking in Jerusalem and languages that theoretically don't speak, but everybody's understanding the message of Jesus in their own language and thousands of people start signing up to follow Jesus immediately. And that does not seem to ever lose pace throughout the entire Bible story. Even when the religious leadership starts cracking down on Jesus disciples and the next generation of disciples after that, even killing them, it does nothing to dissuade them. They just communicate the message of Jesus harder and miraculous stuff keeps happening. And indeed, one of the people who was initially killing the Jewish people ends up converting to faith in Christ after an encounter with the risen Jesus on his way up to hurt more Christians in Damascus. And then this fellow, whose name was Saul and eventually comes to be known as Paul, starts making these missionary journeys all around the Mediterranean world, telling people in ways that they would understand in their given culture and community who Jesus is and how this supplies to them. And all of a sudden the Gentiles are in. This isn't even just a Jewish thing anymore. It goes global in a matter of a few years. Now these churches aren't perfect. And so Paul and others are always writing back and forth, trying to help them navigate what it is to be a Christian in their community in the face of persecution. And ultimately, even though the big names in terms of early Christian leaders like James, the brother of Jesus, who was the head of the church in Jerusalem and Peter, the most prominent of Jesus immediate circle of disciples. And Paul, the disciple to the Gentiles, even though those guys and all the big name disciples who were with Jesus other than John meet fantastically gory ends as martyrs for the message of Christ. It doesn't slow anything down. More people keep becoming Christians. They live with the values of the kingdom that Christ was talking about clear back in that sermon on the Mount. And indeed, the church has never looked back since becoming the biggest global phenomenon in the history of anything ever. And it's not even close in the same way that the first book of the Old Testament looks back to the very dawn of time and even beyond. So the final book in the New Testament looks forward beyond and all the way into the day of the Lord, the era, the time, the moment when everything gets set right. The evil is judged and corrected. The evil nations are finally called to account and Christ's kingdom is established and realized in a visible obvious way. And there's a new Jerusalem and God's people are with him and God's spirit dwells with them into eternity. On the whole, I think it's a really good story. If you haven't had a chance to read the whole thing, I encourage you to just pick it up and start chewing through it because it's great. When you visualize a New Testament picture, Jesus Christ crucified and then risen. When you think about the theme, reflect on Jesus, who is the Messiah and the King who was promised, who died and was resurrected for the sins of the world and will return in justice and power to reign forever. Also implied in that theme is that you fit in there somehow. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, try to get John and Romans. Cue the New Testament level up sound. Hey, we got one more episode rounding out this series on this whole journey through the Bible. We've done together. And then on Monday, we start the new one on the Book of Esther and I would be elated if you would consider being a part of that. I'm throwing a ton of work at it right now and I'm so excited for what we're going to get into. Finally, I have a request. If you like this stuff and it's been fun, would you leave a review on any and all podcast apps? Obviously, it's always encouraging myself to read that and I do read all of those. But also, podcast apps like to recommend podcasts that get reviews. And so if you go and review this program on any and all podcast apps, it really helps to get new people involved in the conversation and I want that to happen. All right, final big picture thoughts on this whole project tomorrow and then we're on to Esther after that. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.

Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's The Grand Finale. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and you and I just finished up a thing together. We went through the whole Bible one book per day until we're done, and I feel really good about it. I've got a much better sense of how the Bible works than I ever have before than maybe you just read through the Bible, right along with me. Maybe you went and picked up some of the readings here and there to get a sense of different stuff. But for me, wow, this was humbling. I guess I genuinely thought at the outset of this that, well, you know, all that time I've spent reading the Bible and everything. I think I should be able to knock this out. It shouldn't be too tough. I was wrong. It was tough. This is very hard. I am reminded that this is a complex book with a lot going on with a lot of words that covers a lot of history. And there's a lot of cross-referencing and trying to figure out how this relates to that that you got to think about. And it's cool. I mean, it's part of the enchantment of the Bible that makes you want to keep coming back as you feel like it is a very, very deep well. But it pushed me. This was super, super hard in a good way. I have never in my life been as saturated in Bible as I have been for the last three and a half, four months, whatever it's been. What an amazing feeling to have that much Bible in my brain at once. I've never felt that before. And it's not like I have the whole thing, you know, never eyes drawn, locked down. I find myself already going back and re-listening to episodes from the series to be like, okay, now what happened in that book again? And what did I see there? And like, okay, oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. So I'm already using this as a resource for myself as well. But I will say this, I've never had this much Bible in my active, readily accessible memory part of my brain at once ever in my entire life. And so as I go around through life, just, you know, doing business and running around town and hanging out with friends and watching a movie or a TV show or playing sports or listening to music or looking at Twitter or whatever, it is amazing. How much stuff from the Bible is popping into my mind every time I see anything? I'm like, oh, yeah, that's just like that thing from Joel. Oh, it's totally like what Amos said in that one place. Well, remember that thing from Jude? It's just like that. And I think that's pretty fun. Even if obviously I don't have a comprehensive understanding of the entire Bible at the level that the real true Bible mega genius scholars do. But I know that there's a wide variety of places that you are coming from as you have gone through the Bible with me here. I know that there's some of you who are absolutely blessed with a gift of faith and clarity and vision for things that are spiritual and involve God. And you see that in every moment of your life and you just wanted an excuse to spend more time around the Bible because it's life giving and clarifying for you. Hopefully this is a useful exercise. I know that also some of you who are listening are a little more like me where you just can't help but have some of the skepticism and some of the obnoxious, raise your hand and ask questions every five seconds kind of approach to the thing. But also there's joy in the discovery of how it hangs together. And if you're like me, I'm imagining this was an encouraging process for you because it's one of those deals where you look close almost kind of peering through your fingers like, man, I really think there's a God behind this and it'd be really cool if there were. And all right, we're going to go dive deep into the Bible and let's see what we see. And then you look close with me and you're like, huh, this is even better than I thought it was this smacks of truth and continuity and even so many of the critiques that might spring into my own mind or that I hear from other people. No, the Bible seems to be able to bear the weight of those pretty well. I know that there are others of you who have been around church and then some went wrong. I don't know. It was something inside. It was a church thing. Maybe some kind of calamity. I really, really get that. Maybe you just numb from the spirit of the age and that 80s, 90s, early 2000s, youth group kind of Christianity made a lot of sense. And then things got weird culturally. And I know for some of you, crisis is the right word and you miss when there was clarity to things spiritually and about God and you would welcome that. But also you feel a degree of turmoil about it and a degree of turmoil about going to church. I get it. I hope that for you going through this process, it eliminated the middle man as much as possible and put you in a place where you could quickly digest a whole bunch of Bible and Bible ideas. And maybe hit the reset button a little bit and go back to the basics of what the whole thing, the whole narrative of God and the Bible about all of history and where people fit. Maybe you could hit the reset button on that a little bit and find some encouragement in it. I know there are others of you who are just straight up. Unpersuaded that there is a God at all. But you're intrigued by religion. You are highly empathetic and you care about robust systems of thought that inform other people's lives and assumptions and you looked at this and you were like, huh, yeah, this would be a relatively efficient way to understand this very influential document and I'll give it a go. As I've said before, I have huge respect for that level of thinking outside of yourself and that level of intellectual curiosity. And for you, I hope that at minimum, you come away going, man, there really is a tremendous amount of internal cohesion to that. And maybe at a maximum, I don't know, I'll just straight up say it. I hope you come away from looking that closely at the Bible and you're like, well, maybe there is a God. I want to think about this some more. And further, I know that there are a bunch of people listening to this who do believe there's a God, but you have a completely different set of convictions about that than I do. Maybe from completely a different religion or maybe a very different expression of Christian faith, whoever you are, wherever you're coming from, I think it's amazing that we found a way to get together and think about something that we're told supposedly everybody's supposed to fight about and just be mad about all the time. But we didn't, we just hung out together and talked about things that are transcendent and meaningful. And hopefully we did all of that with the underlying assumption that you can just dismiss anything you want to about my opinions or what I'm saying. I mean, come on, it's podcasts. You can do whatever you want. And maybe just ratcheting down that pressure a little bit makes it that much easier for us to think about deep water stuff with people who aren't just exactly like us in every single way. And I am very hungry for that at this point in the unfolding of history and culture and our civilization. So whoever you are, wherever you're coming from, thank you for doing this. I wouldn't want it any other way. The big picture, maybe final word here on this whole, what do we do with the Bible thing and what did we just read? I've been thinking about it like this. It seems like the Bible covers four eras, maybe five, and it leaves a question mark about one more that even though I don't have an answer for it, I want to ask on the way out the doors. We wrap up this series here. The first era. Yeah, yeah, I'm going to divide it up like this. The first era is before time. This is before existence as we know existence. And we get a little glimpse into that world where there is God pure being essence. I am. And God decides that instead of there not being things, there are going to be things. And that gets us into this second era, which is the bulk of the Old Testament. God makes stuff and sin and failure and destruction and injustice and wrongness and entropy and the second law of thermodynamics breaking down everything that is destructive gets introduced into that beautiful thing that God built. And then God rather than deciding that he was going to wash his hands of it, start over, he decides he's going to redeem it. So we learned something about God in this second part. And that is that if he's unlimited and he's powerful enough to make everything, he's powerful enough to know how it was going to go. And it was within his purposes and designs that he would make something that of its own volition would go off the rails and that then of his own volition, he would redeem because all I can assume is that redeeming must bring him some kind of great pleasure. And redeeming points to his glory and godness. And so he sets out on this redemptive plan. But in the Old Testament, what we see are a whole bunch of attempts, different things that naturally anybody reading the text or philosophizing about life in the world in this context would consider as a solution. Like, well, OK, God, well, let's try this. Why don't you have the people do that? What do you give them a leader like this then? Oh, that didn't work. Well, let's give them a different setup. Let's have like a council of leaders who know that didn't work either. Well, let's have them like have wars and stuff. So they'll appreciate what they have more. No, that didn't work either. Now, let's have this religious sacrifice. I mean, you see what I'm driving at through the whole Old Testament as we've discussed so many times, we see a whole bunch of attempts at making things right and solving the problem that are very human centric that involve people really getting their act together and finally through leaning into better character and better judgment and listening to the words of God through the prophets and having better institutions. We solve the human problem. We get things right. And it just keeps not working. And the whole Old Testament just reads like this cycle of failures. But every time we go through one of those cycles of failure in the Old Testament and yes, if you can hear it, I'm making that cycle gesture with my left hand as I talk. Every time we go through one of those cycles, there's also this glimmer of hope, this reminder that's built in like, hey, there is a paradigm that will work and it is coming and it is going to happen. And as you go through the Old Testament, that paradigm becomes more and more clear. And then we get into the next era, which I think is a very short era of the Bible. That's the era where Jesus himself is physically in the world. And Jesus repeatedly talked about this little era as being very unique and very special. But this is the part where the paradigm change happens. This is the new deal, the new covenant. This is where the heavy lift shifts from, well, here are all the different ways we could have humans try to really work this thing out to. OK, can we just all admit that humans cannot solve this catastrophe, that this is a calamity that we cannot put back together? We can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. God is going to have to do all the lift on this in order for it to work. And so God shows up, puts on flesh, lives this perfect life, teaches this stuff, goes to the cross, dies and is resurrected. And that little window, that's the ticket. That's the, that's the pivot moment for the whole thing. But Jesus himself said during that time that there would be a variety of responses to this culminating moment in the redemptive plan. And then we get the fourth era of the Bible. And I think that's the one we're in right now. It's the one that I guess you could call the age of the church. And it looks like in the New Testament, even a lot of people were like, great. OK, well, everything is solved and we're done here. Jesus won. And so I guess now is the time for the reckoning and to judge all the nations and to sort out all the evil and bad things that have ever happened. And now there can be heaven and the kingdom. So let's just do it. Let's just end history. But that isn't what happened. Jesus made it clear like, you don't really need to worry about that. We'll get to that. In the meantime, go tell other people about this thing and let there be a tangible representation of my kingdom in the world. And even though people wanted there to be a timeline, there has not been a timeline. And we're still in this era right now. The downside of this is that you have to continue to endure evil and injustice and all of the failures of the kingdoms of this world. But the upside to this very long extended church era is the you and I exist. Probably like a hundred years ago, everybody was like, man, we need to wrap this thing up. It is time for the end of the church era. That was nice, but it's time for God to just close it out, let there be a reckoning, redeem all things. And if they got their wish, you and I simply never would have existed to even be aware of this story ever. So if anybody wished for that a hundred years ago, I'm glad they didn't get what they wanted and that God saw fit to extend this age of the church for, I assume, the greater purposes of his glory. When he ultimately brings about that day of the Lord and judges the stuff that is wrong and also demonstrates his grace and the full manifestation of this kingdom we've been reading about in the Bible to those who are in Christ. It's kind of exciting. Finally, the Bible describes an era that is not yet happened, but that will happen in the future. And this day of the Lord idea where there's a reckoning and God does judge all of the accumulated evil and injustice and cruelty and awfulness that it looked like was just going to go. Untouched, but God did not forget and he will bring about justice for that. And also he will bring about forgiveness and pardon for those who were in him and then the kingdom is realized and established. And it looks like the story, the arc as it is described to us wraps up with God living in communion with his people, with his family of faith that he has built. And he's glorified in that and that's where the story wraps up. So I think that's a pretty awesome front to end. Look at what's going on here. It's cohesive. It hangs together, but it does leave one more question that I don't know the answer to. And that is what happens after that. What's the next project? What's the next thing that God wants to explain about himself or demonstrate to all of existence and what role do people who are a part of that kingdom get to play? I think it's kind of fun and interesting and awe inspiring to speculate about that undiscovered country, that next thing that happens and what that looks like. And I think I'm content to just let that be a question that hangs out there for you and me moving forward. I know I've said it about a hundred times. Let's say it one more. Thanks for doing this with me. It was a very meaningful exercise and my life will not be the same ever. This was truly transformative for me and I'm grateful as we wrap up this series right now. We are officially two days away as I'm recording this from starting the next one on the Book of Esther. I've told you about that over the last few days set in Persia. There's all kinds of history and super interesting, colorful characters. And it's the only book of the Bible that doesn't mention God. What gives? What's the deal with that? We're going to tear into all of that stuff with a pretty solid deep dive into Persian history on the front end of it. Starting on Monday and I'd be super grateful if you'd be apart and maybe even bring along a friend. Finally, I got to say thank you to the people who support the program. There's a bunch of different ways to do it. I don't need to get into all of that. But you can find out about if you want to at thetmbh.com slash support. The simple way to put it is this podcast only exists because some of you do that. And I know I've had my wife saying thanks a whole bunch at the end of every episode, but really truly. It means a world that you would invest in this thing and make it happen. And also, I suppose that you would invest in my family in that way as well. So thank you to everybody who's done that at any point in any way along the way. It just means a ton. All right, my friends. Season three of the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast on the Book of Esther starts on Monday and I can't wait. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon."}]
