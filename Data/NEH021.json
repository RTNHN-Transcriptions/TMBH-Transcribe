Because I don't want anybody to feel criticized, but I do feel strongly about it. So I'm just going to do my best. And I don't know, I like everybody. I don't want to be mean. It's just this is what I feel. And this is how the things are. I visited my alma mater a few months back here, Trinity College for a while there was called Trinity International University. It's on the north shore of Chicago in the suburbs. It's really a beautiful campus. Obviously I went there as a young man. I was 18 years old. I didn't know anybody when I walked onto that campus. I was born cool. I made a bunch of lifelong friends. I met my wife on my first day of school in my very first class. That philosophy professor in that class not only taught me how to think, but he also bummed a ride out to Nebraska where we got married and read Robert Burns poetry at our wedding while I wore a kilten bagpipes plate. It was just rad. It was one of the coolest things ever. So it was a great experience being there. And it wasn't the perfect immaculate campus, but it was lovely. It was clean. It was nice, a bunch of trees and everything. You were right in the middle of Chicago bowls, Chicago Bears land. It was just a neat experience. And for the most part, I would say I really enjoyed it. Well, as I was saying, I went back there a few months ago because I'd heard that some pretty big changes were happening. Well, it turns out the big changes are that they're closing it. It's just not going to be a campus anymore. I don't know if they've come up with a deal to sell it or what. I'm sure that land is worth a crazy amount of money. It's gone. It's shutting it down. And that's it. They're going to do some online classes or something. I don't know. I'm a little sore about it. And so I just went to the campus to look around and see, is it true? What does it look like there? And it was wild, my friends. This place that is so alive with memories for me was overgrown with weeds. There's a baseball field that I help make because I was a scholarship baseball player and body and we're doing the baseball program thing. So we did all this work to maintain the field and improve things and it's gone. It's just wrecked. It's overgrown. It looks like a zombie movie or I am legend or something. There's trash, at least there was when I was there here a few months ago. Trash scattered all over the place and just nothing. It's completely hollowed out. It's crazy. And this is during the school year, mind you. And so it's probably the most jarring go back to a place I've cared about in the past experience of my entire life. The strangest, most disappointing homecoming. I filmed a whole bunch of it. I think I might make a video about it when I can figure out how to talk about it in a way that's fruitful. But it kind of hurts. It's a huge disappointment. But that really disappointing homecoming pales in comparison to Ezra's homecoming after he gets a whole bunch of money unloaded and sets up shop back in Jerusalem and begins to assess something to see what we did there. It's a formula that I'm starting to tinker with here on the program where I start out with an anecdote from a book or a movie or something from my own life or a story I heard about. And then I'm like, it's like this. And we all sort of feel some of the emotions together. But then I'm like, but speaking of that feeling, it's similar to the thing in the Bible. I don't know. I don't know if it's going to stick. I don't know if that's exactly how I want to do things moving forward. But like I said, I'm tinkering with it. So likewise, this Ezra fellow has a very similar experience, except it's worse. He goes back to Jerusalem in chapter eight and we talked for the last few days about all of the adventures that happened on that trip. And Ezra's, at least from the outside looking in, lack of a plan for how to move a quarter of a billion dollars across bandit infested territory to Jerusalem without getting robbed and without any kind of regal military escort. And yet somehow it works out. Ezra leans really hard, not into some emotion or hunch or prophetic vision or the message in a dream that he receives. Like all those things that other characters in the Bible receive when they do things that seem kind of weird or unadvisable under other circumstances. Now he doesn't have any of that. Ezra instead does something really interesting. He looks at the big picture of history, the crazy big picture. He's like, all right. So the prophet said this, this happened, then this happened. And right on time, this other thing happened. And now the king's of Persia are treating us like this. Yeah, I just, I think where it's going to work. I think this is part of the story. I think we have the momentum of the story behind us and God is behind the story. It's going to work out. And I recorded that last week. I've been thinking about that all weekend. It's just wild. What a gutsy call on Ezra's part to be that sure that he was reading the big picture unfolding of history, not in the distant past, mind you. But in real time, in the moment, he was that sure he was reading it right that he chose to play it that way. And then he's vindicated. He makes a trip. He has no business making without getting robbed. I don't think I have enough confidence in my understanding of the flow of history or clarity on what's actually going on in the moment to read things the way he did, but whatever. They get there and everybody, it turns out, was honest and they all dump out their money. They spread it out amongst all but different guys. They all get there. Nobody took any of it. Nobody stole anything and everything's accounted for. I mean, that's a miracle in and of itself as we discussed. And then in verse 36, last verse of Ezra 8, it says, they also delivered the king's orders to the royal sat traps and to the governors of trans-Eufrates. That in itself is a huge deal. I mean, Ezra is hanging out with wildly important people. The satrap is, I mean, that's the second tier, most powerful human on earth. One of the 28 most powerful people on earth, the most powerful being the king. And after that tied for a second or the 27 satraps, it's insane that Ezra is dropping off orders from the king. All casual like to this guy and then the sub governors of trans-Eufrates. And then it says that all of these people who represent the power of Persia, the greatest power on earth at this time, it says they then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God. So what they did with the infrastructure to do is just, it's an amazing chapter, chapter 8. So then chapter nine, you're like, all right, well, it's homecoming time. All of the logistics are handled. This is great. The money got there. Everybody's happy. We're all having a nice time. Let's see how things are going in Jerusalem. Because remember, I mean, you remember what Ezra's doing right here. He is going up to rebuild, not the temple. That's already been rebuilt by the generation of leaders earlier as a rubable in his pals. Now he's going up to rebuild the people specifically having been instructed to do so by artisans. He's the king of kings, he a king and a king at the time. So he knows the job, go rebuild the people. Let's see what's now works out after these things had been done. The leaders came to me and said, the people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples, whether to testable practices like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, parasites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. I was like, it's weird that the Amorites are bad because it's like a moor. You'd think they'd be like people who love people in the same way that obviously since Philadelphia means the city of brotherly love, you get the most tender-hearted, kind, easy on the refs, easy on disappointing athletes, easy on opposing fan bases, kind of fans ever because the name means brotherly love. Amorites. These be awesome people, but apparently they did the testable practices. So Ezra comes back and the news is terrible right out of the gate. His alma mater is covered in weeds and everything's taken apart and there's trash and everything just looks awful except way worse because Ezra is a student of history. Remember, he's confident enough in his read on the big picture of the history of the relationship between the Jewish people and God and the prophets and everything in the Bible, all of that stuff. He's so sure he's reading it right that he just wagered his life. The lives of all the people he cares about and a quarter of a billion dollars on that certainty that he's reading things right. So he's got a real strong sense of what went wrong and how the Jews found themselves in exile in the first place. And I'm not just making this up. It gets spelled out here over the course of the next chapter or so, but his real strong sense is we intermarried with all of the other neighboring people and instead of getting them to adopt our practices, which I still don't think God would have wanted us to do, but that would have at least been better. Instead, we adopted all of theirs. They do horrible things. There are people on this list who took their living babies and seriously, like I'm giving you this is a content warning. I'm straight up giving you a content warning to plug in years or turn it off for kids or whatever because I mean, I already said the baby's part. So you know, it's going to be bad. Four, three, two, one, and they took a statue, a metal statue, a bronze statue to their God, Molek, and they would take these babies and they would heat up the statue from the inside and the outside so that the hands were roasting and they would sacrifice infants to this fake God in a way that was the most excruciating possible to a baby. Should we be mad at Ezra for choosing this language here, calling their practices detestable? Or is it okay to call that detestable? I guess I tipped my hand a little bit. I think it's okay to call it detestable. Ezra sees the exact same mistakes of the past being repeated, but it's not quite the same in Ezra's eyes because in the past, they'd only been told what the consequences would be. They'd only seen samples of it, but maybe deep down there were like, yeah, but it's not like we're going to get our temple torn down all the way into slavery and exile and have our entire people relocated and be stripped of our identity and our land. That's probably never going to happen. But now, I'm sure as Roan says, hey to these guys, what excuse do you have? You know what will happen? You know that if such an extreme, awful punishment and judgment from the one true God will happen if we do these kinds of things, then you should also be able to reason to the other half of that covenant that God made with Moses that great blessings, equally amazing blessings in the other direction could be waiting for our people group. And indeed, we've already tasted a few of them with God moving the heart of the Persian kings. If we do what we're supposed to do, how can you possibly get this wrong so quickly? Now, if you've read the rest of the Old Testament, you know, it's, I mean, how can you possibly get it wrong? Because the same disease that lives in the people back then who are in view here lives in you and me today. That's the biblical take on how sin works. It's just, I mean, look, you don't have to accept it. I know that there are a lot of you who would say, yeah, I don't know what to make of that part of what the Bible teaches about sin. I, you know, probably many of you would say that sin is more ignorance and it's not something that anybody really bears culpability from. It's just human weakness or frailty, but that really isn't what the Bible teaches. The Bible describes sin as being something that is done to us that is flicked upon us and something that we choose for ourselves and left to our own ends would just keep choosing for ourselves. It's a disease, but it's a disease that we make and proliferate as well. It is the problem sin and the consequences of sin are the problem that is laid out back here at the beginning of the Bible that this whole story that we've been looking at, it's all about how God is resolving that problem. And ultimately Jesus turns out to be the solution for all of that. And we talked about that a whole bunch in Matthew. The report continues here from the people who were bringing Ezra up to speed. They've taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them and the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness. And then it's a, Hizrah says about himself when I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. Anytime we start talking about anything from any point in history that has words like mingled and holy race and things like that, whoo, we are getting right into very understandable trigger words and trigger concepts and we're not going to duck it. We're going to get into all of that and what to do with it next time around. Probably a little tougher homecoming for Ezra than he anticipated. The metaphorical alma mater is probably in a worse state of disrepair than he anticipated. Probably he anticipated something would be going wrong, but probably he couldn't have imagined that they'd be making these exact same mistakes again, but I mean, come on, he always knew this was a reclamation project and so did we in the coming conversations. We'll see what he's going to do about it. All right, I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
