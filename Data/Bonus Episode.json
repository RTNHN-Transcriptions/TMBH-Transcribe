Now you've heard the bonus episode song Just so everybody's on the same page Bonus episodes are ones that we do on the weekend We just put up whenever they don't quite fit format-wise Into what we do with our regular episodes But I got some stuff that I want to cover and it's got to go somewhere So it's going here I don't really hold myself to a tight time limit on bonus episodes Which I find refreshing because I get to take the foot off the gas a little bit And not worry about getting just everything I can in within a pretty tight time frame What I want to talk about in this conversation is just a summary A big overview of the basic details, broad strokes of everything we've covered so far Up to the end of second Chronicles Because we're almost to the end of the historical books And it's just so much And I don't want you to lose it because the point of this exercise is for you To quickly and succinctly level up your understanding of the Bible As one big coherent document But we're getting hit with a lot of information very quickly And so from time to time I want to pause and be like Alright, let's just solidify what we already have here So that we keep the levels up that we've earned But before we do that I would just like to talk about my experience for a moment Because there's no time for that in these episodes as we're cruising through We're not much anyway I am having so much fun And I am learning so very very much I don't know that I've ever read this much Bible This quickly And I cannot believe how much time I just put into Ezra and Nehemiah Those are very short books But I went through them a lot over and over and over again I was like, oh, well, how does this fit together? The timeline gets a little bit weird here How does this work? And maybe some of you know that the next book series we're going to do is on Esther When we're done with this, we're going to dive deep into the Book of Esther And Esther is set in Persia In the same way that Ezra and Nehemiah are set in Persia So I have done a ton of work Trying to remember stuff from school And also just really really dig into Persian history And trying to catch the nuance and the details and the little stuff Before we take a close look at Esther And so it made it really fun to go and read Ezra and Nehemiah For the first time since I've done all of this Persia work That I've been doing for basically the last year now in anticipation of Esther So this has just been incredibly meaningful for me I'm seeing nuance and color and shades That I've just never seen in the Bible before And I've never looked at Matthew as closely as we just got done looking at it together So I've also got that in the back of my head as we're going through the Old Testament I'm like, oh, everything rhymes Everything fits together It's like a hundred layers of completion and connection that I'd never thought about or known That I'm catching way more of this time around And that's exciting to me Because I thought I knew the Bible fairly well Before we started doing this And I'm like, whoa, dang, there's tons more than I thought Well, if I thought I knew it fairly well And I'm learning this much more on this trip through Then I should stay excited and frosty Because next time through, it means it's going to be even more stuff This is just truly a remarkable document That has the fingerprints of the maker of all things all over it I like reading, I like books I like literature from the ancient world I'm a history guy I mean, kind of for a job I'm a history guy is what I went to school for first and theology second And I've read gallons and gallons of stuff written in centuries Even millennia past and just nothing works like the Bible I hope this series is whatever it needs to be for wherever you're at in your process But man, I love the freedom that comes with the way we're able to approach this together I love the freedom that comes with announcing in advance Hey, the bottom line of the podcast is not to get you to sign up for exactly my church or version of Christianity I'm coming at this thing as tabular raza as possible And I know a bunch of you are doing the same thing And so it's cool that we just don't have that pressure between us To be like, hey, say exactly the right thing here Have the right opinion or worth through As I feel that grace and that freedom to explore And discover for myself and share it with you from you and it means a lot. So thanks But it is frustrating. I mean this Ezra Nehemiah thing that I just got done recording It's not out yet as you're hearing this particular episode, but I'm done with those two I just could have gone for weeks and weeks and weeks on the extra biblical history there And all the places where it overlaps like all these kings Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes and we just get passing mentioned to a hash or Sir Xerxes as he's known in Esther But all of these kings there's so much history There's so much recorded about them that we know what pressures they were under We can kind of triangulate what they must have been thinking. We know them so well that we know their personalities It's like we're just seeing the history all of a sudden as we get to Ezra and Nehemiah In so much more color and that is exhilarating for me And it's probably the maximum moment where I've felt the frustration of ah I wish we were doing like a 15 year series going through all the books of the bible in order But we're doing it this way It's going to pay big dividends as we go and explore other books of the bible And I'm having fun. And so thank you for indulging me and letting me talk about the process I've gone through here and how I am feeling about it now Let's talk about big picture of the story that we've been looking at the bible opens with nothing God makes existence out of non-existence and we get this scene in the garden Where humanity falls god decides he's going to redeem it then we get the primeval portion of genesis, right? Remember this the almost prehistory stuff that tells these big tales about how the the breaking of creation the damaging of The humanity of the people mating god's image how that's affecting everything and how people just cannot solve it themselves or get out of their own way Then the second half of genesis introduces us to A human character the scope is narrowed. We pinched zoom in on Abraham and then we follow his family We discover quickly his best thing is that he believes god, but he has a bunch of other character flaws His descendants have all kinds of character flaws, but it's not about them. God makes an unconditional promise to Abraham That there is going to be one who that serpent is going to strike at but ultimately All of the curse is going to be crushed by this one who is vaguely alluded to in genesis as being to come We learn more about that when god tells Abraham that there's going to be a blessing for all the nations that comes out of this Descendants and this great people he's going to make from Abraham and from there on out what we see are constant reminders That this redemptive plan is owned by god and only carried forward because Of the persistence and faithfulness And grace and long view of god and that it's carried out in spite of people including the people Who at least ostensibly claimed to serve god We're also going to see playing out all kinds of moments where it looks like there's just no way this plan can still work out It's broken. It's wrecked forget it. It's shot and then it keeps working out. It keeps it keeps Just sneaking out of the death star just as it explodes and okay the redemptive plan moves forward Oh no the redemptive plan is down to the last man But he finds a way to escape as the enemy closes in and gets to regroup and the redemptive plan moves forward Oh no the redemptive plan is at death's door sick and frail But at the last minute the redemptive plan pulls through and we see this Ebb and flow as we go through the Old Testament history books And see how it's almost like god is stacking the deck of history against himself To make it clear that this redemptive plan is his and his alone And that he is the only reason that it's being seen through In exodus all of Abraham's descendants who had found favor in egypt are forgotten the new pharaoh there Has just moved on and in a terrible reversal of fortune the israelites that I just called them jewish a minute ago That's a bit of anachronistic whatever the israelites are now slaves It looks like the redemptive plan is shot He just ended up an ancient near eastern people group forgotten who died as slaves in some foreign land, but nope God delivers the people using flawed leaders and gigantic miraculous signs That are assigned to all the people those who like israel and those who don't they all see well Their god looks like that that's the real god And they cross the red sea and they go out into the desert and god reveals himself And gives the law and starts to set up the ground rules Of what it's going to look like for there to be a relationship between a very flawed people group and an infinite flawless god I mean it makes sense it would take a minute to explain that that's a pretty strange union Well In the meantime the patience of the people runs out like we can't even wait to hear what the terms of this are We want to worship gods that are predictable like this here golden calf And still despite their immediate idolatry god still persists with them Lays out the law and physically guides his chosen people toward the promised land of Canaan But when they get there despite all they've seen they're like no, I don't want to do it And we're not we're not gonna go in doesn't feel like a good idea And so god's like okey dokey Well, then every last one of you from this generation is gonna die and then and only then will I take the next generation in And that's what happens so old man moses renews the covenant sitting outside the promised land Waiting for all of the generation from egypt to die off And with the covenant renewed and moses now dead joshua takes command and into the holy land we go and it is violent and bloody and Frightening at times But the conquest goes mostly well under the leadership of joshua from an israelite Redemptive plan perspective from the Canaanites who melted their babies to appease their gods It didn't go so well I think it was a very disappointing conquest from their perspective But not all of them some of the Canaanites were allowed to hang around and that theme is recurring through Judges and first and second samuel first and second kings because even as old man joshua now with the conquest mostly done effectively renews the covenant again and then dies The israelites just can't help themselves And they want to be like their neighbors. They want their god to be more like the petty Canaanite gods They even offer their own children as sacrifices in some of the most extreme circumstances In the style of what the Canaanites did for their god And so then we get the several hundred year era of the judges where everybody does whatever they see fit in Their own eyes. There is no king The judges aren't even really particularly impressive And even though they're very flawed god still uses the massively flawed people who he has at his disposal But almost none of the judges Provide us with any indication that they understood the character of god and it's a horrible deeply dark time Where the redemptive plan looks like it's gone off the rails god has redeemed this people He led them out of slavery led them through the desert He even continued with the redemptive plan after they effectively rejected his leadership out there in the wilderness And now you've got a land and you've got the land divided up and You've got god as your king But it's not good enough for them and they embrace the Canaanite practices and reject the ways of god reject the law of god And judges is an absolute dumpster fire with almost no glimmers of hope Except for the little aside that we get during the era of the judges with the story of Ruth and boas And their descendants obed jesse and then david The split book of samuel takes us through the story of one who's effectively the last of the judges samuel and his sons and Into the air of the kings and the people want a king in part because of the failure of samuel's sons They're in justice. It's just a continuation of the The cycles of the judges and they're like, let's just break the cycle Let's do a king like everybody else has and samuel's like not such a good idea and they're like cool We want one anyway And so god gives them a king no longer in a practical sense Will god be their monarch but some dude is going to be and those some dudes do everything samuel warned them They would do is kings and more and we're only able to retain relative Disability for a couple of generations of this monarchy saw starts great spirals into ruin David who when god rejects saw his king and has david anointed to be the next king David starts out pretty strong Speed wobbles really hard in the middle gets some stuff right later on and then has a mixed conclusion Handing off instructions to his son salomon on his deathbed Well in the midst of all of that though god makes another promise that is unconditional to david There's going to be this great line of kings and there's going to be a great king who will sit on the throne and will reign forever And it's unconditional david is going to be an idiot But god is going to see the redemptive plan through the line of david one way or another But that gets hard to picture after david dies and his son starts off strong But then falls into the same trap of looking too much like his kina knight pegan neighbors And doesn't end so hot but what salomon does achieve is he builds a grand temple to the lord and god shows up It's physically evident that god miraculously showed up and dwelt in the temple amongst his chosen people but the monarchy does not survive salomon's descendants and civil war breaks out and Ten of the tribes run off to the north to say yeah, we're gonna do our own thing We're gonna have our own kingdom up here. That is an unmitigated disaster from beginning to end And what turns out to be described as only two tribes remain in the south juda and benjamin and there we at least see some good kings it's more hit and miss there and And even the good kings make a lot of mistakes and in first and second kings those mistakes of the southern kings are more heavily emphasized where in first and second chronicles the Successes the changes of heart after a mistake here. There are more heavily emphasized amongst those Kings of the south god sends prophets like elijah and elisha who interact with the kings of the north and the south and Particularly in a lot of the rebukes are directed at the north and after elijah and elisha There's a whole lot of other I guess what we call more minor prophets who come along and speak to one atrocity or one particular king or one particular Moment of error in the history of the people of israel or even juda But ultimately all of that prophesying toward the northern kingdom is for not They do not listen over the long haul and the dreaded Assyrians come in and Conquered the northern kingdom and set it to ruin entirely in 722 BC now. They're just gone that happens in kings All that's left now is the southern kingdom and they actually hold out for quite a while longer another 140 years until they get crossways at the empire who defeated the Assyrians these being the babylonians And the babylonians show up and they are not messing around they destroy Jerusalem They destroy the temple brick from brick. They wreck it completely. They leave only a few poor people behind to tend the land Reduce juda to a nothing backwater and take pretty much everybody away toward modern day Iraq Baghdad Babylon Into captivity and it's there that we get the stories of king nebiconesor and shadrach michak and abednego that we haven't covered yet and Daniel that we haven't covered yet, but the babylonians aren't in charge for very long they get their judgment day in 539 BC when Cyrus the great of Persia shows up and deposes the last king of the babylonians and abonitis And the Persians they take a totally different approach. They're like all right Um, we're not gonna go with the iron fist. We're gonna go with more like a smoothly carved wooden fist it's still a fist and it would still hurt But we want you to like us so the brand new king of the world Cyrus the great issues of decree at the end of second chronicles that says all right you exiles Go on back up with the blessing of the king the resources even of the king of Persia To rebuild your capital city to rebuild your temple And so as you can see several times through there it looks like god's chosen people blew it so badly That maybe there's just no way for this thing to work out But all those glimmers of hope keep paying off God preserves the redemptive plan. God preserves his people through whom he promised unconditionally to bless all the nations And now as we get to the end of second chronicles We can see more than a glimmer of hope we can see a straight-up pathway for how this might get back on track And in Ezra and Nehemiah, we're gonna see how that actually plays out and what goes in To the process of unrecating something beautiful that had been wrecked and getting this thing back on track Hopefully that's helpful for you. It's helpful for me to just sit down at the microphone and get it all out there Then and run through the whole list of things and the story is one cohesive unit I cannot stress enough how much fun i'm having and how grateful i am to you for making it go I've also seen that a bunch of you have done a couple of things a bunch of you have gone and written reviews of late on various podcasting apps That is the most helpful thing ever Short of straight up inviting a friend who you know in the real world That's the most helpful thing for getting this in front of other people those ratings and reviews are huge and they're fun to read and they're kind I've read every word of those.
