I think we've talked about that before. It was pretty much a great experience. I had a wonderful childhood. My parents were great parents. Still are great parents. I'm saying all this because you hear people say that my pastor's kids are all turds and I don't think we were super turds. I think we were normal, like sort of turdish, but also like kind of normal and kind of good kids. I don't know. And I mean growing up in a church was pretty cool as a community. People treated us well. There were ups and downs to all of that. I mean, generally speaking, pretty good experience being a pastor's kid. And if eventually I had to go through a bit of a process of making this thing my own. And even if maybe I'm still kind of going through that process. Now, I don't have any gripes about my upbringing. My parents were wonderful. They are wonderful. Okay. All that said, every now and then dad would give a sermon and maybe there was a little more pressure at that point in his career, whereas kind of an expectation like, Hey, get us out of here on time. You're on thin ice here, buddy, because that I mean, that happens in churches. It's like anywhere else you answer to people. Sometimes they're real happy with you. They're maybe not quite as happy with you. And maybe at times my dad, looking back on it, felt a little pressure to really try to get everything done by the done time on a Sunday morning. And I remember a few sermons where he would be developing a really complex thing. Big ideas, sweeping overview of this whole thread that runs through the whole Bible. Dad was very, very good. And my dad is brilliant. He's just a Bible genius. He's phenomenally gifted, excellent communicator. He'd go big. He would develop these big ideas and his sermons. And I can remember a few where he would get into the big idea and we're not even into the meat of the immediate text. And he would look at his watch and be like, Oh, no, I've probably got half an hour to go on this thing. I wrote too much. I did too much. I got too ambitious. I'm in trouble. And he would just fly through the rest of the sermon like, Okay. And then this happened, then this happened, this happened. This is why it's important. It's probably what you ought to think about. We're going to skip the closing hymn. The Lord bless you and keep you in kind of like a gesture or something. All right, take care. And it would end really, really fast. And it always seemed pretty comical to me as a kid. But those sermons definitely stand out. We're dabbled to go into fast forward mode, realizing that with his social calculus that he was running on the fly that he was just out of time. And that's all he was going to get to do with that one. Again, looking back on it, I think it was all a pretty good experience. What I'm really trying to drive at is I think you get a sermon like that. And X chapter seven, where the guy who's given it had a lot that he wanted to say. There's a big theme that he wanted to develop. But before he could get all the way through the whole theme, which would basically cover the whole Old Testament, kind of like Nehemiah chapter nine does. Before he could do that, he figured out, Oh, I'm on thin ice and not thin ice like, all right, Buster, this is taking a little too long and we got a roast on at home. Get it over with. Okay, pal, that's a nice sermon or whatever. But the Broncos play at 12.05 from the sermons taken to I got to go right now. No, it was more like we hate everything you're saying so much that we're going to hit you in the face with rocks until you die starting like right now. And so then as they go to get rocks and stuff, the guy giving the sermon and X chapter seven had to be like, okay, I'm going to get some skip a whole bunch of stuff. The point is this. And then he nails the point and then they, I guess I'm sound kind of flipping about it. Spent a couple thousand years. Maybe it's not too soon, but then they do like they go ahead and kill him. He's the first Christian martyr that we read about in the Bible. So all of that said, what we're getting in X chapter seven is a sermon of this guy, Steven. He's an early Christian and it is a parallel passage with Nehemiah chapter nine, the sort of flips Nehemiah chapter nine on its head. You get the impression that the people that Steven is talking to, the descendants of Abraham the religious leaders of the day, we're looking back to that revival that you and I have been talking about in the fall of 444 BC in Jerusalem under the Persian, achaemenid kings and they're feeling like that's what we point to. That's where we got our crap together. That's where we quit doing stupid stuff. But then along comes Jesus and they reject him and have him put to death. And then Jesus comes back to life in a sense of the right hand of the father and a bunch of people start to follow Jesus and the religious leaders start to get really upset. And they start wanting to kill more people. And along comes this guy, Steven, who's like, Hey, you're looking back to this stuff from Nehemiah chapter nine, like that's where you are. And like this revival is still holding, but the positive effects of that revival have not been comprehensive. It hasn't worked out. You have become the bad guys who your ancestors in Nehemiah nine were denouncing or apologizing for being back then. We're making the mistakes that the wrong people in Nehemiah nine were making. I'm not going to read you all of it, but we'll cover a pretty good chunk. Here we go. Acts seven one, then the high priest asked him asked Steven, or are these charges true to this he, Steven replied, brothers and fathers, listen to me, the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia before he lived in Huron. And surely immediately everybody in the room, because he's talking to the religious leaders here. And he's like, Oh, okay, get comfortable. We're going to answer this question by going all the way back to Abraham. Are these charges true? Well, let's talk about Abraham from the Old Testament and everything that happened after that. So okay, get comfy. So God said, Abraham, leave your country and your people. God said, and go to the land I will show you. So we left the land of the Cal deans and he settled in Huron after the death of his father. God sent him to this land where you all are now living. He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground, but God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. God spoke to him in this way, your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and they will be enslaved and mistreated 400 years, but I will punish the nation they serve as slaves. God said, and afterward they'll come out of that country and worship me in this place. Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision and Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob and Jacob became the father of the 12 patriarchs because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph. They sold him as a slave into Egypt, but God was with them and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So he made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace, but then a famine struck all Egypt and Cain and bringing great suffering and our fathers couldn't find food. When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit. On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was and Stephen goes on with this bit all the way to the end of Genesis. The angels right in the Exodus introduces us to Moses and talks about how he was no ordinary child. Then for three months, Moses was cared for in his father's house, when he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him. Okay. Yeah, all that's in Exodus as well. When Moses was 40 years old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites were 24 verses in at this point. Everybody is settled in, but maybe getting a little agitated after 40 years had passed. An angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush. Okay. So now we're into that part of the story and we skip ahead a little further and Stephen says he led them out of Egypt and he did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt at the Red Sea and for 40 years in the desert. This is that Moses who told the Israelites, God will send you a prophet like me from your own people. So Stephen is pointing out that Moses was pointing to Jesus. Moses anticipated that Jesus was coming and everybody should be looking for him. He was in the assembly in the desert when the angel spoke with him on Mount Sinai and with our fathers and he received living words to pass on to us, but our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. They told Aaron, make us God, who will go before us? This is for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt. We don't know what's happened to him. That was the time they made the idol in the form of the calf. They brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honor of what their hand said made, but God turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets. Quote, did you bring me sacrifices and offerings 40 years in the desert, O house of Israel? You've lifted up the shrine of Molech and the star of your God, Raphon, the idols you made to worship. Therefore, I'll send you into exile beyond Babylon. Now based on the way the rest of this plays out, at this point, I sense that Stephen was detecting the agitation in the room and knew that he was going to have to wrap things up and really drive home the point he was going to drive home before what was about to happen to him was about to happen to him. So he says, our forefathers had the tabernacle of the testimony with them in the desert. It had been made as God directed Moses according to the pattern he had seen. Having received the tabernacle, our fathers under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David who enjoyed God's favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob, but it was Solomon who built the house for him. So we're covering just hundreds of years at a time here. Massive swaths. We just flew through the book of Judges. However, verse 48, the most high does not live in houses made by men, as the prophet says. Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord? Or where will be my resting place? Has not my hand made all these things? And then you can tell that the walls are closing in. They can see what Stephen is driving at. We don't have time to unpack all of that here. I made a couple of YouTube videos on this years ago when I covered the book of Acts. I'll have Jeff linked that down below if you want to dig into Acts seven more. But Stephen can clearly tell the temperatures rising. They're picking up what he's putting down. They can tell where this is headed. He's going to point the finger right at them and say, you're on the side of all the people who got it wrong and rejected God's work and rejected the prophets in the Old Testament and that's indeed what he does and how he wraps up this fast forward toward the end sermon that he's giving. Verse 51, this is Stephen, one dude alone talking to a group of people. He knows are angry enough to murder him at this point. They just killed the Jesus. He is verbally defending and being charged with following only a matter of days earlier. He knows what's coming yet. He musters the courage to face them all down and say this. Verse 51, you stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears. You are just like your fathers. You always resist the Holy Spirit. Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the righteous one and now you have betrayed and murdered him. You who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it. They did this. They were furious and gnashed to their teeth at him. But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. Look, he said, I see heaven opening in the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God. At this they covered their ears and yelling at the top of their voices. They all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul and that young man named Saul is the guy who would go on to write the book of the Bible that you and I are going to look at in the next season, that being the book of Galatians. Stephen draws on two things in that pivotal paragraph of righteous accusation that he levels against the religious leaders here. One he draws from the things Jesus of Nazareth said to these exact same men just a short time earlier in Matthew chapter 23, giving his own sort of Nehemiah 9 overview that concludes with a condemnation of how the religious leaders are behaving today. And two, Stephen is trying straight from the language of Nehemiah chapter 9, flipping it around on the very people who would point to that as the turning point or maybe even the birthing point of the intellectual religious leadership tradition that they are a part of. Remember in Nehemiah 9, the descendants of Abraham all prayed together, you warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They're talking about their own forefathers. They sinned against your ordinances by which a man will live if he obeys them stubbornly. They turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. Stephen's flipping that language right back around on them as well and they won't hear it and they respond violently. This is an intense passage and obviously it's sort of hard to maintain the playful tone that we often go with in this podcast when something so significant is happening both verbally and in terms of violent action. But hey, it is what it is. Finally, check your podcast apps because there's going to be an extra episode this week. We've got a bonus episode. There's going to be the song and everything. Jeff took that little bit of music that you hear at the front end of this whole season that he made for Nehemiah and made something really cool with it that we are going to send out to everybody who supports the program at any level on any platform. But you'll all be able to hear it on the podcast tomorrow, so make sure to check that out. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. All right, that's it for now. I'm Matt.
