When I was a kid, my parents would do the bedtime story thing, and some of the bedtime stories were like Chronicles of Narnia and other kid books. I remember books of poetry and fairy tales and stuff like that, but we would also do stuff from the Bible pretty much every night. And that went in phases from a really kiddish version of the Bible with a bunch of pictures to the boring, grown-up version of the Bible where the only pictures are in the maps at the end. But I remember one of those kid editions when I was maybe kindergarten, pre-kindergarten, there is this one account of this one miracle where they had this guy and they portrayed the dude with his arm just wrecked. I mean it was shot, it was withered down into this tiny little thing and it was twisted around and like kind of grotesque. At least at that age it was a pretty scary image because it looked so deformed and foreign. And then dad read through the story and of course the guy's hand gets healed by Jesus and in the next picture it's better. And I remember doing the jaw on the floor thing and making dad stop reading and I was like, how did everybody not believe in Jesus after that dad? And dad tried to be theological and pastorally because that wasn't as silly as his job. And he had no answer that could convince my five-year-old self that people could possibly see that happen and not believe. And as a result, this is maybe the miracle that has captured my imagination more than any other when I look at the Bible. This is an amazing break the laws of time and space right in front of your eyes kind of miracle. And in my fifth grade brain the equation was very simple. If a person saw that happen they would need to believe whatever the person who did it said because that person knows something the rest of us don't know. What did not stand out to me or stick with me as a kid reading that picture Bible with my dad is that the real controversy here wasn't about whether or not the guy's arm got healed. The text treats that like it's not in dispute at all. And like I guess if you wanted to go ask the people who were there you go ask about the guy's hand was wrecked and then it just came back to life in one instant. No, the real point of the passage like the passage we just got done looking at over the last week is the Sabbath controversy the ratcheting tension between Jesus and the Pharisees. But before we go back and spend more time on the whole Sabbath thing I'm going to give us a little Sabbath from the Sabbath because we've been talking about that a lot. I just want to deal with the miracle that is described in the following passage. Behold Matthew 12 starting in verse 9 going on from that place he Jesus went into the synagogue and a man with a shriveled hand was there looking for a reason to accuse Jesus they asked him as a lawful to heal on the Sabbath he said to them if any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath we not take hold of it and lift it out how much more valuable is a man than a sheep therefore it's lawful to do good on the Sabbath then he said to the man stretch out your hand so he stretched it out and it was completely restored just as sound as the other but the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus by now you know the rhythm of this thing it's going to take a few days to process through all of that let's just get the nuts and bolts of the narrative down right now so going on from that place ah ha there's another one of those Matthew chronological hint phrases that indicates that we are moving in direct chronological succession from what happened before so chapter 12 opens with a chronological break from chapter 11 you remember chapter 11 and with that stuff about all come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest and then chapter 12 opens with at that time Jesus went through the grain fields meaning that okay what you're about to see should be interpreted thematically in light of what you just read but it isn't necessarily chronologically immediate but then the jump from that anecdote where they're out in the fields and they're rubbing together grain in their hands and yes I literally make the rub together grain in my hands gesture every single time I talk about it even though this is an entirely audio medium so we get past that scene that we spent the last week on and then we get going on from that place he went into their synagogue so very chronologically necessarily next thing Jesus goes from the grain fields presumably outside of Capernaum into the synagogue in Capernaum I've ended that synagogue it's kind of fun whenever stuff in the Bible happens in places where I've hung around for extended periods of time the version of the synagogue that you see when you go there now is a couple remodels after the version of the synagogue that Jesus was in but it's in the same place as not going anywhere the pictures are probably on the wall of all of the grand pupas of the synagogue at Capernaum it's the same building it's the same tradition it's pretty cool to think that hey I've been in the place where a miracle that broke the laws of time and space like this is purported to have happened so he's in the synagogue and what happens in the synagogue this is almost like a temple embassy that each town that's lucky enough to have a synagogue would have as like a microcosm a mini representation of the larger conversation about the law that's been going on to the whole second temple period at the temple in Jerusalem the synagogue is a tradition that picked up steam by necessity during the exile in Persia and Babylon and again became a diasporadic micro expression of the larger conversation going on at the temple so he's now in the place that is the local representation of the thing he just chronologically got done saying that he is greater than remember in the previous passage Jesus said that he's greater than David he's greater than the temple and he's greater than the Sabbath so here he is on the Sabbath day that he just got done claiming to be greater than in an extension of the temple that he just got done claiming to be greater than and we is going to have an issue and a man with his shriveled hand was there it's almost like bait like hey shriveled hand guy could you just stand right over there in that shadowy spot huh what yeah sure no a little bit that way on that X cool bring Jesus in hey Jesus how you doing we're just here at the synagogue where we work oh what's that over there on that X that guy looks like he could sure use a healing what are you going to do Jesus looking for a reason to accuse Jesus they asked him is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath and then he says to them the stuff about the sheep falling into the pit and we're going to talk more about this little intellectual tetotet the bit of idea ball that they're playing right here because of the miracle get to the miracle then verse 13 he said to the man stretch out your hand so he stretched it out and it was completely restored just as sound as the other so this follows a really similar pattern to chapter it's nine right it's got to be nine yeah the beginning of chapter nine so Jesus gets back over toward Capernaum and remember some people brought in that paralytic Jesus is teaching and it's like oh here we go again there's the bait what's Jesus going to do and he's like hey take heart son your sins are forgiven what there's another thing you can't do you can't do that this blasphemy and Jesus is like okay first I'm going to respond to your dumb remarks and then to illustrate this theological truth through the breaking of the laws of time and space miraculously I'm going to go ahead and heal this guy and then that passage in Matthew chapter nine Jesus famously uses the formula you remember it he says but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins then he said to the paralytic get up take your mat and go home and the guy gets up and he's healed and then we're like what that's amazing how does that even happen and again it's one of those break the laws of time and space what are you going to do with that kind of miracles because that just happened in front of your face same thing Jesus responds to their stuff which we'll get to later and then he's like alright well let's do this thing he's making a theological point it isn't just a random oh I really you know care about all the people but most of all I care about you shriveled hand guy so I guess you get your hand back everybody else I don't know you're not getting miracles today no he's making a point with this he's always making a point when he does something miraculous if you don't believe me read through the whole New Testament and look for it it's right there and it is 100% of the time but back to five year old brain me if this actually happened why didn't everybody just fall on their face and total humiliation and be like everything I thought I understood about the world just changed that thing was all twisted up and weird and screwy and I just watched sinews and tendons and muscles knit back together I watched matter appear out of non matter to take your busted up broken shriveled that means less hand and to have it restored to the size and form and function symmetrically with the other hand if I saw that happen now as entrenched as I am in the rules of the natural world the predictability of the natural world guys I don't even know what I would to I guess it would depend on what went along with it and what the little speech was before it and what that person was advocating for but nothing like that happens then I've never heard of any credible claim of something like that occurring I know that some of you my friends are from a tradition that believes that more miraculous things happen all the time I don't know maybe but I have to admit it is weird to me that your tradition doesn't seem to produce a lot of very tangible stuff that if it's as real as this people should be able to go and look at it with the Gestet the scope and a ruler and photographic evidence and be like oh no definitely matter appeared out of non matter that stuff should be on camera everybody has a camera where is it now I think this is special I think this is different and maybe more subtle miraculous stuff still happens maybe I've just never been standing in the right place at the right time but this to me stands out as amazing and paradigm changing like the moment when you're looking down the alley on that home video footage from Brazil in signs and that big lanky green alien walks by and the first time you see it you just go yeah it takes your breath away everything just change I mean it's a there's a there's an alien it's real I just saw it it was on a America's funniest home video style VHS guy it's right there at that kids birthday party are you kidding and it's masterful but here the text is holding it out it's though this actually happened well let's quickly explore the possibilities here one it didn't happen this is a later text that is describing something that is legendary and heroic or Homeric like the old Greek heroes of your who did things that everybody knew in the original audience were completely preposterous but somehow it was illustrating a point could be lots of people think that it could be that we just simply don't understand the language and maybe it wasn't as dramatic as that painting I saw in my children's Bible maybe it's not as dramatic as the language makes it sound I don't normally go through any kind of commentary stuff preparing for this conversation I really wanted to just be raw and untainted with you but I looked at a bunch of them this time around I was like what what do people do with this and the answer is avoid it a bunch of really reputable really good New Testament scholars focus heavily in their chapters on this content on the Sabbath controversy and all of that business and then they're like and then Jesus healed him and that's it like one sentence nothing a third possibility is that it did happen exactly as described and that was baffling to everybody who saw it and because they didn't know what to do with it and because they were so entrenched in what they already thought that rather than this causing some kind of mass repentance it instead caused everybody to double down on the positions they already held that's something that we're gonna break down on the epistemological level a little bit more in the next couple of episodes as we look at the Sabbath controversy and revisit the implications of this shocking healing thank you for supporting me on patreon.com slash the Tmbh podcast every time I go over there and check in and see that people continue to do that I'm humbled and it kind of breaks my brain a little bit because it's free you know I mean you don't have to support anything at all if you don't want to but you do and it sure helps with my family stuff and keeping me energized to stay after this so thank you you are awesome if you don't support the podcast at patreon.com slash the Tmbh podcast you
