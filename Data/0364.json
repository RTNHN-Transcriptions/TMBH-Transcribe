There's the comedy sketch show on Netflix. It came out a couple of years ago. It's offensive. It's funny. The insert that is claimer here. We've all got different tastes. Things are funny, different thresholds of offensiveness, make good choices about what you watch, whatever. We can all get along. It's going to be fine. There is this one sketch that they do on the show where Tim Robinson is an SNL alum and another SNL alum, what's their name? Cecily Strong are together as a couple and they go out to a club and there's a magician there and the magician is asking for a volunteer from the audience and Tim's like, ooh, me, me, me. He's like, oh, there's a guy out there and then he clowns him a little bit. He's like, all right, where's the ball? Nope, it's in your pocket. How'd they get in your pocket? What are you doing? You lying to me? It's just how those things go and it's uncomfortable as those things always are uncomfortable because I know for all of you, it's like clowns. Clowns is a big thing to be afraid of now. I have no fear of clowns. I don't know. They just are what they are. Magicians on the other hand, horrifying me. And I because I think they're going to sneak into my room at night and murder me or hide in the gutters around my street and abduct children. No, they horrify me because they're walking social awkwardness. They put everybody in an uncomfortable situation where if you don't get tricked by it, oh, nope, it's not a trick. It's an illusion, Michael. If you don't get fooled by the thing, then it's awkward between you. It's like somebody who comes up and is like, I have a joke for you. Oh, no. Well, I guess I have to be ready to laugh. It's an uncomfortable thing. And that's what the whole skit was about. But the magician illusionist thing, like, come on, I just want to know how you do it. And I don't want it to be weird between us. And I don't want to have to act fooled. What I want to do is be like, do it again, do it again, do it again, do it again. Let me see the thing until I figure it out. But you can't do that, of course, because that's not what the social contract when you're hanging out with an illusionist entails. But if a dad who has a loving, nurturing relationship with his kid is doing something that kind of tricks a kid and is messing with him, and the kid is like, do it again, do it again, do it again. The dad is delighted. And he just keeps doing it again and again and again. Because there's trust and there's good will, and maybe at work that dad wouldn't like it so much, if somebody was like, do it again, prove it, show me. But the difference between the two situations is, well, is it in good faith? Do you know the other person? Do you love the other person? It is the request for repetition born out of trust and good faith, as opposed to not trust and malice. Oh my goodness, that might be the most roundabout way we've ever actually got to the likewise in one of these episodes ever. But I ain't changing it. Likewise in Matthew chapter 16, we got a situation where the Pharisees and the Sadducees have created an evil alliance to come together to oppose Jesus. They're setting aside their political differences and they want to get to the bottom of this mess and get this Jesus thing over with and out of the way. So they're like, all right, do another trick. And Jesus responds negatively, super negatively. He points to this old Mariners rhyme about looking at the color of the sky and knowing what's going to come next. And he's like, everybody should be able to look at what's going on and understand what the deal is. Why am I not just reading you the Bible? Good heavens, my paraphrase is so much worse. Matthew 16 starting in verse 1. The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. He replied, when evening comes, you say it'll be fair weather for the skies red and in the morning today it'll be stormy for the skies red and overcast. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you can't interpret the signs of the times? A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. So as we started to process through yesterday, the problem here is that there is not goodwill in the conversation. The do it again, do it again, do it again thing is born out of malice and an attempt to trick and catch and expose, not born out of trust and belief that God can actually deliver people than that God has actually sent his son in human flesh to be the Messiah and the Christ and to redeem all things. So we're at a loggerhead here. And then in the final sentence of Jesus remarks here, he eliminates any doubt as to whether the do it again, do it again, do it again that he's getting from the Pharisees and the Sadducees is just, oh, we just missed the signs of the times. We just didn't quite read it right. Our bad or malicious, he attributes it to malice saying a wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign. Okay, let's just hit pause there though, because I mean, everybody in the gospels outside of Jesus is getting treated as though they are in need of deliverance and as though they don't fully get it apart from God. But for a bunch of people, particularly the Gentiles, the centurion, the lady from chapter 15 who was badgering Jesus to heal her demon afflicted daughter, I mean, they're praised for their faith for coming and being like, you could do this thing. Now maybe the distinction here is that the Pharisees and Sadducees are being like, just do a thing for the sake of doing a thing to impress us and prove it. Whereas in those other examples I'm giving, these are people who have a genuine need and in their desperation, they are revealing that the only thing they can cry out to is Jesus. That could be it. But ultimately, I don't really see any kind of formula in the gospel of Matthew so far. For if you ask Jesus this way, you'll make sure you frame it just like this. Those are his keywords and then he'll do it, but don't frame it like this. He'll never work with you if you frame it like that. It seems like Jesus is in charge of his decision-making and he does what makes sense to illustrate points about him and his father and the kingdom. And when it doesn't make sense, he doesn't do anything and in fact calls it out. But the other thing that we notice here is that this rebuke sounds a lot like Matthew 12. No, that way it seems to work throughout the book of Matthew. Somebody has a need and they come up to Jesus and the need is met. Jesus has to go do something else, but people were there who had needs that needed to be met and the needs are met. Some lady just comes up to him and touches him all stealth style and her need is met. Now, the only times that we see people come up to Jesus and be like, do miracles and he's like, how about no? He's right here in Matthew 16, back here in Matthew 12, when almost exactly the same scenario occurs with the Pharisees, not the Sadducees, just the Pharisees coming to Jesus and saying, we want a miraculous sign and he gives them roughly the same answer. Wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but none will be given except the sign of Jonah and then he explains that a little bit more. And then the only other place that I can think of is back here in chapter four and then it's the devil. The devil himself is like, do this miracle. Do that miracle. And as you know, Jesus is having none of that. So it's pretty bad company that the Pharisees and the Sadducees are keeping here and that the devil is the only other person who comes at Jesus with this kind of an attitude and angle about miraculous stuff. So the bottom line is I don't think Jesus is denouncing the idea of faith or believing that God could break the laws of time and space, especially because literally one column over in my Bible here on page 1488, he just praised a lady and said she had great faith for believing that he could do a miracle and asking him for it. No, I don't think it's a prohibition on asking God for the miraculous. I don't think it is a prohibition on believing God can do miraculous things. I think it's a prohibition on doing the do it again, do it again, do it again. That's an assistant thing from a perspective of wanting to somehow control God or make God or Jesus go through the gates of which we imagine ourselves to be the gatekeepers as opposed to that position of a little child being like, Oh, daddy, do it again. Do it again. That is the way the text seems to play out the distinction between the two. And I say all of this is one who leans a bit more skeptical in terms of most miraculous claims. I know that is disappointing to some of you. You've let me know and you've been very respectful in doing so and I appreciate that. But most of the miraculous claims I see in this day and age don't pass muster. They aren't very vetable. I'm not calling anybody a liar. I'm not saying what went wrong. I'm just saying, man, if the stuff that people claim is happening was happening as often as they claim it's happening, you'd think that news would spread very quickly like it did in Bible times. I'm just, I don't know, always going to start with a position of mild skepticism when I hear a miraculous claim. And maybe that's a gesture of not faith on my part. Maybe that's a gesture of me doing what John exhorted his dear children to do in the book of first John and testing everything and holding onto the good and getting rid of the bad. We can come at that with a slightly different orientation. But even as someone who is admittedly a touch skeptical about modern miraculous claims, let me just say that I don't think this text is in any way saying you should not believe in any kind of breaking of the laws of time and space if you're a Christian and you should not anticipate or hope for or pray for miracles because to do so is wicked and adulterous. On more than one occasion in the Bible, the thing that makes Abraham the legendary patron of the whole thing in the Old Testament, the thing that makes him awesome is his belief. Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness. So belief is clearly not being diminished here. What is being called out here is malicious bad faith argumentation. I know this seems like this is the simplest little passage in the world. It just seems like it's a little mariners rhyme and then rejection of the request and that's that. But there's a ton going on here. I thought maybe I could get through it in one conversation, but I'm looking at here. We're not going to get through it in one conversation. So tomorrow we are going to round out this whole exchange. We are going to talk more about this Africa renewal thing that I am very excited about getting you in the loop on. We're hitting pause there. We'll pick up right where we left off. I'm Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
