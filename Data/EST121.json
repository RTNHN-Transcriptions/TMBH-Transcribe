And right now, we're going through Esther. I am a biased person that do not conflate as so many are in the habit of doing right now. With racist, racist is bad. Bias is natural. I think everybody has bias toward themselves and their own circumstances and toward the things they like, to some extent, because you only encounter the world through your own five senses. The way we're built, you see everything through the holes in your head. When pain happens, you only feel the pain in real time if it actually happens to you. I don't feel physically other people's feelings in real time. I can empathize. Mm. No, there may be one exception to that. When we watch fail videos as a family and a skateboarder does some kind of trick where they go down a railing and then they make a mistake and they land crotch first on that railing at high speed. I do feel a bit of parasympathetic tightening in lower regions. So usually you don't feel what other people feel maybe acknowledging that one key exception. Bias is not the worst thing in the world in and of itself, but we all know it can also get us into trouble because it's something that works against us seeing the world for what it is and seeing the world through the lenses of other people. That said, we all know how to take it into account. I try to teach my kids about bias simply by how we watch sports. I'm not a perfect sports watcher. I'm not the kind that melts down and throws things, but I am the type that grumbles and mumbles and fears. I mean, this is just who we are. We don't know how to win a fourth quarter defense. That's our probably go find myself doing that from time to time. It's not the most flattering look, but one productive thing that I'm trying to do to teach my kids about combating bias is every time a call goes against our team, I try to acknowledge that it was the correct call when it was the correct call. Yeah, he did line up offside. Yeah, bomber. No, Murray didn't get his wrist, but look at his hip. He bumped him and that affected the shot. That's a foul. That's the right call. But it's the right call. What I'm doing is I'm just trying to show them, hey, this is what it looks like to try to be objective when things don't go your way and to see it from another perspective. Do I always get this right? No, of course not. I told you right at the beginning, I'm biased because I am, but I want my kids to develop this sense of honest with themselves, taking their own biases into account when they're going through life and looking at things. I also want them to take other people's biases into account as they're going through life. You do this intuitively. I mean, you're just, I mean, you're an interpreter of the world. You're well trained on this. This is one of your superpowers, whether you know it or not. You just intuitively know that when someone is very, very partisan, very biased toward their given thing and they say, oh, this is how the things are and this situation is great. And it's like this, you know to think, well, okay, let's run that through the filter of your massive biases, though. I mean, I don't think that proves anything. Of course you're going to say that. Just from time to time, we talk about life and talk about the process of being a human being and our weaknesses and our frailties. And I just think it's useful to compare notes on that from time to time. Reason number two is because this exact topic comes into play. You didn't see this one coming at the end of Esther chapter six. We get this big parade where Heyman, the enemy of the Jews has to parade around Mordecai and Jude through the city streets of Sousa declaring all kinds of blessings and honor upon him from the king. Mordecai is literally dressed up like the king for this thing. It's a terribly humiliating turn of events for Heyman. And then the event gets over with and like we talked about last time around, we get a little look at their aftermath. Mordecai says in Esther 612, return to the king's gate. The end. We don't hear anything else about Mordecai at this point in the story. He just went back to doing what he was doing. Old men like to sit and talk about the weather. He's right there by the gate because that's where he hangs out. He's one of these people who sit and watches things. But Heyman, we learn a lot more about the aftermath of this and we see him retreat back to the comfort and safety of the sycophantic circle of friends and family, his wife that he went to a chapter earlier when they all decided that they should make a 75 foot tall gallows and stab Mordecai with it and hang him up for everybody to see. He goes back to that and this is what happens. But Heyman rushed home with his head covered in grief and told Zaresh his wife and all his friends, everything that had happened to him. Now this might seem like not bias. This might seem like that phenomenon I was describing a minute ago where, oh, you just have to admit this was a really bad thing. But sometimes that is an act of bias as well. At some point in life, we've all done the thing where a bad thing happens to us that maybe we a little bit had coming and we'll kind of retreat to the safety of our own circle and tell them the bad, bad thing that happened to us and hope that they will prop us up and tell us that those other people are all just jerks and they're just jealous or whatever. Maybe sometimes it's healthy and we need it. Maybe other times not. But this can still be a product of our biases toward ourselves as we go and seek help in crafting a narrative to make ourselves feel better about something that went really, really badly. So earlier in the book of Esther, which is a book full of reversals, Mordecai is the one who is publicly wearing clothing that signifies his shame. Esther for one, when Mordecai learned of all that had been done, this refers to Heyman's plan to kill the Jews. He tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes and went out into the city wailing loudly and bitterly. But then the reversal happens a couple chapters later and now we got Heyman walking home with his head covered in shame. I think this is a little bit different. Mordecai wanted to be seen with his shame because it was an act of public grief, public mourning and public protest. I think we talked about HBO's Rome, which apparently is a wildly influential TV series to me, despite the fact that I haven't watched it in 20 years. In HBO's Rome, you've got an injustice situation between two women from tremendously powerful families. And one of those two women goes out and she stands in the street in front of the estate of her rival, who's wronged her and she wears sackcloth and she just keeps repeating. I think it's Atia of the Juniye. I demand justice or something like that. It's very powerful. It's probably the only line from the entire series that I remember because she said it so dang much, but it was an act of performative public grief that was meant to be seen so that the disgrace of the affair would elicit sympathy and something would have to happen. It would have to be addressed. Whereas this reversal that we see here in Esther 612 with Heyman now covering his head, it's different. This dude does not want to be seen. This is more like the guy leaving the courthouse who has gone through a horribly embarrassing legal affair and the flash bulbs are going as I just don't even look at me. There's no upside for anybody seeing my face. I don't want to be known. I don't want to be acknowledged. And that's right where Heyman is. He doesn't want anybody giving him the apostle Peter treatment and being like, Hey, I know you. Aren't you the king's right hand man? Heyman, the enemy and oppressor of the Jews. Why do you have poop all over your boots? Wait, was that you leading around Mordecai before I didn't even look because I was just so interested in him and all of his regal glory up there on the king's horse? What was that you? Cause I, I, you're definitely Heyman. I recognize you from the thing. Hey guys, the dude who was covered in poop who was leading that horse around a minute ago, that's Heyman the right hand man. Seriously come on. It's him. I'm telling you he's right here. I do not want that to happen. So instead he's not taking the busy streets. I bet he's got his cloak pulled up like some kind of Jedi or a Sassan and he's ducking in the dark alleys and corners trying to find his way across town and in doing so he's probably having to slum it with people way below his station. So this is public demonstrative grief much like what we got from Mordecai earlier, but the nature of Heyman's is totally different. And what Heyman is trying to achieve with this posture of grief is totally different. Well, Heyman shuffles and skulks his way across town. Maybe he lucked out and avoided being recognized, but he makes his way back to the house. And can you imagine the scene when he gets there with his wife and I don't know if his buddy's always just hanging around. I think they just are there on the dole like his entourage or whatever just drinking his fancy booze starting at about 11 30 in the morning when they wake up. I don't know, but for whatever reason they're all there. And can you imagine he shows up maybe he doesn't want to go through the front gate. So he uses the servant's entrance or something keeps his hood down as he comes in that maybe some of the kitchen staff are like master everything. Okay, that's a lot of poop. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Just I just leave me alone. Or did he go right through the front gate to really work the bias sympathy aspect of the thing either way, I'm guessing his wife and his buddies were real shocked when he comes in like that. And they're like, okay, between the fact that as I look out my window to where the giant pole is that should have Mordecai on it by now between the fact that I don't see that. And the fact that you're covered up to the knees in a variety of different types of feces. This tells me something has gone wrong this morning. What's up? And of course in keeping with everything else that we've seen throughout the book of Esther, every time one of these powerful clown king types endures an indignity or humiliation, they just can't shut their mouth about it. They have to go and tell people everything that happened. Exactly what happened. And so Haman does the same in this situation. And we're going to pick up right where we left off tomorrow as we go and look at what their reply is. It's going to be interesting to see how they're biased toward this guy, Haman, who is their meal ticket. I mean, they're not sipping on adult beverages at 11 in the morning being unemployed. If there's no Haman, it's going to be really interesting to see how their biases play out. And if they're going to be able to find a way to put lipstick on this horrible situation, this horrible indignity and prop up their guy or if they're just going to have to admit, wow, that was really bad. We'll find out tomorrow. Quick reminder later this week, we're going to start distributing the digital copies of this massive, really cool, achaemenid empire map so that you can use that as a reference for this whole conversation. I'm going to give that map to literally anybody who is currently supporting the program at any level. And again, we'll start distributing that toward the end of this week. Thank you so much to everybody who supports the program. Thank you all. So I got to say this every time to everybody who doesn't, you don't have to. That ain't weird. Thank you so much for being here. I just love that we get to do this. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
