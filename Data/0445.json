I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and we are inching our way through the Book of Matthew, one little chunk at a time every weekday morning. Right now, we've been inching our way through the first part of Matthew 20, and this, I think, really deep water, very important parable about this landowner who goes out and hires a bunch of people to work, then is vineyard over the course of the day, and he makes a deal with people at the break of day. I was like, hey, I'm going to pay you a day's wage. Come work for me. But then he keeps hiring people at like 9, noon, 3, and then with an hour left to go at 5, he keeps hiring people. At the end, he pays them all the exact same full day's wage, because you understand human nature, the people who were there first, they're like, oh, that doesn't seem like that good to deal, and they're kind of grippy about it. But then the landowner pulls them aside, calls them a friend after they gripe at them. They're like, hey, it's my money. You've got exactly what we contracted for, and if I want to be generous to these other people, don't I have the right to do what I want with my resources? Is there something wrong with you? Or you'd be an envious? And then the parable wraps up with Jesus offering this concluding thought. He says, so the last will be first and the first will be last. But that dynamic there that we talked about a whole bunch yesterday of the landowner talking with the people he employed earliest in the day and calling them friend and laying out his motivations and telling them, like, I set this aside for you. And I did exactly what I said I would do. I followed through on that. But look, if generosity is who I am and I'm going to be generous, you got to roll with me on that. Maybe even participate in that. Don't be envious. Again, that's a lot of paraphrase of what I just told you. But that dynamic that we're talking about there, surely for a lot of you took you right to the most famous parable in, I think, the entire Bible. That being the one you find exclusively in Luke chapter 15, that being the parable of the prodigal son or the parable of the lost son is maybe even a better way to describe it because in Luke 15, the whole context here is lost stuff. You get three parables with diminishing ratios of how much is lost and how much is still held onto and present. In the first of those three, you got 100 cheap, 99 of them are still present. One of them wanders off, the good shepherd goes out and finds the one is super happy about it. There's a whole bunch of rejoicing about finding that one, maybe even more so than the fact that the 99 are still right where they were supposed to be. Then we take that down in order of magnitude. Something I think I said wrong the other day, we were talking about what two orders of magnitude and I think I described it as one. On this podcast, I'm a monster. We go down in order of magnitude and now there's a woman who has 10 silver coins and she loses one of those and she likes her lamp, which costs money to do because you've got to burn that oil and she looks all around until she finds the one and she's really excited and lets her neighbors know that I found that one that was missing and there's this notion of rejoicing. Now there's a ton of rejoicing in the first one when only 1% is missing. There's a ton of rejoicing in the second one when 10% is missing, but then we drop down another order of magnitude with this most famous parable, the longest of the three, that being the parable of the prodigal son. Before we get into that parable, just as a quick side note here, I feel like this numerical reduction structure of Luke chapter 15 is a little bit reminiscent of Abraham's negotiation with God in Genesis chapter 18 for sparing Sodom and Gomorrah. Like, well, what if it's this many? Would you show mercy then? Okay. Well, what if you can find this many people who are still righteous there? Wouldn't you spare it then? Well, what if you could find only this many and it looks like there's a very humanly exchange there is some more profound theology in terms of what God is actually doing there going on, but it looks like what Abraham is doing is feeling out the generosity of God, the extent of God's grace and everything that he negotiates for. God articulates a willingness to go there with him in terms of an extension of his grace. And in the end, it looks like Abraham's mistake was either that he overestimated how many righteous people would be in Sodom and Gomorrah because he got God all the way down to he would spare the cities for just 10. Or Abraham's mistake was that he underestimated how gracious God was because Abraham cuts off the negotiation. God was still with him all the way down to 10. Maybe Abraham should have pushed that a whole lot further. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe that text demonstrates that Abraham underestimated how far God was willing to go with his graciousness. The Old Testament is tricky and confusing at times, especially when it involves destruction and judgment. Maybe you make of that connection or nonconnection here, dedicating resources to go find the 1% when 99% are still there is considered an awesome win when the 1% gets found. Dedicating a bunch of resources to go and find the 10% when the 90% are still there. That's a huge win. Good use of resources. But now we get all the way down to one and one. One is lost. One is found. And in the parable of the prodigal son, the younger of the two sons that this father has goes to his dad and effectively says, I can't wait for you to die. I just really need my inheritance right now. Give me it. And the father is like, okay, don't give me gives it to him. And the kid goes and blows it on stupid stuff and wild living. And he ends up living with pigs and he has a horrible job. It's going to eventually kill him. This isn't going to work out. The kid comes to his senses and he's like, my dad servants live way better than I live right now. I'm going to go back and just beg him to take me on as the lowest of his servants. And then while the kid still a long ways off from the property coming back in shame, the father sees him. So he must have been sitting there looking for him. And the dad doesn't care how stupid he looks to his servants or anybody else. He hikes up his robes and goes sprinting to meet the kid. His heart's full of compassion and he hugs him. And the kid starts his speech and he's like, dad, I practice this. Just hear me out. I sinned against heaven and against you. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. But the dad's like, shut up. And they tells the servants quick, bring the best robe and all the best stuff. My ring back on his finger that says he's my son. He's my kid. He's my heir. So I mean, with that ring, he's declared that he's his heir again, which I mean, awesome for the younger son. Maybe bad deal for the older sons or the other half of that inheritance that this kid just re-inherited is going to come from the dad's like, I don't care about any of those logistics, bring the fatted calf, we're having a feast. My kid was dead and he is back alive, my friends. And so they're celebrating. And of course, the worker metaphorically who's been there from the very beginning of all of these things and has done what he's supposed to do all along is like, dad, come on. What the heck? The oldest son who reminds me a lot of me when my dad was generous to people and didn't take me to show his pizza is like, I'm good. I've done all the things you want. Like, I'm a Christian and I go to church and I support all of your things and I don't listen to bad music. And I'm like, I'm a very, very good boy. I obey and do all of the right things. And like this person is an idiot and they went and have done stupid stuff to put themselves in this position and we don't have like, what are you doing? And then in all three of these parables that we're comparing, the one about my life with my dad in this parable, the prodigal son's dad in the parable of the landowner and the day laborers, the landowner, all three of them, instead of being mad that the one who was there from the very beginning, the whole time is grumbling against them. They instead are immediately patient and gracious and they turn over their cards and they reveal their heart and their priorities and their compassion for the people who were late to the party or who were getting it wrong. But also their compassion and their care for those of us who were there from the beginning and this parable Luke 15 with the prodigal son, the dad tells the kid in response to this. And I love you and everything I have is yours. Whether it's me, whether it's the prodigal son's older brother, whether it's the day labor who got there first, when the provision you receive and count on has been long established. When you've been in for a long time, it's really easy to forget that you were once an outsider too. You once didn't work there, but now you do. You once weren't born, but then you were brought into the world and brought into the family. All three of these parables, two of them Bible one from my life demonstrate that entitlement is a very easy sensation to feel. And in both of these Bible parables that we look at, it's left ambiguous as to how the one who was established responds to the conversation they have with the good father, the good master, where the good father or the good master turns over their cards, reveals their values, reveals that the same character that is provided for you is the exact same character that is providing for this outsider, this one who is in great need. It's ambiguous as to how these well established characters respond to this revelation of the father or the master's priorities and compassion. I like to believe that they both saw it had their hearts softened and were changed by it and gave away what had been given to them, having been humbled and changed by the experience. Thanks for tolerating my side, John into Luke today. I think that passage helps us make more sense of the dynamic we're seeing here in this parable of the landowner and the day laborers in Matthew chapter 20. We'll work on that more next time around a quick. Thanks once again to everybody who really does make this program possible by supporting it at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. You don't have to do that, but you do and it makes a world of difference. And thank you. I'm Matt.
