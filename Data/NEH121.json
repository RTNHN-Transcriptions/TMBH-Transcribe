It's fast, fun, free, daily, deep-dye Bible, and right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy-to-use format at thetmbh.com. Do you ever have the looping dream phenomenon that is obviously not a clinical term? It's just one little kid version of me made up. When I was little, I'm sure we must have been watching the Summer Olympics or a circus thing or something. I must have seen a gymnast with the talc all over their hands and on maybe the uneven bars. They're doing a pull-up, but then they start flipping around and doing loops over and over on this bar. I must have made a mental note of that and I went to bed and I had a really interesting dream. I like my dreams. My dreams are well-structured. They seem like it when I'm dreaming. The story is kind of rhyme and makes sense. I look forward to the resolution. If I have a good dream, that's an interesting story and I wake up and the story finishes out well, it makes for a great day. I love dreaming and I like making a note of how the stories of my dreams work out. On this one, I got stuck in the middle of a really good dream. It was like there was a scratch on the record of my dream and it was on those uneven bars. I was on there flipping around like a gymnast. I would get up to the top with my head pointed toward the ground and my toes pointed toward the sky. I would have just enough momentum to get over that and loop back around and then repeat and repeat. It bothered me that I couldn't get out of this loop. It's like I couldn't break the motion of the whole thing with my mind while I was sleeping eventually. I just woke up after this really frustrating feeling of being trapped in this cycle. I went and talked to my mom about it. I don't remember what she said, but I'm sure it was great because she's a wonderful mom. But isn't the last time it's happened? In fact, I've had a ton of these dreams where I'm enjoying an otherwise very interesting story, but then it becomes very uninteresting because I get caught in some kind of cycle driving around the same loop, big band parliament kind of thing. Or I get lost somewhere and I walk in the same place or I get in a conversation and the conversation starts to skip like a record and I can't get past it. And I never have broken that. I don't know how to get out of it when I'm sleeping, even though sometimes I'm aware of it and I wake up aware that I was dreaming, aware that I was enjoying it, aware that I got into a looping dream or a skip cycle and couldn't break it. It's really oddly frustrating to have those kind of dreams and feel like I can't just stop this with willpower and with my mind. Likewise, if you read through the whole Old Testament, it sort of feels like you're reading a looping dream that has to be very frustrating, not just to read, but for the people who lived through it to feel like, Oh, here we go again and again and again. Maybe there won't be enough momentum to have to do the loop again this time. Yeah, there was enough momentum. We're going to do it again and again and again and again, seemingly forever. It's an otherwise very interesting story, but eventually the looping gets pretty boring and you wonder if they'll ever be a change or if the looping really is the whole story. And in a lot of ways, it feels like the looping that is the cycle of the descendants of Abraham being right with God, getting fat and happy, screwing things up, going through anguish, receiving judgment from God, calling back out to God, God remembering them and keeping his promises and restoring them, them getting lazy and fat and happy during good times, etc. That loop, it's cute and it's charming the first couple of times, but I don't need any moral testament by the time I get to the end of it. I'm like, I get it. We've done this a gajillion times. I don't need any more cycles on these uneven bars. I totally understand it. I get the point. My dreams and the Old Testament are both a metaphor for the cyclical destructive or even just lazy habits that I get into, the humanity gets into. I get it. By the time you get to the end of the narrative chunk of the Old Testament, which we are in as we get to the end of the book of Nehemiah, you're really ready for a change of pace. You're really ready to be snapped out of it and to wake up. In the same way that when you know it's a dream, you can realize this. You have this 10,000 foot view of what your subconscious was doing. So by the time we get to the end of Nehemiah, it seems like there's more of a 10,000 foot you hear from the people who are going through those loops that they're not only feeling it themselves, but they can articulate back to each other what the story is of all of these loops. We've been chipping away at that the last few days. Now we're getting to a part here in verse 26 where we get into a section that deals with that looping dream phenomenon that we experience here in the Old Testament. So you'll recall the last stuff we read about was how God promised to the descendants of Abraham this great land and they went and took it through miraculous stuff of God. And now all of a sudden they're drinking wine from vineyards. They didn't plant and water from wells already dug and they got olives from groves and fruit from trees and abundance. They didn't plant and had nothing to do with and we should be grateful to God for all of this stuff. Verse 26 though, here we go into the loop, but they were disobedient and rebelled against you. They put your law behind their backs before I keep going. Just as a quick reset here. Remember, this is a big corporate prayer being led by Ezra the priest in the fall of 444 BC near the Watergate in this massive gathering of the descendants of Abraham as they try to figure out how to move forward from having rebuilt the temple, a couple generations earlier, survived a genocidal threat one generation earlier and now just having finished rebuilding all of the walls. Where do we go next? Who do we be as a people and they're reciting this prayer together and this narrative is kind of their answer to that question. We are going to be a people of truth who acknowledge the ups and downs of where we have been and who commit ourselves to God moving forward. This is sort of a dark chapter in that prayer. So once again, verse 26, but they were disobedient and rebelled against you. They put your law behind their backs. They killed your prophets who had admonished them in order to turn them back to you. They committed awful blasphemies. So you handed them over to your enemies who oppressed them, but when they were oppressed, they cried out to you from heaven. You heard them and in your great compassion, you gave them deliverers who rescued them from the hand of their enemies. But as soon as they were at rest, they did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven and in your compassion, you delivered them time after time. You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances by which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly, they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. For many years, you were patient with them. By your spirit, you admonished them through your prophets, yet they paid no attention. So you handed them over to the neighboring peoples. But in your great mercy, you did not put an end to them or abandon them for your gracious and merciful God. That what we just did right there is it's more or less the quick version of Judges. And that's merciful at this point in the Bible because if you read through it and you got through Judges, Judges is juicy. Don't get me wrong. It's really fun. Read this very interesting lot of action and stuff in there, but it's also bleak in terms of the picture of paints of humanity and our inability to get out of our loops and our cycles. And indeed, all of Judges really is just a giant series of loops, a looping, waking nightmare that follows exactly the pattern that we just read here in Nehemiah chapter 9, the pattern I mentioned earlier. Everybody's doing great because God took care of them and provided for them. It's like he said he was going to do. That's awesome. Everybody gets fat and happy and they screw around and do stupid stuff and act like they're neighbors who don't know God. And then destruction comes both because it's just not a good way to live and also because God is actively judging them. And then the people cry out and they're like, our bad, we get it again. So, what were we doing? I can't believe we did this loop again. We repent. We're sorry. And then God hears their cry and sends a deliverer, a judge to come and solve their stuff. And then they get fat and happy. Wash rins repeat for the entire book. So in this prayer, what's happening is some very old business with God is getting sorted out here. They're finally owning stuff from almost a thousand years before the time this prayer is being made. Collectively, they're saying, can't remember that whole judges thing, God? Yeah. We haven't really talked about that, but we remember it. And we can see what you were trying to do for us, but we also see what we did in response to that. We see how we responded to your blessing and were shamed and we repent of all of it. And the whole ugly cycle is a result of two things, our constant failure and selfishness and your constant forbearance and patience with us. This is the moment where the descendants of Abraham finally give an honest collective accounting for the debacle that was the era of the judges. And I suppose whether you're talking about addiction or being simply caught in a rut that isn't ideal or maybe even a looping dream or a looping narrative where the story just isn't moving forward, I suppose the way that you get that right or you start taking steps to getting it right is acknowledge the loop. Engage all of the portions of the cycle and acknowledge that all of those seem to keep you from ever catching an off ramp. And then I suppose the next step is figure out where the off ramp is and try to make sure you catch it this next time around. And we'll get into more stuff like that as we continue through this mega prayer of Nehemiah chapter nine. Also the mailing that we're sending out to everybody who supports the program at any level on any platform is all set to go. Everything is all packaged up. We've got the cool Nehemiah achievement unlocked stickers in there. We have got the cool new Galatians notebooks for next season in there. A little note that I wrote I've heard from a bunch of you trying to make sure addresses are up to date and so forth. I think we've done a good job of getting all that integrated and caught up. I know that a handful of you have signed up here in the last couple of days. I'm doing a little bonus mailing. We still have a few open envelopes and we're working on that as well. But the bulk of them as you are hearing this have just been dropped off in the mail and just it's such a big thing. It seems like not that big a deal, right? Like you just get a little envelope for us. It's like this gigantic thing where it takes over the house for a while and we think about it and we're all delighted and eager to make it happen. So it's a huge deal for us. We actually get these things in the mail. So I'm excited for you to start getting that in the next few days. Thank you so much to all of you for being here. Thank you so much to those of you who go above and beyond and support this thing. It wouldn't exist without you. I love that we get to do this together and I'm so grateful. All right. So that is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
