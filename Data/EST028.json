Just the state of things that the house was such that I knew I was in trouble. There was a disarray, maybe some blood. Things weren't right. Mom and Dad would come home and then just look at the thing and be like, uh, uh, uh, this is not how we wanted things to be when we came home. You had better have a very good explanation, young man. And then my fate would of course be determined based on whether or not I had a very good explanation. And likewise, there's a moment in Persian history right at the end of the reign of Cyrus, the great moment where we'd have really our first real hand off of power, where there's a pretty big mess and standing in the middle of the whole mess, looking guilty as a young man named Darius. And it feels as though all of Persia at one moment said to him, all right, buster, we see what's going on here and you had better have a very good explanation for all of this. And it looks as though this young man, Darius, who was in the middle of the mess, did come up with a very good explanation for what had gone wrong. You see, Cyrus the great had, of course, created the Persian empire as we know it in 539 BC. And he reigned for another 10 years. There's somewhere a few chapters into the book of Ezra. We discover that Cyrus must have died because now there's some new king on the scene named Darius. And the transition from Cyrus to Darius was real ugly. Cyrus had a kid who was named after, what would it be? His dad, yeah, Cam Biceys II was the kid's name. And ancient historians, they didn't like Cam Biceys II very much. They were pretty hard on him. They called him the Mad King. They accused him of doing all kinds of stupid stuff when he tried to conquer Egypt. Well, he did conquer Egypt and maybe he did stupid stuff when he conquered Egypt. I don't know. I mean, the king, then he inherited the kingdom from his dad. So who knows what you're going to get, right? But the story goes that Cam Biceys II then died under mysterious circumstances. The rumor is that it was an injury from his lance as he was getting on his horse. He got poked by his lance. And maybe there was something on that lance, whatever the case, he died of gangrene, not too long after. So goes the story. So then the kingdom, of course, would go to his little brother, a guy named Bardiah. But there are some shenanigans that happen quickly upon the death of Cam Biceys II in 522 BC. And all of this is very, very, very, very relevant to the unfolding of the story in the Bible that we're going to be back to here in just a minute in the book of Ezra. So that's what happens. Darius, the young man who was the lance bearer to Cam Biceys immediately gets together with a few of his buddies after Cam Biceys dies. Darius, he already looks pretty bad, right? Because it's his job to take care of lances for the king. And the king died from a wound from his own lance. So Darius decides he's just going to take action. I guess he's going to lean into the circumstances. Maybe he did it. Maybe he didn't. Who knows? But he and six other conspirators are like, we are going to ride east as fast as we can. And we are going to outrun the news. And we are going to go find the king's little brother, Bardi, the second son of Cyrus, the great. And we're going to kill him. And then we're just going to need to think of a story to make this whole thing work. Or at least that's how it looks. So they ride hard across the entire empire. And to help you visualize this, you might remember from a while back we did a bonus episode where we took a map of the Persian Bible world. We laid it over the top of a map of the United States. And I've got a video that might be out by the time you hear this episode. If not, it's coming right up. And it's a video where I ran that simulation just a little bit differently. But many of you had asked to see that visualized. And I'm going to make those maps available to all of you who are patrons here on the podcast side. But I made a video and if you go and look at that video, you will see that the distance that Darius and these co-conspirators had to travel very quickly to outrun the news is the equivalent on a United States map of riding hard from roughly Kansas City, Missouri, all the way to Columbus, Ohio, or almost Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was a very aggressive track that they had to make, but they got over there and they found Bardiad and they killed him. The next morning, they agreed that Darius would receive the throne as a very, very, very distant relative of Cyrus the Great. So news of this gets out. Everybody's like, well, I thought Cam Bicy's was the king. And if he's not, wouldn't it be his little brother, Bardiad, who is Darius? What how do we owe him money or something? What happened? Wait a minute. I'm not even over the fact that we got a bunch of dead kings and stuff. Who is this guy again? And why is he standing over the body of the young man who should be king? And at this point, Darius begins to spin a narrative that would inform the rest of the history of the dynasty that he founds. The rest of the history of Persia is all going to be born out of this particular little narrative. In fact, Darius felt so much pressure to communicate this narrative and to broadcast this narrative and to lock this into the minds of people that he found a chunk of flat mountain near the place where he killed Bardiad. He hired a bunch of sculptors after he was king. He's like, I want you to go up there and in three different languages and in pictures, I want you to sculpt and articulate with language the story, the explanation, the perfectly good explanation. I know this looks weird of what it is that happened here and how I became king. You know what's crazy about that is even though that happened somewhere between probably 520 and 486 BC, we still have it. If you got the right passport, I don't. I can't go to modern day Iran. You can go to modern day Iran and you can look at that thing for yourself and see what Darius himself composed and what he would have laid eyes on many times as he surveyed the work of this inscription on Behiston Mountain or the Behiston inscription. I've got the contents of that right here in front of me. There's some warm up language that is interesting but not relevant to today's story, but then right here on the fourth column of this inscription from Darius, we get the beginning of his perfectly good explanation for this understandably very concerning scenario. But after you hear what happened, I'm sure you will understand. It reads like this. King Darius says, the following is what was done by me after I became king. A son of Cyrus named Kembisys, one of our dynasty, was king here before me. See how he's already saying, oh, I'm a part of the same family, same dynasty. He is a totally different wing of the family. Already he's framing the pitch here to say this is a family affair amongst us. I mean, it's an achaemenid thing you wouldn't understand. He goes on, that Kembisys had a brother. We know him as Bardiah. Sometimes we hear him referred to as smurthes. In this inscription, they say smurthes. So smurthes, Bardiah, we're just going to use them. His bad brother is smurthes by name of the same mother and of the same father as Kembisys. Afterwards, Kembisys slew this smurtis. So Darius is saying, Kembisys killed his little brother. When Kembisys slew Smurtis, it was not known under the people that Smurtis was slain. So not only did dirty Kembisys kill his little brother, he didn't even tell anybody he covered it up. But thereupon, Kembisys went to Egypt. Okay, we know that. He went to conquered Egypt. But when Kembisys had departed into Egypt, the people became hostile and the lie multiplied in the land, even in Persia and media and in the other provinces, you see what Darius is doing. He's like, there's a big lie. It's circulating. You all need a hero to come in and stop this lie. We move on to the next column. King Darius says, afterwards, there was a certain man, a magician, Guamata by name, who raised a rebellion in another province near a mountain called the name of the mountain, Ar-Kaddis, Ar-Kaddis, Ar-Kaddis. I don't know if I said that right. On the 14th day of the month of a certain month, did he rebel? He lied to the people saying, I am Smurtis, the son of Cyrus, the brother of Kembisys. Then all the people were in revolt. And from Kembisys, they went over unto this new false king, both Persia and media and the other provinces. He seized the kingdom and then afterwards, Kembisys died of natural causes. See the way he's dealing with the, hey, you're the lance bear. We heard that he died of a lance wound kind of rumors. This is very good propaganda from Darius. Keep going here. The story keeps getting better. The kingdom, which Guamata, the magician, dispossessed Kembisys of, had always belonged to our dynasty. After that, Guamata, the magician, had dispossessed Kembisys of Persia and media and other provinces. He did this according to his will. He became king. King Darius goes on. There was no man, either Persian or Mede of our own dynasty who took the kingdom from Guamata, the magician. The people feared him exceedingly. For he slew many who had known the real Smurtis. For this reason, did he slay them that they might not know that I am not indeed Smurtis, the son of Cyrus. So this fake magician, shape shifter, he's tricking everybody and anybody who might be able to tell. He's killing them to make them go away. This situation is just begging for a hero to rise up and restore the dynasty of our beloved Cyrus II and his rightful heirs, Kembisys and Smurtis. But who is it who will rise up and correct this lie and right this wrong? There was none who dared to act against Guamata, the magician, until I came. Then I prayed to a Huramazda. That's the god of Zoroastrianism, the Persian religion. On the 10th day of a certain month, I with a few men slew that Guamata, the Magian and the chief men who were his followers at the strongholds called Sikhiavatis in the district called Nysia in Medea. I slew him. I dispossessed him of the kingdom by the grace of a Huramazda. I became king. A Huramazda granted me the kingdom. King Darius goes on, the kingdom that had been rested from our line. I brought back and I reestablished it on its foundations. Then he goes on to say that he patched up all of the damage that had been done to the one true religion by this dirty imposter who he rightly killed. He stresses again and again that he has not established a new dynasty, but reestablished the correct dynasty, the achaemenid dynasty descended from the mutual great-great grandfather of his and of Cyrus the Great. Then he wraps up his inscription. This is very important saying the following. Throughout this inscription there is language suggesting that every future king should protect this inscription because clearly it is correcting a lie. The entire future of the dynasty depends on this story moving forward and that the edicts and the laws and the decisions of the earlier achaemenids like Darius and Cyrus the second before him should be upheld by his descendants and future kings. In doing so this would defeat the lie and the whole thing would hold together. There you have it. That's Darius's story. That's the official narrative meant to correct lies that were circulating about his possible involvement and the death of Cambyses. Clearly the story that Darius is giving here changes the timeline and tries to clarify that for anyone out there to make it clear that Ahura Mazda had determined that Darius should be king and that Darius's kingship is justified and rightful, that he's a hero that defeated the dirty lies of the dirty magician shapeshifter and that he is upholding and restoring the rightful dynasty of Cyrus the second the beloved dead king and that all of Persia obviously owes fealty to him moving forward. Now look this guy clearly felt a ton of pressure to get this out there so much so that he carved it into a gigantic rock for all of time and all of humanity to observe. That means that we can clearly deduce that that is going to be in the back of his mind whenever he is making decisions. So tomorrow what we're going to do is take this newfound knowledge we have about Darius's story that he's sticking to is we're going to look at the book of Ezra and we're going to see how Darius behaves in response to the controversy about the Jews and whether they were allowed to rebuild or not was there needed to Cyrus or was there not and I think we're going to see why Darius behaves the way he does in light of these bigger pressures that he feels about how he came to the throne and this big official narrative he is trying to push out and I think it's going to be a blast. All right more on that tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
