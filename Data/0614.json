It's 10 and 11 year old kids. I'm super excited about this. I've played like a bajillion seasons of baseball. I haven't played some seasons of men's softball as a concession. It's actually more fun than I would have expected it to be. It's just a beautiful game. This sport is my first love. There's no sporting thing more lovely to me than a flawlessly manicured baseball field and freshly cut grass. There is no more elegant play in all of sports than a high bouncing ground ball across the middle of the infield that the shortstop cuts off and throws on the run popping the glove before the runner pops the base for the clean crisp out. I adore this game and it is so fun to get to teach it to kids both because the game is awesome and also because the kids are awesome. But then I'd also add to that because when you put the game and the kids together, you get to teach them the giant things about life. Baseball, for example, is so much about patience and situational awareness. Well, guess what? Every time we do a practice, we run all these drills that have to do with situational awareness. And then that day, we sit them down at the end and we talk about the life skill of situational awareness where we work on some drills that involve communication. And then at the end, we talk about the importance of communication as a life skill. I'm having so much fun. It's a blast. And now we're getting to the part of the season where we're a couple weeks out from games and we have to start figuring out what kid is going to play what position. For those of you who don't know, baseball has nine defensive positions and they are very different, particularly at the level that I'm coaching. Picture, catcher, and shortstop are a really big deal. And you need somebody who can just catch the ball reliably at first base. If you get those things right, you got a chance. So I'm looking at kids and lots of them want to pitch and I'm going to help them all learn how to get better at pitching. But also go on to set the team up for success. I want to set the kids up for success. So at this level, you just need kids who can throw strikes who can throw the ball over the plate in the right place and give the hitters a chance to hit. And they're not throwing a Julian pitches and getting everybody bored and distracted. So guess what? Whichever kids I have who can throw the ball over the plate the most, they're going to pitch the most. And the kids who can't do that yet, I'm going to help them in practice get to a point where they can. And then gradually, I'm going to invest them with little opportunities to pitch and get used to it and grow those into bigger opportunities. And I'm going to do the same with the necessary skill sets that go with first base, catch your shortstop and all of the different positions in the field. And guess what? What I just told you is completely common sense. And all of you are like, yeah, that, I mean, I guess that's probably what you do. And you want to set the kids up for success and the team up for success. Just going to put them in the right positions. And not all those positions are equally important. But that's all right. It's kind of how you grow them. And you give them all little and increasing tastes of more responsibility and more difficult positions and everybody grows and gets better. And that's how baseball is supposed to be. And that's awesome. Well, likewise, in Matthew chapter 25, we got a situation where metaphorically you got a coach and you got three players and the coach is pretty well aware of the skill sets of the three players in the gamma try to set you up in positions to succeed. And he does so this occurs in the parable of the talents story that Jesus tells in Matthew chapter 25, it goes like this. Again, Jesus said it'll be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to him. 20 gave five talents of money. It's an unbelievably huge amount of precious metal bags of gold, big blocks, gold, silver, whatever, to another two talents and to another one talent, each according to his ability. So he gives them all more than enough to make money with this. You have what you need to go out and be productive with what you've been given. But then we get that last little phrase, each according to his ability. Now, if you've done competitive sports, you've coached sports, that is not probably very alarming to you. You're like, Oh, well, yeah, obviously you put people in positions to succeed in this scenario, the master of the house. I mean, his fortunes are everyone's fortunes. They're all vested in this. And everyone's success is going to benefit everyone else in this little isolated community. And so naturally, it would make sense for the master to be so in touch with the skill set of his servants that he'd be like, all right, servant number one, you're a little bit older. You've been doing this for a long time and you kind of got a Midas touch. You've built a good track record over the years of every time you're told, Hey, like go be creative, take these resources, make it into something great. You always deliver. So here's a huge investment. Two talent guy, you're on the rise, you're growing, you're figuring some stuff out, you're taking some cues, you've hit on a few things of late. And you know what, it's time for you to have some more responsibility. We're going to give you a few more reps here. And let's see what you can do. One talent guy. Hey, you're newer at this. I know you're still figuring it out. Like you've had a few tries at it. It hasn't gone well, made a few errors that happens. But I'm still invested in you. And I want you to be vested in what I'm doing. Look, I'm not going to take a gigantic risk and put undue pressure on you and potentially absorb a hit that could hurt all of us. But I do want to raise you up into somebody who can play this position, play in this role. Here's one talent that's still more than enough to do something really productive. Let's see what that draws out of you. I say again, my guess is that for most of you right now, you're like, yeah, yeah, great. That makes perfect sense. It's awesome. But I also know that there is a competing ideology that has been somewhat popular in some global circles for the last 100 plus years. And that is the ideology that says what each according to his ability. What do we mean by that exactly? That sounds a little discriminatory. Like, why are we differentiating between these skill sets? We shouldn't be evaluating people based on what they're good at or not good at. What the master should do if he were truly enlightened and fair is he gives everybody the exact same amount and then whatever happens happens and any failure is actually the masters. In fact, even that phrase, each according to his ability is one that was popularized. It was used before he popularized it, but it was popularized by the ultra famous philosopher Karl Marx in Germany in the 1870s. He had this moral economic maxim that he often repeated and that has been often repeated since by those who think his ideas were good. It goes like this, from each according to his ability to each according to his needs. And what he's talking about here is a utopian idea of how he imagined a society could be in which the government owns all of the means of production and ultimately assigns roles the same way a coach might assign players positions on a team. Then the coach, the central planners, the government would assign each and every person in society a role in the means of production and they would be expected by law and under compulsion to produce in keeping with their talent with their skill set. So Marx acknowledges that people have different talent. And if you have more, you would be expected to do more and give more and contribute more to this centrally planned project. But then the second half of Marx's axiom to each according to his needs means that after we have used the labor of all of the people to produce things through central planning, then the central planners now with all the stuff that has been produced, food, resources, whatever housing, they look around and they're like, all right, well, who needs what? And we're going to dole that out at our central planning office's discretion based on what we think each person needs. I don't know. Sometimes in our conversations, I try to do this thing where I'm like, well, I don't know. You got this idea and that idea. And here's why people think this. And here's why people think that every now and then an idea comes up that I have so much disdain for that I just have to hope that you and I can like each other if we disagree on this one. But I don't even want to hide my opinion. This sounds nice, but it's murderous and awful. I don't like communism. I don't like slavery. I don't like it when individuals try to enslave other people. I don't like it when governments try to enslave people. I think it's evil and wrong whenever it happens in this institutionalized version where you put lipstick on it by acting like it's going to be some kind of utopian outcome and the central planners, they'll get everything right. It doesn't have a good historical track record. And I'm not on board with the ideology that underlies it. Now, you know, my biases, maybe you see it differently. Maybe you have reasons that you like Marx's ideas better, like whatever, I really do think we can get along. But now you know exactly where I'm coming from. The point of the conversation today is not for me to get the opportunity to say that I don't like communism very much. That was cathartic because I don't like communism very much. The point of the conversation today is to say we got to separate ourselves from the stuff that this triggers in us, the debates and the arguments and the Twitter fights and all of that stuff. Nobody in the original audience was looking at this and being like, I just doesn't seem fair, right? Everyone in the original audience. And I think all of us even now, heck, I even think Karl Marx would acknowledge based on the statement, beach, according to his ability that we're at different places in our development and the intelligent manager, be it hopefully a baseball coach or the wealthy owner of an important house way back in the day that any intelligent leader is going to look at the skill sets of the people he's working with and put them in positions to succeed and also be always having an eye for helping to develop the skill set of people in their care to bring them along to a place where they can handle more responsibility. And you do that by dishing out smaller levels of responsibility and using it as a learning exercise. The point is that everything up to this spot in the parable is completely common sense. Theoretically now definitely in the classical world and we're not to the part that's controversial yet. However, that phrase each according to his ability makes it seem to you and me like, Oh, no, now we're into the controversial part. And it's going to screw us up and cause us to misread the parable. Now so far, everything is totally predictable. And what we're seeing here is a basic template of a basically good shrewd intelligent master who is good at evaluating talent, but also isn't putting all of his eggs in the basket of the talent that is already developed. He realizes he's got to keep that pipeline moving and be developing new talent and bringing people along. And the only way you can do that is to give them a chance to go out and play the field and make their mistakes and learn the things they need to learn to take their game to the next level. Spoiler, like just cheating ahead here for our next couple of conversations with that in mind, we better understand why the master's reaction to the third, the one talent guy is so harsh. It's I gave you responsibility. Like I'm developing talent here. Do you not understand the dynamic of what's going on? At the point was go play. The point was do a thing, participate in the thing, understand the exercise. And you didn't understand the exercise. And then you blamed your failure to even participate on my character. Gross. I'll develop some other talent more on that next time around. Thanks for being the one place on the internet where we can disagree about very big, very important things and still hang out together. If indeed you and I do happen to disagree on some of the political economic theory stuff we talked about a little bit today. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
