I mean, if you're being considered at all, you don't get into all the detailed stuff for business you need to conduct. You start by asking about people you know in common and just checking in to make sure everything is good. And it's common sense. It's social common sense. It's also an obvious expression of the genuine care that we have for the people in our lives, even people we haven't talked to for a while. So if I run into a buddy and we're going to sit down and talk shop about some stuff, the first thing I want to know is how is your family? How is your wife? And usually, of course, the answer there is going to be she's great. Now maybe she got a new job and she's really loving the new job and the kids are doing great and the school's going great. You're like awesome. And they ask you and you're like, yeah, this, this, this, this is kind of our stuff. These are the things that we're thinking about right now. And you're like, great. And then you're kind of giving each other permission to take the mental images of all the people who just came up and put them in the green bucket. Like, all right, green check marks, stuff's all right, stuff's good in their world. That's awesome. Thank you for bringing me up to speed on how they're all doing. But. Every now and then you ask how somebody's doing and you can see a little hesitation on your conversation partner's face and you realize, Oh, something's not great. Well, what's up? And then sometimes that just means you don't get down to business or you don't get to talking about whatever maybe you imagined you were going to hang out and shoot the breeze about because instead you're quickly in the deep water and you're hearing about some stuff that people you care about are going through or maybe even people you don't know. But people who your friend cares about and people like you ask questions because you actually care and you know that asking questions is a gesture of support. You're letting the other person talk about their thing. Game it out a little bit. Use you as a sounding board. Maybe even combine the power of your two processors on the problem a little bit. And I guess that's the other reason that you ask is you're trying to figure out what you can do is in a very resource that you might have anything you know, anybody you know, anything that you could do maybe a phone call or visit. Is there anything that you could do to help make the situation better because somebody is having a tough time. I suppose there's even a third level though to this hierarchy of intensity levels of conversation. And that's the kind where you go to talk with somebody and you kind of know something's looming. You're not caught by surprise. It's probably going to require serious action on your part. It's not just going to be a shoot the breeze conversation. It's going to be one of those conversations that maybe even changes the course of your life. And that's the kind of conversation that level three ultra rare mega intense see it coming from a mile away kind of conversation is what the book of Nehemiah opens with. They don't even mess around the beginning of this book. It's crazy. Nehemiah is just right into it. These are words of Nehemiah son of Hakkaliah and boom in the month of kids live in the 20th year when I was in the Citadel of Susah and I one of my brothers came from Judah with some other men and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile and also about Jerusalem. There is no mention here like how we caught up we got a meal. We talked about their trip and everything else and eventually when the mood was right I just asked them just casually. Hey, they got stuff with all of our ethnic brethren and sister and I don't know what the sister equivalent of that. So I don't know. I'm not even faking. I genuinely don't know what the sister equivalent of brethren is. Maybe I'm just totally spacing it. Please feel free to fix that for me. Shoot me a note. So I embarrass myself less on that one in the future. How funny. Well, you know, what's the state of our kin? All the people the returning exiles who've gone. Nehemiah just wants to know. So he cuts right to it or at least that's the way he presents it. And I have to think that he had a sneaking suspicion it was going to be rough. A few years have passed since the mass divorce affair under the leadership of Ezra that we talked about over the last few weeks. And you might have noticed by the way that I haven't really tipped my hand as to what I think about that. I've at least tried to be subtle. I've tried to present it as something understandable. I get why he did it. But I'll tip my hand a little bit right now. I am not sure that in that situation, Ezra was really getting to the heart of what was wrong. I think it's possible he might have been treating a symptom. And I'm not sure that the treatment was the most advisable. Remember that no point does God tell Ezra do a mass divorce prophetically. There's no chariot in the sky or bolt of lightning. Ezra doesn't fall face down and have a vision. And God explains or maybe a messenger and angel shows up and he's so afraid and the angel's like, make a mass divorce happen. We don't see that as was making a call. Now, he's made a lot of other calls in the book of Ezra. And as we discussed, they worked out pretty well. But let's leave that one in the maybe that was the right call. But also it's possible that wasn't the right call category. The Bible hasn't actually affirmed it yet. The Bible has told us that it happened. But what we can easily reason to from what happens in the rest of the text and from human nature is that's going to have a ripple effect. It's going to set a lot of things in motion. It's going to cause a whole lot of tension between these outsiders who all of the other rival people groups in the area are already uneasy with. And it looks like from the perspective of the outsiders who the Bible says had detestable practices. It looks like from the outsiders perspective, they're like, all right, these Israelites are going to play ball. We're going to do peace the way we do peace between families and tribes in the ancient world. We're going to intermarry some people. We've got a mutual interest in our well being. Your grandkids are now my grandkids. Maybe for their sake, we should not stab each other. Maybe you could adopt a few of the practices of my God. I could adopt a few of the practices of your God from their perspective. They are behaving in a very normal way for keeping the peace in the ancient Near East. And then all of a sudden along comes his crazy guy ripping out his beard and he disrupts the entire social stability of the situation. There will be no God exchange. Apparently, well, I want my money back then. And no doubt this was massively tense. What we do know is that Henn and I, which I just love that name. It sounds like that black crow song where nobody knows any of the words. Have a seven zips, dachshkankas, some odd sphinna, Henn and nah, Henn and nah. I can't shake it. It's just in my head. All the time. Don't be surprised if Jeff, who knows what to do, brings us back to that song in case my singing wasn't clear enough as to what it is here at the end of the episode. So they say, yeah, we got a problem. The people who survived the exile. So the idea is like, yeah, we went through this ordeal, but now it's not going so well. So the ordeal isn't over. They're back in the province and they are in great trouble and disgrace. And I think generally when we read Nehemiah, especially when we read it as like some kind of guide to how to be a great leader, which I do not think is the point of Nehemiah at all, nor the point of Ezra, but it's a very popular way to interpret these books. Think about these books, read these books. When we read it like that, I think we kind of skip the disgrace part and we get right to the trouble part. There's trouble. And so the solution here is we got to go build those walls and save the people and protect them. But don't forget whether Ezra is getting every single thing right or not. There's another problem here. It's not just that the walls aren't up. Yeah, sure. The neighbors are angry now. They're mad about probably the divorce thing and probably the barbarians are at where the gates ought to be. But also, Ezra still has an unfinished project and that is just rebuild the soul of the people. So this right here, the first sentence of the report back in Nehemiah 1, 3 tells us neither of the current tasks commissioned by God or through the king providentially that have been handed off to Ezra have been achieved. The disgrace continues, but also now physical danger has been added to the list of threats. Well, okay. I mean, the disgrace we kind of know something about because I mean, just the previous few pages, whether the solution was perfect or not, the disgrace is pretty evident. That's not good. But tell us more about this trouble. Well, the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been burned with fire. Okay. So there was some kind of wall there. Maybe the remnants from 586 of what the Babylonians tore down. Maybe some of that ancient wall. It's funny that that's the ancient wall at this point, but maybe some of that was still standing there and some of the stones have been repurposed. And there is some kind of makeshift wall that was there to sort of keep things safe. But we know from a couple of the prophets who were writing during the time of Zerupa-wall that everybody was really more excited about building their cool Persian style houses with nifty panels and Persian accoutrements. And that's where a lot of the building energy and real focus was going for years and years. And so I think it's pretty reasonable to assume based on the language of those prophets that not a lot of attention had been paid to this wall when it initially got thrown back together to whatever degree it got thrown back together. Now it's possible that when Hennonite says the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been burned with fire, that he still means from all the way back in the day with Nebuchadnezzar. But it sounds like he's talking about a more recent phenomenon. And it sounds like a larger building project was undertaken surrounding the city. People would have wanted to protect their fancy paneled houses with the Persian accoutrements. So it just sounds like they did probably a crappy job on their wall. That's my guess at any rate. So whatever wall was there, whatever paltry protection in name only had been built, it's not working anymore. And now the temple is exposed. And now all of these people living in their now 80 year old Persian paneled houses with fancy Persian accoutrements, they are all exposed to raiders or anybody else. This does huge damage to the local economic prospects because that gate enables you to secure wealth. You don't have the gate. You can't secure wealth. Your city is just bleeding in the angel. It's bleeding money. It's bleeding resources all the time. And further, if you don't have those walls up, you don't have a garrison. You don't have a group of troops, either volunteer or maybe even semi professional at this point who can camp out and rest and secure a territory. A secure walled city has an orbit effect. It's like a drop of bleach and a petri dish, the bigger the drop of bleach, the bigger the garrison behind walls, the larger the sphere of influence and the more all of the things around the city can be patrolled and controlled by the forces within the city and the economic and cultural radiation center of gravity of the city. So the walls are a big deal. The bigger deal than probably you or I would naturally imagine, we'll keep talking more about that as we get more into it. But the report here is bad. It's not a friendly catch up session. It's not one of those conversations. It's nice in the moment that you forget later on. This is a life changing report for Nehemiah, something that can be summarized in just two sentences. The people are still in disgrace. That problem is not solved. And physically, the threat is very real and we got to take care of that. Nehemiah knows this is a big deal conversation. This isn't some passing fleeting thing. So it says, when I heard these things, I sat down and wept for some days. I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. And then we'll get into what he decides is his role in this whole thing next time around. But I will say this, this is an intense conversation about a bona fide problem on two fronts. And Nehemiah, he might be positioned to really whip some things into shape and do something to make it better very, very quickly. Like I said, we'll see where that goes next time around. All right, that's it. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
