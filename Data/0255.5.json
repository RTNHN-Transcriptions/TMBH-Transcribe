The episode you're about to listen to is part two of a topic that Matt introduced in episode 255. So, if you haven't listened to that one, you should listen to that one first before moving on to this bonus episode. Speaking of bonus, here's some bonus intro music. Welcome back my friends. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and what we're digging into right now, once again, is the question of whether or not Matthew 1127 was in the original text, or if maybe as some have suggested in the last few centuries, some later editor came in and added this verse, this phrase from Jesus to bolster the gospel of Matthew's effectiveness and clarity on really nailing the Orthodox Christian position on the nature of the father and the son and how they relate together. So, where we left off was we were on our way over to a verse where actually there is a reasonable case to be made that a later edition may have occurred that was trying to advance the idea that Jesus is the son of God. If you had to act 837 right now, you're going to see something really interesting depending on what kind of Bible you use. Physically, if you have a Bible, grab it right now, flip over to act 8. I don't normally ask you to do that, but if you got one, step away from your sweaty treadmill and pull out the Bible that you no doubt keep in your unitard pocket and just take a look. Okay, Acts 836, as they were traveling along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, oh, there's a eunuch in it, by the way, look, here's water. Why shouldn't I be baptized? There is no Acts 837. Now some translations, the King James Version chief among them, have Acts 837, but the rest of you are going to have to look down in your footnotes, oh, yeah, here we go, verse 37. Some manuscripts have this. If you believe with all your heart, you may. Oh, okay, so you may get baptized, the eunuch answered. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Well, obviously, Acts 837 is very biblical. I mean, we looked in the previous episode at how many passages that talk about Jesus as the Son of God, and we're going to look at a bunch more today as well, but Acts 837 has shaky early manuscript support. Now I know there are some of you right now who are really frustrated with what I'm saying. You're like, no, it does not have shaky early manuscript support. There's one family of manuscripts that I think are reliable. The other I think is totally bogus. And look, I'm not trying to pick a fight with you. Objectively, I think this verse is beautiful and it sounds like the rest of the Bible. And maybe it was in the original manuscripts, the people who look at the collection of Greek manuscripts that we have and add them up and wait them in terms of their reliability and their earlyness made the determination on a lot of translation committees that the support is not strong enough to have this verse in here, that it looks to them like it may have been a later edition or clarification. So they put it in the footnotes. Some other people come to a different conclusion. My point is this. I get how a critic might say, well, I mean, of course, Matthew 1127, the business about Jesus saying all things have been committed to me by my father. Of course, that could be a later edition because we've got reasonable evidence to suggest there may have been a later edition in what would be labeled acts 837 on exactly the same theological subject matter. But here's the difference for me. I hang out a bunch over on the Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts website. It is an amazing project where very hard working people have taken every little fragment, every great big manuscript collection, and they have carefully catalogued them, photographed them, and put them on the internet in a searchable format so you can go and look at all of these early Greek manuscripts for yourself, the stuff that makes the Bible. You can do the work to go see that if you'd actually like to, which is amazing. And as I go and look at the support for acts 827, yeah, I understand the case for why that might be a later edition. The earliest stuff doesn't seem to support that, but I don't find the same results in Matthew 1127. I can look at this myself, and even though my Greek isn't great, I can read it, and I'm looking at all of these. I have it up in front of me right now. These manuscripts are like kids. They all get assigned a likable name, and you start to remember some of the significant manuscript names is cute. I'm looking at a bunch here from the Chester Beatty or Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Rolf's 961, 962, 964. All of these date between the 100s and 300s AD, and the language is there. Matthew 1127 is present in all of this. And then I went and read through a bunch more of these papayri that include Matthew 1127, and there are dozens all dating to this same time frame. And they all seem to say the same thing, the only point of variance that I am finding as I glance through these, and some of them are a little bit hard to read because they're old and the handwriting is tough, is at times there's disagreement on one of the statements of the father versus my father. But there seems to be agreement on my father in its first use in 1127. All things have been committed to me by my father. It looks like there's a little bit of a variation in the ensuing uses of the father versus my father. But I also went and looked at the eclectic Greek text. This is getting overwhelming. Hang with me. This is going to make sense. The eclectic Greek text, which is the one that takes into account all of this data and tries to distill it back to what our very best approximation is on what the original language must have been based on a whole lot of criteria that you evaluate the credibility of these manuscripts based upon. And I also went and looked at the much older Westcott and Hort text, which is, I think, this 19th century attempt at evaluating all of these manuscripts as well with maybe a little different weighting and evaluation system, but they both come to the same conclusion as well. My point is this. If somebody wants to say that Acts 827 doesn't have rock solid manuscript support, I would have to say even though I really like the verse, and even though I theologically think the verse is supported by the entire New Testament, it's not saying anything crazy or novel, I have to admit, the text evidence for it is not rock solid. However, the text support for Matthew 1127 looks very, very solid. In fact, I can't find any deviation that would cause me to question why this is in the text. So once again, some very, I'm sure, fair-minded scholars who I do not want to demonize at all because they read data a little different than me or throw out a different theory than me, some have suggested that maybe Matthew 1127 and all of this language about the union between the father and the son is a later addition, a cave of wonders that was added after the fact to make something work better. I don't agree with that assessment based on my own first-hand text research that I did in preparation for this conversation. I also don't agree with that assessment based on everything you and I have looked at in Matthew so far and everything that's coming up in Matthew later on. The son of God stuff is all over the place here. In fact, it's all over the place in all of the Synoptic Gospels and it's all over the place moving forward in the New Testament. I mean, for a kind of loud mark opens his gospel. Literally the very first line of mark, and yes, I'm stalling because I can't seem to find mark right now. My fingers are not cooperating. The very first line of mark says the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the son of God. I mean, how can you argue that the synoptics don't have the son of God language in it? It's all over the place. Mark 1539 has the centurion at the crucifixion saying the same thing that is recorded in Matthew. Surely this guy was the son of God. Luke 338, if you remember this from way back in the day when we were looking at the genealogy of Jesus at the beginning of Matthew, we compared it quickly to the genealogy of Jesus in Luke, which runs the other way from right now backwards. And it ends like this, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalal, I don't know, the son of Canaan, the son of Enoch, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God, like the Lion King. The son of God, take that. Luke is crystal clear. I think the birth announcement in Luke has son of God language as well. Yes, it does. Verse 35 of Luke 1, the angel answered, talking to Mary, the Holy Spirit will come upon you in the power of the Most High will overshadow you, so the Holy One to be born will be called the son of God. Even while trying to fair-mindedly acknowledge the lack of textual support for the son of God claim in Acts 8, 27, I don't really stress about that that much because I don't need that verse because you flip around into Acts chapter 9, like it's on the same page. And it says, at once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the son of God. That's Acts 9, 20. So Luke is not shy in the book of Acts about hitting that point, even if Acts 8, 37 was a later edition. Hebrews has son of God language, like four times, maybe five times. Revelation chapter 2 has the resurrected Jesus calling himself the son of God, and then in Paul's epistles, maybe another four or five, six times, and I think Acts has the son of God language right around the conversion account of Paul as well. And look, my friends, I know this is overkill. For a lot of you, you're like, oh my goodness, Jesus is the son of God is like one of the most foundational, obvious points of Christian theology. I mean, the Orthodox, the Catholics, your Pentecostal types, your fundamental is like, everybody agrees that Jesus is the son of God, Matt, you can knock it off. We're all in. We're all good. Even probably a lot of you are like, I don't even think there's a God. And I know the Bible says that Jesus is the son of God. I'm good. Look, you're right. This is totally overkill, but the implications are so dang big, my friends. And you and I, we set out on this thing together to try to be fair to the text, to try to let this thing with as much of a departure from my stupid biases as I can muster, we're trying to let the text say what the text says, because the stakes are huge. I mean, it's your soul. It's your ideology. It's your values. What values you embrace, kingdom values, world values. If this claim is here and this claim is so pivotal and so central, we better just do the dang work instead of saying, well, people with pointy hats or people who preached very enthusiastically and got super sweaty, they told me that Jesus is the son of God. So you know, that's absolutely fine. We should look at all the data we have in front of us in terms of the text. The point is this, if you poke around on the interwebs, if you read some books, some honest thinking people are going to suggest that maybe the son of God stuff in Matthew and the synoptic gospels might be a cave of wonders, a later edition meant to bolster somebody's claim to something. I'm telling you, as best as I can read it, the textual evidence does not support that criticism. Act say 27, fair criticism, but the claim that the son of God is a later edition to the synoptic gospels. The data just doesn't support that. Everything we have says these themes, these statements and this theology was baked into Christianity was baked into the teachings of Christ from the very, very beginning and further the sheer volume of references from Jesus and about Jesus regarding the idea of him being the son of God, God in the flesh and in a unique relationship with the father. There's just too much volume to dismiss it all as some clever power play or game that happened after the fact. Bottom line is this, you don't have to think Jesus was the son of God. You don't have to think there's a God at all. It's the internet. I'm not in charge of anything. What I want to do here is put fair data and information in front of you. Whether we reject or accept the idea that Jesus is the son of God, I want to do it with eyes wide open, eyes wide open research, eyes wide open faith, if that's where you land and hopefully a fair treatment of the data so that we can accept it or reject it based on what it actually is. I realize we went all the way to Nerdville in these two episodes. Hopefully you understand why and had fun hanging out with me and gaming all of this stuff out. I promise we are about to get into what this passage actually means and what the theological implications of that are. We'll do that next time around. I'm Matt.
