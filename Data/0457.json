You know the return of the king by Jair are token. It's not a coincidence that sounds a lot like what we're looking at in Matthew 21 here, right? I think it's pretty clearly intentional on the part of token that the character of Aragorn in that story is this long promised king. There's prophecy, there are indications there, much like we keep saying about the book of Matthew. There are a bunch of boxes that needed to be ticked and Aragorn, this ranger, he's the completion of the story. He's the guy who's going to come and restore the thing. He fits everything just perfectly. And so the third installment, the third book, the third portion of the Lord of the Rings series is the return of the king. And it explores a whole bunch of these same themes that we're looking at here down the home stretch of the book of Matthew and in that book when the king returns, it's not that splashy in terms of regal procession and all of that. It's a bit more military in nature, but it's interesting because the story unfolds. Aragorn in a way has to conquer death and defeat death and subjugate death in order to come and also subjugate the hideous forces of ugliness and evil and depression and abusive power and pretender kings and dark spiritual forces. And again, the Lord of the Rings is not an allegory. It's not like the Chronicles of Narnia. It's not like CS Lewis's work or John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress where everything exactly means something else. It's imagery. It's thematic material. Maybe some of it's very, very on the nose. Maybe some of it is more loosely connected and it's just an overflow of Tolkien's faith and understanding of exactly this story that we're looking at right here where the people of Jerusalem are experiencing the return of the king. And in this case, the return of the king doesn't involve anything military whatsoever, not even hints of anything military. If there was any question about whether this was a military return or a military messiah coming in to cause a revolution that is immediately dismissed by the telling detail that we started looking at yesterday that we pick up right from the beginning of Matthew 21 about the vehicle of entry that Jesus chooses for arriving in Jerusalem as its king. Says, as they approached Jerusalem and came to Beth Fage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples saying to them, go to the village ahead of you and at once you'll find a donkey tied there with her cult buyer, untie him and bring him to me. And if anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord needs them and he'll send them right away. And this took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet. Say to the daughter of Zion, see your king comes to you gentle and writing on a donkey on a cult, the full of a donkey. The century is a little bit evocative of the concept of the peace being represented by the lion and the lamb, laying down together and being chill. And in this case, again, it wouldn't be how we'd think of it because we think of very different militaristic terms in terms of the weapons of war and the images of war and everything that we're used to. The difference between a donkey and a war horse, a stallion, a charger would be massive in terms of meaning, in terms of just what it communicates to people. If somebody shows up to a meeting or a confrontation or a showdown that looks like it's going to be pretty tense and they're wearing a bulletproof vest and camouflage, fatigues. And in addition to be an armored up, they got their sidearm. Maybe they have a rifle or something slung over a shoulder. You're like, oh, dang. Okay. Well, I can see what the game plan is here. Like we are ready for war. This guy's loaded out for it. And I can see where this might be headed, whereas if somebody shows up to a meeting like that and they don't bring their entourage with them, they come unarmed and they're wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, that's pretty disarming. That has meaning as well. And in this case, showing up on a donkey that isn't exactly great for leading a cavalry charge against your enemies. It doesn't give you that strategic height advantage in the battlefield or as you ravage through the city streets of being able to strike downward with the force of gravity for sword blows upon people who are on foot. There's just no advantage to a donkey. You'd be better off on foot. This in itself is a gesture of humility, a gesture of what the priorities of this king are as he shows up. And in addition to these big picture observations about the style of the return of the king that we've been talking about yesterday and today, it's also kind of fun to just look at the narrative here, how this thing unfolded. Like, oh, we're just going to get a donkey. Okay. Well, like we don't really have a ton of money. We haven't had things like that in the past. Oh, yeah. There's the village up there. Go to it. There'll be somebody there and the donkey will be standing there and there'll be another smaller one right there. And all you got to do is just be like, oh, my lord needs it. And they're going to be like, okay, that's the exact opposite of what happens in every single movie when there's a chase scene and somebody runs out and they just like grab somebody's motorcycle from them or there's a car left running and they jump in. And the poor dumb bystander goes running after them and always yells the same line, Hey, you can't do that. Come back here. And they're like, ha ha, I'm in a chase. I have to do that. But the protestation is part of the fun of that style of movie, that little genre, that little trope here is really no indication that there's going to be resistance at all. Like, oh, well, I didn't use you to say so. I mean, if the lord needs it, great. There's not even indication that the person is going to ask like, which one again, and we get a lot of these messiah types that come through here, I just want to make sure that your credit's good. Nope, nothing whatsoever. Like, it's kind of reminiscent of the whole calling of the disciples at the end of chapter four, I was like, yeah, just down. I know guys come with me. And they're like, okay, yeah, cool. Unemployment's fine. Sure. We're with you. Just that simple. This would seem to be another touch on that theme of the power of the command of the call of Jesus and that though he looks modest and comes in this modest way, he still wields such great authority, but he doesn't really have to say anything or do anything for that to be evident. It's actual authority, the kind of actual authority that caused people's jaws to drop at the end of the sermon on the mount as they realize that this was legitimate and not the kind of limp, impotent teaching that they heard from their teachers of the law on a daily basis. Well, Matthew, as he is often in the habit of doing, especially early on in his gospel, is pointing out that this is somehow connected to things that happened in the Old Testament. This is yet another ba ba ta ba ba ta ta of the Old Testament. And here it's a reference. Well, I thought it was a reference to Zechariah 9 9, but my Oh yeah, it is. Okay, it's Zechariah 9 9, but apparently this is a double reference here in Matthew 21. And I don't know. Let's just look it up and learn about it. I remember the Zechariah part of this, but my old notes here in my Bible margin are saying that it's somehow a combo reference in this prophecy quote to Isaiah 62. We'll find out in a second. Zechariah 9 is pretty interesting because it looks like it's alluding to maybe the Alexandria in conquest. Maybe what was going to happen as the Greeks and Macedonians marched all around the world. That's at least how a lot of people interpret it. It fits timeline wise with what Zechariah is doing. And it gives us one of the really profound tea, the ball up kind of prophecies from the Old Testament that get fulfilled in the New Testament. And so while acknowledging that it looks like that a bunch of Zechariah here might be talking predictably about the Alexandria in conquest and the dispersion of his territory to his generals, the diadoki that happened afterwards. And then the oppression that would happen under the salucid empire that resulted in the Maccabees family coming around and throwing off the foreign Greek overlords acknowledging that it looks like contextually it might be pointing to all of that stuff. In the middle, we get this passage that Matthew, Christians believe under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, ties into the arrival of Jesus. It goes like this verse 9, rejoice greatly. Oh daughter of Zion, shout daughter of Jerusalem. See your king comes to you righteous and having salvation gentle and riding on a donkey on a cult, the fall of a donkey. I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the war horses from Jerusalem and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth. So no matter how you read the context here and Zechariah, and again, even though I think the strongest case for how to read Zechariah, and at least in this chunk is that it's predictive of what's going to happen in the intertestamental period with Alexander the Greeks and everything that comes afterwards, you could read this in any way you want and be like, no, I think it corresponds more neatly to that. It doesn't matter. The take home is the same for that passage that I just read you. It's a description that somehow when the actual king shows up, when the return of the king happens, it's not going to be militaristically. It's not going to be grand in the way that you expect. It's going to be disarming, literally and figuratively. It's going to be representative that you can put away the war horses from Jerusalem. How crazy is it that that linguistic contrast is so present right there? The donkey versus the war horse again, or something pulled by war horses, the chariots of Ephraim. I will take that away. We'll put away this stuff. The battle bow will be broken. There'll be peace to the nations and this greater rule is going to extend from sea to sea. Maybe the people of the day read all of the Zechariah stuff differently and didn't quite know what to attribute or liken all of that to. But this pops when your king shows up, rejoice greatly, oh, daughter of Zion. That's just a way to describe the people of Israel because the thing has happened, the thing you've been waiting for that you should be excited about. But I want to know what the deal is with what my notes are telling me is going on in Isaiah 62. So I'm going to turn over there and we're going to look at it together and we're going to find out together because I'm learning here as Isaiah 62 11 says, the Lord has made proclamation to the ends of the earth. Say to the daughter of Zion, see your Savior comes, see his reward is with him and his recompense accompanies him. They will be called the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord and you will be called sought after the city no longer deserted. Okay. I see it. The text itself does not say that this is a fulfillment of what we said through the prophet Isaiah or the prophet, Zechariah. It just says through the prophet to me, I mean, just off the cuff here, it looks like it's more directly corresponding to Zechariah. But in light of what's going on at the end of Isaiah, Isaiah 62 is things getting put back together in Israel 61 is the Messiah's work with the people of Israel. So it sure fits thematically with what's going on here, even though the language isn't quite as smoking gun. So maybe Matthew is doing an amalgamation of these two passages a little bit. The meaning of both of them seems to be the same. Those Zechariah seems to speak to it a little bit more specifically. Whatever the case, I got to think that the original audience was tracking with this and that nobody would have been like, wait, the prophet didn't say that. Otherwise, Matthew would have looked like an idiot in this book, Wouldn't have stood the test of time, clearly he understood the reference and understood his audience and how they would respond to the referencing clearly as modern readers. It's not very tough for us to look at this and say, oh, well, yeah, there you go. It's that imagery again of the return of the king, but the return of the king is not going to look like the procession, the reception, the conquering entry parade that you would get with a normal king and Alexander style king, a calligula style king. This is a different king conquering in a different way. And as a result, this king is going to show up in a different manner that is in keeping with what this conquest truly is and with what's actually being conquered. And that is not a conquest of this or that political entity, but rather a conquest of death itself, a conquest over a broken world system with a superior lasting eternal kingdom system that everybody is invited to, that people who become part of this thing become sons, daughters, heirs, agents, inheritors of this greater, more real kingdom under this greater, more real king. Interesting. We have more to do here next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
