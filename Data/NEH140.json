We've been looking at it now for a hundred and whatever episodes together, and I think we can all see the same thing structurally at the beginning of the book. There's a problem. It opens far away in Sousa in the East and Persia, but there's a problem back out West in Jerusalem. Nehemiah makes it his problem. The geography of the story moves from way out east to way out west as Nehemiah goes to Jerusalem. And now he's in a little rougher spot. Things aren't so cushy as they were back at the Capitol. The king's a long ways away and he's got Nehemiah that is, got to demonstrate. He's going to use all these smarts and his cleverness to cut through all of the obstacles and get these walls built to preserve the people. But there's an undercurrent all the way through the first half of Nehemiah during the rebuilding of the walls phase. And the undercurrent is that it isn't just the walls that need to be rebuilt. The walls are kind of a metaphor in their tumbled down state for a people who are in a tumbled down state of people who are in disarray. They've had flashes of brilliance over the course of their 2000 almost-ish year history at this point. Struggle, but they keep struggling to get out of their own way. And now there's a little glimmer of hope. There's an opportunity here to rebuild something that was lost or maybe to make something and realize it fully and truly for the first time ever. First half of Nehemiah is about the metaphor, the walls, which did need to be rebuilt. But the second half of Nehemiah is about the rebuilding of the people. What Nehemiah is trying to do along with Ezra is get everybody in the right spot, get all of the money in the right spot, get all of the plans in the right spot, get all of the rules in the right spot, get the heart of the people in the right spot, get the religious expectations in the right spot, get the relationship with Persia in the right spot. And you can't just do it with anybody because to be in the right spot, if you are an ancient Jew in the fifth century returning from Persia to rebuild in Jerusalem, it's not just anybody who can do it. It's a family. It's an ethnic thing. You need people who are descended from the right people to be in the right spot. It all seems very particular. It all makes more sense as you read through the larger picture of the Old Testament. But what we've seen here is that Nehemiah has a big challenge on the front end. Go fix the walls. Go fix the town and a big challenge on the back end, get all the people where they need to be and get everything positioned properly to rebuild the people or maybe in a way to really build out the people properly for the first time ever. In the spirit of that, we've read a bunch of names yesterday in Nehemiah chapter 11. That was a list of all the people who either by volunteerism or by casting of lots would be given the task of repopulating the long abandoned, but recently rebuilt city of Jerusalem and living inside her walls. And with the little bit that we're going to look at here to round out Nehemiah 11 today, we're going to account for the people who didn't live inside the walls because there's some of that going on as well. More on that in just a minute. Okay. If you're Nehemiah, here's the question of Nehemiah chapter 11. How many people does it take living in Jerusalem to accomplish your goals for it to feel like a city, for it to have the buzz and the economic center of gravity and the religious center of gravity and to have the diversity of skills and talents that you need for it to be a city, to be a cultural hub? How many people does it take to make all of the public works go such that you've got that covered, but you've also got room for artists and thinkers and musicians and so on and so forth. Well, I think we can probably, if we use this calculator, I've got over here in my right hand, get pretty close to triangulating what Nehemiah's preferred number was. We get a bunch of numbers here in Nehemiah 11 of how many people got assigned. So from the descendants of Judah, remember that's Athiah, son of Uzziah, there's a whole bunch of names there. It's 468 men. And in the next section of Nehemiah 11, we see the descendants of Benjamin amount to 928 men. The second, I'm going to add all this up as we go. Okay, 468 plus 928 should have been doing this from the start. Then from the priests, we see that we got another 822 and also from the priests from maybe another family. And then 42. And then also from the priests who end their associates, we got another 128. Great. Then from the Levites, it looks like we've got another 284. This is going somewhere. You got to trust me. We're doing math. It's important from the gatekeepers. We get another 172 people. And then the rest of the Israelites were in the towns of Judah. Okay. I think that pretty much covers us for the hard numbers. So I got 3,044 people who we have accounted for here on this repatriation list in Nehemiah chapter 11. And correct me if you added that up and you have it differently. But these are just the men. These are the heads of the household. So we got to figure out what our multiplying factor is going to be to get that out to total population. I'm just going to ask my telephone and see what it tells me. How many people were in the average ancient household? I don't know. Do that seem like a good question? What was the average number of people? Okay. 428 in the ancient world. 5.6 is what we're getting over here. All right. 5.3 is what it's saying for ancient Athens. Okay. I feel pretty good saying that about five and a half is the middle number of all of these different estimates that I'm seeing. So then all we simply do is 3,044 times 5.5 equals 16,742. So that's a pretty nice sized town in my state of South Dakota that would rank sixth, a little bit bigger than Yankton, a little bit smaller than Watertown. But even most of the really big cities in the ancient world weren't that huge just because the infrastructure can only support so much. So people needed to live out in the surrounding villages. My guess would be that the original audience would have understood these numbers that we've got here and they would have projected them out in their brain and been like, well, 16, 17,000 people, something like that. They would have understood that to be an instantly pretty significant city here in Jerusalem. They just went from nothing to something super fast. Like back in the day in the seventies, I think they built Cancun out of nothing in Mexico and it went from zero to however many people live there. The day they opened it overnight or whatever. It's that kind of thing like city in a box just sprung up out of nowhere over the course of really just a few months that it took for Nehemiah to get there, rebuild the walls and get the thing repopulated. Let me try to come at this a different way. The estimate for the population at any given time of the whole world during the Aquaman Empire, I think some like 110, 120 million people and Persia was estimated to be a third of that. So call that 40 million, which is amazing by the way. So 40 million people in an empire that is just geographically huge, if you look at it on a map. So I've got to thank even if you come at it that way, Jerusalem's a pretty big city at 16, 17,000 in an empire of 40 million. I mean, the United States has what 330 million and 16 or 17,000 is still a pretty good size town here, but reduce the size of the United States by, you know, take it down like one 10th or to one ninth of the current size. And I think a city of 16 or 17,000 would pop even more. Okay, that's a lot of thinking about this, but I really, I like to try to do this math from time to time so that instead of it just being a bunch of names and a bunch of numbers that kind of roll past us, we actually stop and think about, okay, well, would that have been impressive or what is that a lot of people? Is that pretty good? Is this a blemish? Is this a black guy? Were they silly to feel good about this? And everybody else would have been making fun of them like, oh, 17,000 people, that's super good. Great job. Or would everybody have been like, oh my goodness. And like four months, they went from no walls to a restored ancestral capital city that the better part of 20,000 people in it. This is amazing. Clearly the blessing of their God is upon them. Clearly they worship the one true God. Well, the math that I just ran tells me that I think it's far more likely that people would have looked at these numbers in that ancient numerical population context and been pretty dang impressed. I think it's way more likely that that would be their response outsiders. That is then that people would look at it and be like, yeah, not that big a deal. That's not that impressive a thing. I think everybody would have thought this was pretty rad. And further I got to think that when Nehemiah went home and Arteserxes got the report about how everything worked out, he would have been like, dude, that's downright competent. Great work. That's really impressive. I maybe Arteserxes maybe it would have been a good enough thing that he wanted to pat himself on the back for it as well. This feels like really quite the achievement. Even if you could pull it off now with our modern context of numbers, but in an ancient numerical context feels all that much more impressive. Well, a bunch of people didn't live in the town. As always, you got the folks who live on the fringes of things and the very end of Nehemiah 11 accounts for that. Here's a quick rundown of how that went. As for the villages with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kuryath Arba and its surrounding settlements in Dibon and its settlements in Jakobzil and its villages in Jeshua, in Molada, in Bethpelet, in Hazar Shual, in Bersheba and its settlements in Ziklag in Meccona and its settlements. On any of these, are you like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that place. I'm guessing there's not a lot of these locations that I'm reeling off here that are ringing bells for. Verse 29, in Enrimon, in Zora, in Jarmouth, Zanoa, Adalom and their villages in Lachish, you have heard of that one. That's the city that the Assyrians laid siege to and then made a really cool relief telling the story. It's very, very violent. I mean, don't bring the kids and its fields and in Azakah and its settlements, they were living all the way from Bersheba to the Valley of Hinnam. I've heard of that one. The descendants of the Benjomites from Geba lived in Mkmash. I was like that name. Ija, Bethel. I know that one. And its settlements in Anathoth, Nob and Anania, in Hazor, Reimah and Gittaim, in Hadid, Zeboim and Nebalat, in Lad and Ono and in the Valley of the Craftsmen. Some of the divisions of the Levites of Judah settled in Benjamin. I think it's cool. There's a place called the Valley of the Craftsmen. I just underlined that in my main Bible. I don't know what that was. It seems like a really cool place where maybe like trade people hung out and train apprentices and stuff. I want to learn more about that. That's it. That's all of Nehemiah chapter 11. It really is sort of just a taking care of business kind of chapter. But I think in light of what we talked about today, it's a taking care of business kind of chapter that wouldn't exist if it didn't look good and if it didn't back up and undergird the story to anybody who would read it, that this was a huge win and a huge success and somehow points to the reality of the God who is behind all of this. So sure, for modern readers, this is the kind of stuff that causes you to space out when you're reading through the Bible and maybe even get discouraged. You're like, why am I reading this? I don't understand what this list of names is about. But usually if you dig a little bit at this list of names and you ask yourself the question, why would this list of names be included here? What's going on? Then all of a sudden, even though the name still might not really roll off the tongue, it takes that block and it makes it make sense as you're reading through the Bible and these become less discouraging and these lists become less discouraging and exhausting to read. And you realize, man, just the sheer bulk of space that this list of names and that list of names are taken up. This is part of the point. This is part of the message that I am supposed to receive from this. The medium kind of is the message here and the long list is meant to communicate something about the gravity of what was happening here. All right. Good stuff. I'm not sure if you're going to have a list of names, but it's coming from a totally different angle and I think you're going to think it's interesting. We're going to cover a lot of ground tomorrow. I think it will be very fruitful as we get down here toward the homestretch on Nehemiah. All right. That's plenty for now. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
