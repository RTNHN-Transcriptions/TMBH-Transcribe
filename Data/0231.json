We're in Matthew 1023. And so if this is your first time here, most of the Bible is not this hard. It's usually a little bit easier sledding, but today we are going to honor our commitment to go through every single little bit of the entire book of Matthew, including the stuff that I maybe don't know exactly what to do with. So here we go. I'm a lawn guy. I want to train my kids to be lawn kids. I like the act of taking the raw materials of the backyard and cultivating it into something better. And most of the time my kids are all over it. They're like, yeah, we love working on the yard. That's fun. That's fine. We'll get it done. And they go right out and do it. But they are kids, so sometimes they're not in the mood and it takes a little bit of prompting. And when that happens, I do this dad technique where I nebulously describe the future and the order of events to just motivate them to get after it and go something like this. Yeah, I'll be out in a little bit. You guys get started on the lawn and work on it. And you won't be done before I check in. I'll keep an eye on it. I'll be there, whatever. Just you get started on the lawn and then it needs to be done this week today. So just get after it. And they're confused, but it's an intentional confusion because I don't want them focused on when I'm going to come out as the reliever and fix this part of the lawn or that part of the lawn or supervisor, give them approval. I just want them to go take initiative and get after it. And I think that might be what is causing the confusion in Matthew 10, 23. But it also might not be. Let's just break it down together. Here we're at the end of the first half of the missional discourse in Matthew chapter 10, where Jesus is sending the disciples out on a big open world quest, their first big open world quest. They're equipped with the message. The kingdom of heaven is near there, equipped with the ability to do some supernatural stuff that should get people's attention. And much like my pep talk to my daughter that we talked about a couple episodes back before tennis match, where I encourage her both in what's going to happen in this match in near future matches and long term in her relationship with tennis. So also we get three parts to this speech where Jesus is like, Hey, this is what it's going to be like in the right now as you guys go out on this particular little quest regionally. Here's what it's going to be like in the medium term future stuff might get a little bit tricky. Be ready for that. You might hurt a little bit. And then here's what it's going to be like in the grand scheme of people going out and talking about me. It's going to get nuts. People are going to do crazy things. It might even get violent. You just got to expect this stuff. It won't be a surprise when it happens. And also you have to be prepared to endure because from the beginning, as Jesus has been talking about this kingdom thing, he's been turning over his cards. He's been disclosing. He's not been sweetening the deal to try to pitch people on signing up and then doing the old bait and switch. And he's like, Ha ha surprise. You're actually getting flogged. No, no, no. He led with the flogging. In fact, the values of the kingdom that he's inviting people to at the beginning of the sermon on the mount, the beatitudes that is include the language. In fact, the most language about persecution. This is going to happen. And so again, in the second great discourse of Matthew here in verse 22, he says, all men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. Clearly, he doesn't mean all men in a totally literal sense. He's clearly using an expression here to describe this is something you're going to run into a lot because already not all men have hated the disciples because of Jesus. Some people have been really excited about Jesus. So employees, this turn of a phrase, and then we get into the really difficult part. When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Okay. I lied. It's really easy. That's in keeping with what he said earlier in this commissioning. Yeah, go to a town. They're cool. They hang around. You go to a town. They're not cool. Dust off the sandals. You don't have to do anything to them. Just move on. So we've already covered that. Now we get to the hard part. I tell you the truth. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the son of man comes. That feels like a very specific prediction, a very specific timeline. Like now we've gone from talking about three phases to your journey, your task, your lawnmowing job to something with much higher stakes. This looks like we're talking about the end of time, the reckoning, the arrival and full manifestation of the kingdom and the son of man and the moment at which all of the valleys are made low and the no wait, no, it's the other way. The mountains made low valleys. So you know what I'm talking about? Everything getting fixed. Well, the problem though is that the timeline doesn't work with the most obvious reading. I tell you the truth. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the son of man comes. It sounds like Jesus would be talking about the mission trip they're on right now. And no thing really happened at the end of that mission trip where you could be like, ah, that is the son of man coming and glory and force or the kingdom becoming evident to everybody in keeping with the language in Daniel seven, three that Jesus is drawing on when he calls himself the son of man. So what gives? Okay, as best as I can tell, you got two moving parts in this prediction, this phrase. One is you will not finish going through the cities of Israel. What does that mean? And the second is what does the coming of the son of man mean? So let's start with the first one. Possibility number one is that you will not finish going through the cities of Israel means the little local towns right around there in which case, well, we know at the beginning of chapter 11 that they did finish with this. They got done. They got their instructions. They went out. They preached in the towns of Galilee. And then the next thing happened. So I suppose that's one possibility, but it creates problems. Second possibility is what's meant by you will not finish going through the cities of Israel is something much larger. All of Galilee, all of Judea, what the original audience would have thought of as the Jewish ethnic homeland. But a third possibility, and I think the more likely one in terms of how the original audience would have understood it is that we're talking about everywhere where Jewish people are. I don't know this for sure, but I have to think that either the second or third most Jewish city in the entire world at this point in history would have included Susa, Persepolis, Babylon for sure, probably Alexandria. Maybe they had a larger Jewish population than Jerusalem. I don't think so, but I don't know. The point is there's this concept of the diaspora, the scattering of the Jewish people that happened as a result of the Assyrian conquest in the 8th century, the Babylonian conquest in the 6th century, the Persian defeat and conquest over the Babylonians that came shortly thereafter, the Jewish repopulation of Jerusalem, Alexander's invasion, bloodless invasion that resulted in Jewish and Greek cultures being mingled in this big Jewish center happening in northern Egypt. Jewish people are all over the place now. Jewish culture and religion are all over the place now. So does it mean that we need to go to all of those places before it's done? I'm not arguing for one of these three interpretations of not finished going through the cities of Israel. I'm saying they're all possible reads the original audience might have envisioned upon hearing this phrase, which means this is really a difficult passage to sort out. People since then have argued that all the cities of Israel means the whole world. There's no way the original audience would have taken it that way. Such a view requires subscription to a couple of very complex, much later in history views of time and the end times that no one in the original audience would have had in view. And frankly, the idea that the world is Israel is absolutely unsquareable for me with everything that I'm seeing in Matthew. He clearly did not conceive of it that way. And so even though that might fit into some people's red thumbtacks and yarn, crazy wall conspiracy theory ideas, I just cannot give that one any credibility. So I think what you have are three pretty viable options. All the more regional towns of Israel or all of the centers of Jewish culture that we're out and about. But ultimately, none of that matters if we can't sort through the second part before the son of man comes. What does that mean? Does it mean when the son of man catches up with you while you guys are out talking to these people in these local towns around here? Because it could mean that in which case the passage is just like, hey, go out and get after the lawn and I'll catch up with you in a minute. I'll be out there and we'll just get started. Just be motivated and get on the thing. Don't worry about where I'm standing or what I'm doing. I will be there and it'll be great. It feels like Jesus is doing something more weighty than that. That's probably the simplest explanation for the meaning of before the son of man comes. It's probably the simplest explanation for what the passage in general means. But other people have proposed that the coming of the son of man means the crucifixion and resurrection. Other people have argued that the coming of the son of man means the destruction of the temple in 70 AD at the hands of the Romans. To me, this one feels like a stretch though I've read some very intelligent people who are absolutely convinced that is the only way to read it. And then of course you have other people who would just say Jesus was wrong. He thought that there was going to be some kind of God event that was going to occur while the disciples were out on this little mission trip and it didn't occur. And so he had to adjust their expectations later. What I can say is this, if you're waiting for the end of this episode to get to the part where I'm like, ah, I made attention, but it was fake tension. And now here's the actual answer. So you can all feel better. You're going to have to keep waiting because I don't know. And I am committed in our relationship, in our conversation to admitting that I don't know when I don't know. And I don't know on this one. I've put a ton of time and thought into this. I have tried to bounce through the rest of the stuff in Matthew where Jesus talks about future things and how that works. That causes me to be more skeptical of a couple of these positions. And so after looking at all of Jesus' words about future stuff for me and really just for me, I think I'm in a place where the most compelling interpretation of this is simply to say Jesus isn't adding more data to the equation of how all of time is going to play out. I think I may be lean toward the lawnwork analogy. You guys, the point is stay motivated, get after it. Don't worry about when you're done with the thing. I'll catch up and we'll work that out. This is like a 30% level certainty for me though. I really just don't know. What I do know is this, how you interpret this passage affects very, very little about how you interpret the rest of Matthew. Unless you arrive at some very difficult to defend interpretation of this and you're like, I'm sure of that. It's positive. And now I'm going to make the rest of Matthew and the Bible square with my read on Matthew 1023. That is the only way I think we really screw this thing up. That's dangerous. That's going to take us to weird places. That's going to cause us to make an overwrought, overly complicated systematic structure of how time works and how God works with time and how everything has to be. And it's going to screw up the way we read the rest of the text and what we're going for with this thing that we're doing together is a pretty clean read. We can't ultimately divorce it from my assumptions and background no matter how much I might try to because I have biases and I just have the one brain and I'm going to miss stuff. But I don't want to get in the habit of saying, I feel such tension over this verse that I have to come up with an interpretation to make that tension go away. And then I have to make everything else square with that thing so I don't embarrass myself in front of you. I would rather just embarrass myself in front of you and say, I don't know. It's a hard one. People way smarter than me have said that it's a hard one too. And I'm content to have the takeaway here be that Jesus is saying, hey, get after it. Get cracking. There's stuff that needs to be done. Don't worry about what my timeline is. You need to go out and represent the kingdom right now because people need to be a part of the kingdom because this is true and it's real and it matters. Interested in your thoughts on this one, I'll try to buzz around the subreddit a little bit to see where you're coming from on it.
