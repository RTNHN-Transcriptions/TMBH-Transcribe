It's fast, fun, free, daily, deep-dye Bible. And right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here, or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy to use format at thetmbh.com. There's a show that came out a few years back. It was a huge hit. It was the first, I think, big hit from Apple's streaming service. It was called Ted Lasso. And it featured Jason Sudeikis. He was a comedic actor from SNL while he still is a talented guy, funny guy. And Ted Lasso was just great. He was a breath of fresh air and a pretty bleak, dark, brooding era of streaming television. Because Ted Lasso, the whole point of the show, is this guy is an outsider and optimism is going to be his defining trait. He's trying to be somebody who believes the best about people and brings his sort of optimistic Midwestern American football coach demeanor to go and coach soccer or as they call it their football in the UK and as a show that appealed really broadly to a whole bunch of people. And I enjoyed it. It was my favorite show of all time, but I really appreciated Ted Lasso. A lot of cool things about it. Here's one thing I didn't appreciate about it. The Christmas episode and I think it was season two. To me, I will always feel like that episode was just shoehorned in for contractual reasons that had nothing to do with the plot. It seemed like it was shot after the fact is like a cast reunion, but you can't do a cast reunion Christmas special when you're only one and a half seasons into your show. It just felt weird and I came away going, why is this in here? I don't understand why this episode exists. I'm going to contrast that with some of the greatest episodes in the history of television I've ever seen. And I can tell you exactly why they are there and what they contribute to the plot. Here's what I'm driving at though. We just finished this season on Nehemiah and I think a really reasonable question to ask is why is this book in the Bible in season one of this podcast. We did the book of Matthew is 800 episodes long and it was abundantly obvious to all of us whether you're somebody who thinks there's a God or not or has been around Christianity or not. You can still tell why it's in there. Jesus is the son of God and he's born and he comes and he lives his life and he teaches all this stuff and he runs afoul of the religious leaders, religious leaders who were descended from many of their religious leaders and things that are going on in Nehemiah. And they ultimately end up killing him and then he comes back to life and he commissions his disciples to go and make the church. You can tell it has to be in there. It's really easy. There's a wise Genesis in there. Well, this is the beginning of all the things. It's easy to tell why Genesis is in there. Wise revelation, the last book of the Bible in the Bible. Well, it wraps up the whole Bible. It summarizes all of the things that happened theologically. It pays off all of the loose ends and the whole Bible. But Nehemiah understandably could be a little trickier. I could understand how somebody could look at this. Maybe even some of you, if you're feeling a little bit of Old Testament fatigue right now, could look at this and be like, I don't know, get me to Jesus. Do we really need that much Old Testament to spell out all of the problem? Okay, I could get that. But today I want to make my case for why Nehemiah is not the season two Christmas special from Ted Lasso and why even if understandably you are a little worn out from a whole lot of time in Ezra Nehemiah and Esther in this ancient achaemenid period. And even if you are itching to get back to the New Testament as I am as well, I want to make the case for why you should be super happy that you now have this book of the Bible in your hip pocket and I now have it in my hip pocket. And I think the best way to do that is to make a case for why this is in the Bible and why it's important. One, narratively, it does something that had to be done or we would have felt unsatisfied coming out of the Old Testament. As I watch sports seasons and my team has got all of these great players, but they can't all get on the field at the same time. They're all hurt at the wrong moment. And things are just snakebit and it never works out. And I get to the end of the season and they lose and they're done. And I think, okay, well, maybe that wasn't a championship caliber team, but I just wanted to see them take one good run where they had everything working and we could see what they could do with the players and the roster and the coaches that they had. And I never got to see it. And that feels unsatisfying. I think if Nehemiah doesn't exist, the attentive Old Testament reader is going to feel like I still don't know if this could work or not this Old Testament approach to solving the human problem because I never got to see it really put together. I wanted to see a book where a dynamic, powerful, influential leader with all the money he needed and with the backing of the king and there's no military threat or anything could just come along and enforce all the stuff, make all the things that need to happen happen. Don't ask people to do the right thing. Make them do the right thing. If they have an excuse and they're like, well, we could, but we don't have this or we don't have that fine. I'll build you the things. I think the discerning reader of the Old Testament would be very unsatisfied if they didn't get to see a dynamic, powerful leader with basically no human limitations and basically access to all the resources he needs have a shot at pulling everybody together and pulling out all the stops and taking all the lessons of the Old Testament and being like, let's get it right once. Let's put our best product on the field because Nehemiah exists. The thorough reader of the Old Testament can now say, all right, I can move on in peace. I've seen it. That was the best possible run. There were no injured players here. Everything was firing on all cylinders. That was the very best we could do and it wasn't close to good enough. We're going to have to go back to the drawing board and reimagine this whole thing. Nehemiah is so important in satisfying that curiosity in showing that to the attentive reader at the end of the Old Testament. The second reason that this is in the Bible would be all the themes that we talked about in yesterday's episode. If you haven't caught that one, go catch it. I'm not going to speak specifically to any of them again, but I will quickly list them out. The themes of remembrance, providence, opportunism, being set apart, responding to enemies rightly, not answering prayer and worship being at the hub. These are really important biblical themes that have tendrils that spread out into all the other parts of the Bible and are absolutely cohesive with the other parts of the Bible. There's some other ancient literature written from a Jewish perspective that in and of itself is really good. It's why it's cherished literature, but it isn't always cohesive with all the themes and the way it plays out through the rest of the Bible. The book of Nehemiah and the book of Ezra, these are a third reason that I think Nehemiah is in the Bible and that I think you should be really proud of having this book in your hip pocket is it helps you understand the world today. Judaism is amazing. The fact that there are still Jews is amazing. Think about all the people groups that you see around the world today. So many interesting people with so many interesting histories and cultures and communities, but the Jewish people, dang, that really stands out. Whether you agree with all of the politics of the modern nation of Israel or not, it is incredible that you've got a clear provenance of a people group that goes back 4000 plus years and they've preserved their written documents. Even if you don't think there's a God, that is amazing, fascinating. So even if one were to read Nehemiah and reject all the theological implications, it's still just so dang interesting to see a people group who still exists today and to observe this pivotal chapter in their evolution as a people, their growth as a people, their survival as a people from 2500 years ago. If you were paying attention while we went through Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther and thinking about the events unfolding in the world when you listened to this, you made connections and you were able to understand that things going on right now are a continuation of the story we just spent all this time on in Nehemiah. It ain't new. And the stuff that happened in Jesus' time wasn't new. People are dynamic. Cultures are dynamic. Everybody's compensating for something. Everybody's insecure about something, not just individuals, but people groups. Jesus didn't appear in some generic time where all the people were boring and not dynamic. Jesus came into the world in the fullness of time and the Bible holds him out as having lived a perfect life, given perfect to teaching, dying on the cross and being raised from the dead all against the backdrop of a culture that was born straight out of the stuff that we have been looking at in the book of Nehemiah. And then finally, I guess every single point that I made about why this is in the Bible and why you should care about it and why you should be proud that you finished this and have it in your hip pocket now. I guess I've made this point in each of these supporting points. I'm going to just be a big picture and make it one more time here. What we're getting here is a meaningful, important chapter in God's ongoing relationship, not just with his chosen people, the Old Testament, the Jewish people, but with humanity in general. And in that, we're getting an excellent case study, a pinch-zoomed, very detailed case study of what it looks like for the providence and superintendents of God to sit right over the top of history that we imagine to be truly secular in just about the machinations of men. A book like Nehemiah is saying, no, it's not. Of course, there are human machinations behind history, but there's something bigger. There's an order to this isn't just this out of control downstream current of events happening and people being born doing stuff and then dying and then more things happening. There's some bigger overarching story to this thing, even when the human expression of the story doesn't follow the exact plot beats we might like, even when all the resolutions aren't totally satisfying, that tension is there for a reason. And this is my final point for why this is in the Bible. That tension is meant to be pregnant at the end of the Old Testament. You're supposed to come away from this feeling a little discouraged and overwhelmed that every single human solution to the problem of death and suffering and human failure and pride, all the things that affect us as humans, you're supposed to be discouraged that every solution that you could have dreamt up or that I could have dreamt up has now been tested repeatedly and has failed. This is the best run we took at making this better and it didn't take. It didn't work. So we're going to need something better. We're going to need a righteousness apart from the law. We're going to need some sort of blanket amnesty, some sort of mechanism for atonement, for forgiveness from someone bigger than a human, bigger than a king. If this is going to get fixed, if there is to be redemption in this story, coming out of Nehemiah, you as the reader are supposed to be thinking, it's just going to have to come from God on high. And I don't know exactly how he's going to pull it off or what it's going to look like, but that's the only way this story ends well. I think you and I really have invested our time in something valuable here. And I do think you and I have leveled up in a meaningful way by getting the book of Nehemiah in our hip pocket. Again, I would be so incredibly grateful if you would consider jumping in with me for our next season on the book of Galatians, maybe even inviting somebody to do it with you. Maybe it could even be the kind of thing where the two of you or a group of you get together and have a standing weekly conversation about what we look at together as we seek to get the book of Galatians in our hip pocket. All right, that's plenty for now. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
