And right now, we're going through Esther. There's a delightful lady named Sharon who looked me up on the Twitter's over the weekend. She said to me in so many words, big-time paraphrases mine here, these timelines are confusing. It feels like the stories jump around. Could you clarify how all of this fits together for me? And I got to thinking, you know what, Sharon? That is a dang reasonable question and I would be delighted to clarify how all of this stuff that we are covering fits together because Esther is going to work way better. And I would submit to you that the whole opposition to Jesus thing is going to make way more sense when we go back and look at the New Testament again someday. If we understand this very dynamic moment in history that runs from 605 BC up till the end of the Old Testament in the mid 400s BC, I know not everybody's history person and that can feel a little bit overwhelming, but this is totally doable. You don't got to have every day. You don't got to have every name. But if you get to a place where you can feel the story, Esther is going to hit so much harder. And again, I would argue the New Testament is going to hit so much harder as well. Here is the lightning version. I'm using my hand to move down a timeline here. It's going to make a ton of sense. 605 BC is the battle of Karkamesh. At this point, only the Southern Kingdom is remaining and Assyria has been the cruel overlord of the Bible world for more than a hundred years at this point. But in 605 BC, they meet their match and Assyria goes into a tailspin and they are replaced by the new Babylonian Empire under the leadership of Nebuchadnezzar. Well, about 20 years after the Battle of Karkamesh, that sees the Babylonians move up the ladder and the Assyrians move way down, Nebuchadnezzar sets his site on Jerusalem and as the prophets predicted, he destroys the temple and takes the Jews away as captives to Babylon, where they live in captivity for roughly the next 50-ish years until Cyrus the Great of Persia as the prophets predicted, rises up, defeats Babylon and establishes the new Persian Empire. And then really just about a year after that happens, he declares that the Jewish captives can go free as the prophets predicted and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. So under the leadership of a direct descendant of David, who would be king if there was still a kingdom named Zerubable, they go back and they start rebuilding. But then in the mid-500s, according to the book of Ezra, which we've been looking at for the last few days, the local enemies of the Jews try to thwart the building program and the thing grinds to a halt for a period of time. A few years later, in 522 BC, Darius the Great replaces the sons of Cyrus the Great, who's now dead, and Darius establishes himself as the new king of Persia and shortly into his reign. He is reminded that this building project was actually commissioned by Cyrus back in Jerusalem and it should be going on. So things fire back up and the temple is completed in the five teens BC. This is amazing news. This is great. Darius does a bunch of other things. He has adventures and wars all around the world, including famously with the Greeks, but he dies in 486 BC and is replaced by his son Xerxes. We think this is the king of the book of Esther. Somewhere around 482 or maybe a little bit on the other side of 480 in the 470s, the events of the book of Esther occur. She becomes queen. She does brave things to save her people. And Xerxes, who has a bunch more fights with the Greeks and has a long and successful reign as well, he reigns until 465, then he dies and is replaced by his son, Arta Xerxes, who reigns from 465 to 425. And that basically takes us up to the end of the Old Testament with Ezra and Nehemiah, the guys who wrote the books that we've been poking around at here for the last couple of weeks. These guys both operate under the reign of Arta Xerxes with Nehemiah, even holding the honored position of being the cupbearer to King Arta Xerxes. And just for fun to round out the story, if we fast forward another hundred plus years after Arta Xerxes, that's when the conquest of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian happens. He defeats Persia and effectively names himself as the last king of Persia before he dies. Then that sets in motion a bunch of historical events that ultimately end up with the Jews briefly having an independent state once again that ends at the hands of the Roman Republic, which quickly becomes the Roman Empire. And then the first emperor of the Roman Empire is Caesar Augustus. And while he's in charge of the world, Jesus of Nazareth is born into this new, very not Persian, very not Greek, but instead very Roman politically dominated world. I say again, my friends, you do not have to be some kind of history wizard to feel the broad strokes of that story. And so hopefully the more we hit that, the more it clarifies. Sharon, thank you for the great question. I hope that little reset proves to be helpful. And further, I think Sharon's question is very timely because Ezra is chronologically weird. It isn't really. I mean, it makes perfect sense chronologically, but it can be a little bit disorienting as you read through it because the first three, just second, the first three chapters are all happening during the reign of Cyrus the Great. The first Persian king we've been talking about here. It's all about the early stages of the rebuilding of the temple in the five thirties under the leadership of Zorubable. But then as we've been talking about, you get into chapter four and we discovered that they're these age old enemies of the Jews who seem nice at first, but the leadership of the Jews who were rebuilding the temple, their read on who these people are and what their motives really were is vindicated. They look harsh at first when they refuse the help of these outsiders who approach them to help rebuild the temple. But then it turns out they were right all along in assessing their motives that these outsiders were not there to help these outsiders were there to sow chaos and make something different of the project than what it was supposed to be. But then if you read ahead in Ezra four, as I'm guessing Sharon from Twitter did, you start to run into some confusing timeline stuff that can be really disorienting because it looks like in chapter four, we jump forward into the reign of Darius. Indeed, we do, but then it looks like we jump forward even further real quickly into the reign of his son and successor, Xerxes. And then it looks like we jump forward still in chapter four, even further yet to the reign of artists, Xerxes. Well, what they were jumping forward like 80 plus years in history, just in a few sentences and it's very disorienting. That would be like you reading a book that is orienting itself historically by using American presidents. And it's like, well, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in power during World War two, somebody wrote a letter and then they also wrote a letter to Ronald Reagan. And then right after that, they also wrote a letter to Barack Obama. But anyways, about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, well, I mean, that's confusing, right? There's a rapid jump in time. And Ezra four can be a little bit disorienting in that way. But as we're going to look closer at it tomorrow, what we discover is that Ezra is assuming a certain nimbleness with Persian history. And what he's doing here in the middle of Ezra chapter four is he's giving us a historical aside that jumps forward in time to the years when he was alive, because Ezra was a contemporary of art Xerxes in the mid four hundreds. And here in the beginning of the book of Ezra, he's writing about things that happened way before his lifetime, a generation or two earlier way back during the reign of Cyrus the Great. So what Ezra is doing in chapter four is he's doing a little historical aside and demonstrating historical continuity. They're like, Oh, these forces were at work. These challenges were at work jumping all the way forward into the time, even of my lifetime. And then he gets done with that little aside, throws a closed parentheses on it and jumps back into the narrative in the process of getting the temple rebuilt in the first place back in the five hundreds. Maybe that last part was more confusing than helpful, but tomorrow as we track forward in the narrative of Ezra. And really, I think we've only got a couple days left in Ezra. So we're going to make some big progress tomorrow and the next day. I think as we get back into that, you will track with the historical narrative timeline device that Ezra is employing. And we should come out of this really clear on that timeline. Instead of a little bit muddy on that timeline. So Sharon, you are my internet hero of the weekend. That is a great question. Thank you for asking a question. I bet a lot of people were asking. And tomorrow we'll pick it back up looking at this bizarre historical road rage incident where for 60 70 80 years, the enemies of the Jews opposed them aggressively with every single new king who comes along. And I think those will be fun stories as well. I love the fact, my friends, that we are studying a book that we can cross reference with history, real people, real places, real times. It makes the story come to life because of the story is alive, because the story did happen in these environments. And the work we're putting in now will not come back empty for us. We're going to get a lot out of this moving forward. I'm grateful to you for being up to it. I love doing this historical context stuff with you. I hope you're feeling more conversant with Persia stuff every single day back to Ezra. I'm on Yana. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
