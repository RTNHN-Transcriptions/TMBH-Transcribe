And yesterday we started talking about a conundrum, a Bible problem. I don't actually think as much of a Bible problem, but it seemed like a big Bible problem when there was less data about the Persian Empire and more confusion about who was king and when they were king, about a hundred years ago or 150 years ago in the world of biblical and ancient world scholarship. And because of that confusion, what has trickled down to us is a suggestion that's been passed down from book to book to book without really taking into consideration the new data. There may be there's a timeline problem with Ezra and Nehemiah, wherein we got an overlap. We got two different revivals, one at the end of Ezra, one at the end of Nehemiah that are presented as being separate. But some of the critics of the Bible were looking at this 100 years ago or 50 years ago, and they were like, no, no, no, there's confusion. There's the same revival. And it's all screwed up. Bible's screwed up. I made a mistake here. So we're trying to sort through what actually happened and we're doing names and dates and all of that stuff, picking up from what we were talking about yesterday. There, I think we are now reset and ready to charge forward. I'm going to ask my friend Jeffrey to play some music. And we'll get into this. Okay, let's just go with the text here and break down the timeline of events. The first half of Ezra clearly puts itself during the reign of Cyrus and then during the reign of Darius. Now Xerxes and Artaxerxes get a little flash forward mention in there. But this is all about the time of Cyrus and Darius. So we're talking about the late 500s BC and in it. Okay, in the first year, Cyrus King of Persia. So that tells us this is 539 BC is where Ezra opens. That's how we measure time in the ancient world. What year of the reign of what King? And this is all the business about, you know, go and rebuild the temple. So then in Ezra chapter three, still early on in the reign of Cyrus, rubable and people they go back and they're starting to offer sacrifices again. And then in chapter four of Ezra, the timeline starts to move forward a little bit. And we reach forward into the age of Darius as we get into chapter five. And then into chapter six, Darius is like, all right, we got to finish up that project. That's definitely a thing we want to do. And then it looks like it gets wrapped up in five 15 ish BC. Some people put that in five 18 BC, but we're real close either way. And then at the end of chapter six, that whole era of Ezra is done. And we fast forward way forward. How do I know that? Because Ezra chapter seven says this, after these things during the reign of Artaxerxes, King of Persia. Oh, okay. So that clue at the beginning of Ezra chapter seven tells us we just jumped forward to Kings. We went all the way through the rest of the reign of Darius. We're now all the way past the reign of Xerxes, Darius's son. And we're now into the reign of Artaxerxes, Darius's grand son. Alec, I know this can start to feel overwhelming because the dates count the wrong way in the BC times. And we don't feel the eras of these kings the way we feel eras of leaders in our country. In my country, people can feel the difference between the Reagan era and the Clinton era and the Obama era and the Biden era. You can tell there's all kinds of markers and mental cues to keep you oriented to time. And if somebody brought up something that was from the Kennedy era in my country, but it actually corresponded to the Biden era, it would just be a laughable mistake because it's common knowledge everybody knows and feels this bit of history. You don't know the timeline of the presidents. You feel the timeline of the presidents. We don't feel the timeline of Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, Artaxerxes. We got to focus and think hard about it. And we're talking about a span of time here between these presidencies, if you will, that would be the equivalent of like the Coolidge era all the way to the Biden era. Does anybody even know anything about the Coolidge era? I know that guy didn't do much. He didn't say much. He's my favorite president because he didn't do anything, which I think is rad. Seriously, you become president of everything and you're like, you know what I'm going to do with my power? Nothing. It's bold leadership right there. I like that Calvin Coolidge. So in Ezra chapter seven, there's a huge jump in time that the original audience would feel that you and I don't feel everything so far is checking out perfectly, by the way, with what we now know about the timeline of Persian history. Well, starting in Ezra seven, Artaxerxes is letting Ezra as a priest and a teacher go back and rebuild the people of Jerusalem teaching them their law. And so in chapter eight, Ezra goes on a big long journey. And then in Ezra nine, Ezra gets there and he realizes the people are really screwed up. This is super bad. And as we're nine, he is sad about things. And as we attend, the people see it and they're like, what should we do? And in Ezra 10, as we're like, we should stop being idiots is what we should do. And we should worship God. And also, y'all, you can't just intermarry like that anymore. It isn't going to work. There were different people. Things are different for us around here. And then everybody is like, our bad, let's fix that. That's the book of Ezra. So how do we know when the Ezra stuff happened? Well, it's smoking gun spelled out right here in Ezra seven seven. Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levite, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes. Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the King. That is hyper explicit. And since we know that Xerxes died in 465, and Artaxerxes became king right after that, we know that this must put us in the summer of 458 BC. Again, we got to be charitable to the people who were criticizing this timeline in the 1800s, because their data was wrong. They had a couple of the names of these Persian kings flipped, flopped and screwed up. And they were working off of inaccurate data and trying to reconcile Ezra to inaccurate chronologies when they were working on this in the 1800s. So then from Ezra chapter seven to the end of the book of Ezra, there is no discernible time jump. It never happens. There's never like many, many, many years past. And then people started to do things differently. It's all very quick. In fact, here's one time transitional passage in Ezra 10. Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin, and we get stuff like that throughout it indicating that this is all happening. Really, it pretty breakneck speed that the reforms of Ezra are occurring. So presumably all of that is happening in basically 458 BC. Then there is a huge time jump from the end of Ezra to the beginning of Nehemiah, even though it's telling the same story with mostly the same characters. So Nehemiah one opens with Nehemiah getting worried about what's gone wrong in Jerusalem. And Nehemiah two gives us our next date check in. Here we go. In the month of Nissan in the 20th year of King Artaxerxes. Whoa, wait a minute. In the month of Nissan in the 20th year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. Well, now based on the clearly and well established timeline of the reign of King Artaxerxes, we know that we are in the spring of 444 BC when Nehemiah is about to go into the throne room and try to get permission to go and rebuild the walls. We then get a crystal clear timeline of Nehemiah's journey. Nehemiah getting after the walls, defending Jerusalem against the people who would want to hurt him and then pulling people together at the dedication of the walls through chapter six and chapter seven. And then into chapter eight, we're into September of 444 BC with a clear timeline. And everybody's getting together spontaneously by the Watergate saying, read to us from the book of the law. And Ezra is there. Well, look, in the same way that if I said, people got together in New York at a farm and there was a great big rock festival and everybody got covered in mud and made out with each other and they did drugs. And the music was real loud and people didn't really know what to do with it. But everybody knew it was kind of a societal moment. Well, I could be talking about two things. I could be talking about the first woodstock from the summer of love in the sixties or I could be talking about the ill-fated MTV sponsored Woodstock 99 that did not go well. They happened in the same place. There was mud. People made out a lot. There's nudity and drugs and things like that at both of them. But they mean something very different. And I suppose if enough historical records got lost, people could look at that and be like, okay, well, these are descriptions of just two different aspects of the same music festival, the same summer written from two different perspectives to make two different points. When in fact, the reality is that would be a false assessment of a description of the original Woodstock and Woodstock 99. And it would really only take a little more historical data to come to light for people to then say, oh, no, no, no, no, our bad. These were two events that were similar, but were separated by really quite a bit of time. But then when that data came to light, people knew it was separated by 30 years, they might still say, okay, these are separate events, but they are part of the same cultural movement, free love, rock music, drugs, youth culture, all of that stuff that dominated Western culture from the 1960s till when everything's changed and they end. That is exactly what we see happening here with how people have treated these two passages. Clearly, the latter part of the book of Ezra is dealing with the events of four 58 BC and the beginnings of a religious revival and a cultural movement and overhaul that, yes, flared up spontaneously late in the book of Ezra, but would take decades to fully carry out and implement and integrate into society. Also clearly, 14 years then pass as we get into the second half of Nehemiah. And what was started in the book of Ezra is still going on as cultural movement is occurring. It's ebbed and flowed in its popularity and intensity during that time, but building the wall seems to have triggered people solidified something. And now what might have been slightly waning momentum from the original revivals of four 58 BC has gained now more momentum than ever in the fall of four 44 BC 14 years later. And no doubt there's some nostalgia for the people who were there for the first event or like, this is great. This is what needed to happen. It's finally going on. And no doubt there would have been people who were too young to remember the first event who were swept up in this thing that really amounts to basically a 15 year revival that is going to reframe the entire trajectory of how the descendants of Abraham think of themselves, think of their neighbors and do things culturally. This shift that is occurring through Ezra and Nehemiah is not one event that got confused by the author of Ezra and Nehemiah. And it was just described from two different angles. These are two singular separate hotspots punctuation moments in a much larger religious revival and cultural revival that is going to completely change the landscape of a people group that has existed into almost time immemorial according to the rest of the Bible. So to the scholars of your who saw a problem here with the limited data set they were working off of back then, no hard feelings. Why would you not ask these questions? Those are totally reasonable questions. To those of you who are listening to this in the right here and the right now, we have the historical data that we need to look at this and say, okay, we have a clear picture historically of what this is when these things happened and how it's playing out. This also means then that what we're getting from Nehemiah 9 to the end of the book of Nehemiah really is the spike of the football. It is the finishing. It is the nailing down. It's a cementing, the solidifying of this big religious movement that has been cooking at this time that we're looking at for 15-ish years. I've enjoyed this. Thank you for always being willing to go down the history rabbit hole with me a little bit here. I was like using that as an excuse to reset the big picture as well. And I think that reset is going to come in handy as we get into this massive prayer of Ezra that is going to dominate the next two pages of text here in Nehemiah 9. All right, that's plenty for now.
