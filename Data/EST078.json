I use them for my cameras. Three of them are nondescript. They're identical. But this other one has my initials on it and a yellow sticker. It's a really fancy one that I use to shoot in 4K without any issues or delays. They feel identical to the touch when you're not looking at them. I've got them all in my hand. I'm just shaking them up right now, very vigorously. They're all getting mixed up. What I'm going to do here in a moment is I'm going to stop shaking. I'm going to not look. I'm going to reach into my hand blindly and pull one out. Now if I get one of the three nondescript cards, we're just going to move ahead with the episode like normal. But if I draw the one with the yellow dot and my initials on it, we're going to begin the episode with me doing a Victorian prose style recitation of every single word of ceramixalots 1992 smash hit, baby got back. All right, it's drawing time. Let's see what half God wrought. Nope, it's boring one. Now for some of you, you might feel like we just dodged a bullet for others of you. That might be a great disappointment, but I made a commitment and in all genuineness, I followed through on that commitment. No games here. I don't know what I would have done if I'd actually drawn the one with that yellow dot. It would have been either an integrity disaster or a programming disaster. Well, no matter, no concern of mine. Here we go. Esther chapter three, verse seven in the 12th year of King Xerxes in the first month, the month of Nissan, they cast the poor, that is the lot in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the 12th month, the month of a dar. So what we're seeing here is this Haman fellow is absolutely sure that he needs to exterminate all of the Jewish people. He's just not sure when. And so he's going to engage in this ancient practice of Cleromancy, the use of some sort of divining item to make a decision, either in correspondence with the gods or a specific god or in consultation with the grand notion of fate. But you'll notice that Haman, he's not getting his hands dirty on this. He's not the one casting the poor. It says they cast the poor. And so if I look back through Esther three here to try to figure out who the they might be and what's the antecedent on that, it looks like the closest one I can come up with here in proximity would be the royal officials who maybe asked Mordecai what the deal was and then went to Haman to ask what the deal was. It's either them or some sort of court magicians or wizards or diviners. And interesting linguistic note here, I guess you could call him any of those things, someone who would cast a lot or cast the poor or consult fate or the deities or the spirits for an answer about what to do. We think that is being the work of wizards or diviners or soothsayers, but at least in the ancient Greek speaking world, such a person was called the English rendering would be a cleric or they would be clergy. It's born out of the Greek word klaryos, which is where we get the English word klaryomancy, which is to consult fate or the gods or whatever, using some sort of items that randomize things to determine whether or not you're going to recite all the lyrics to ceramics a lot's 1992 smash hit, baby got back or not in our case, obviously not. So again, Haman is crystal clear on the we got to kill the Jews thing. He wants to do that. He's not clear on when and I'm not clear on why he's not clear on when. Why do you need to debate this so much? How hard is it? I mean, you're in charge of the calendar. Pick a date on the calendar. Make your pencil tip and just circle something and that'll just be kill the Jews day, I guess. But apparently, Haman views this as a really big deal and something in which he is not guaranteed success and an endeavor so big deserves careful thought and consideration and even the input of the gods or of fate. Yes, he is appealing to some long forgotten Amalekite deity or perhaps he is appealing to a Huramazda, the patron God of the Persians, the one who Darius and Xerxes both inscribed and affirmed that they had power because of your recall. Darius very distinctively said that a Huramazda came to him and gave him guidance and said, there's an imposter. You got to go get rid of that imposter and destroy the lie and to bring light to the situation. So Darius embraced that motif. The art that happened in the architecture and designs around Susa, so much of it features imagery of light and brightness and illumination all meant to be a symbol of truth and truth, not just that is man-made, but that is descended from the great God, the God of light, a Huramazda. So we know from all of these early sources that we've looked at and many that we haven't rotted as TC as Xenophon, that consultations, divination, Cleromancy to use our fancy new word that we're employing here, that all took place to determine big things about what the Persian kings would do. How should we proceed in our battle against the Greeks? Well, let's consult the gods. And it's not just the Persians who did this. We know that everybody in the ancient world did this. We know that, well, people still do this. This is something that has been a technique for getting humans unstuck on decisions big and small for a very, very long time. And of course, there are a lot of different methods for doing this sort of thing. Two of those methods seem to be alluded to right here in Esther chapter three. The month of Nisan is when this happened and then they cast the poor. That is the lot. Well, sometimes you'll see that idea of the poor being likened to a dice, like a role play gamer would use. Is this a 12 sided dice to pick a month? Is it a six sided dice and you kind of narrow it down from there? Or is the better way to understand the technique that Haman and whoever he's working with here used to understand it as more of a casting of lots? Now the casting of lots is where you would take stones or shards of pottery and you draw stuff on there that each corresponds to a different answer and you cast it blindly and draw it blindly. And that narrows down your decision making. We know this practice was going on at this exact moment in history because literally at this exact moment in history, back out West in Greece, we know that the Greek personalities most responsible for winning the war against Xerxes in his invasion, what are we at here six years earlier, have now gained too much political power in Greece. And one of them in particular, the mysticlies has been ostracized by the Athenians. That is the powerful people of Athens. And this is really more of a gesture of democracy in this case, the primitive democracy, but they came together and they were able to write on shards of pottery who they wanted to see cast out of their midst because they're just too politically powerful and somebody just needs to go away for a while. And either what they did there is that everybody got to draw or write a name rather on a shard of pottery and whoever got the most votes was ostracized or what they did as they dumped it all into a big bucket. If somebody got their name written down a lot, they were more likely to be drawn, but still the patron god or goddess rather of Athens. It's Athena. It's right there in the name. Come on. The patron goddess of Athens, Athena would guide the hand of the person who draws it. And even if there were 999 votes for the mysticlies in there, but one pottery shard had some other name on there and that is who Athena ordained, then supposedly they would draw that one out. They were still clear on how that method worked or if it worked the same way every time. What I am crystal clear on is that there was massive cultural exchange between the Greeks and the Persians at this time and not just because of the invasion. Most of the Greek-ish world was a part of the Persian Empire at this point. So Heyman would have known all about those different strategies for casting lots. Would he have employed a strategy that was handed down to him from his Amalekite forebearers if indeed he is an Amalekite maybe would he have used one that was in keeping with the Persian court, the preferred method for consulting the will of a Huramasta maybe would he have used a technique that would have been in keeping with the Greek cultural exchange and the methods of those goofy far western Greek people maybe, but definitely historically almost everybody has understood this to be referring to the casting of a die at least in part. And this word the poor is a very important word because it's the one that's going to lend its name ironically to the celebration to the new festival that gets introduced even as the Jews are still in exile at the end of the book of Esther to celebrate the victory over Heyman that happens here in the deliverance of the Jewish people. Now obviously this kind of game of chance raises a lot of questions and brings a lot of things up about the unseen player in this whole book of Esther that being God. What does he do with games of chance like this and are these people bad not just for obviously wanting to kill the Jews, but also for engaging in this kind of divination this kind of consultation this kind of Claremancy we're going to talk about all of that stuff tomorrow, but before we go we've got my SD cards back over here shaking them up same rules as before normal card we're going to do nothing just wrap up the episode if I pull the SD card with the sticker on it then I am going to ask you to leave a review for this podcast and thank you in advance for it. Alright let's see what we get. Nope that's a boring card I'm not going to ask you to do that. Alright I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon.
