I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Thank you for hanging out with me. I was poking around on the podcast charts this weekend and looking for new stuff to listen to. I'm thumbing through Spotify and I realized, and every time I think I have a sense of how vast the podcast world is, I am humbled when I actually go out into those deep waters and explore. There's just so much stuff. And because of the sheer volume of podcasts, there's bound to be a bunch that are really good. And there are so many that are so good with such talented people making really insightful content. And then I get to the microphone here to record stuff for us today. And I'm more reminded than ever, like, dang, you all are sacrificing listening to other stuff with your time to hang out with me and do this. And I just, I really appreciate it. I know you got a billion things you can do with your time. And you working this in and making this a part of the rhythm that we share together is very, very appreciated. Several years ago, I was working at a church and we were working on a name change. That was a fashionable thing to do a while back. And I think the idea there was that a lot of the old Christian terminology while still very viable in terms of what it means, it just doesn't mean much to people who are on the outside looking in and, well, for crying out loud, if you're church and you're not at least trying to think about how you come off to people around the outside looking in, you're probably missing the point. But you know, things were real pretty well there. We were talking anyway about maybe it's time to rename this thing in a way that will make it make more sense to the world. And a lot of the ideas that initially got thrown out in our brainstorming session were pretty typical of how churches were rebranding in those days. There's effectively the same naming and branding strategy that housing developments in nice neighborhoods would go with. You pick a geographic feature and maybe an animal would fit in there in maybe some kind of ambiguous verb. And you just lump a combination of those things together. I mean, really, you could just throw them all in a hat and pull two out, try them in one order and then the other. And you probably got your name figured out. And so, of course, right off the bat, the suggestions are things like Eagle Run, Pebble Brook, Copperstone, all sounds like golf courses and stuff. And so I don't know, I was feeling snarky and I felt like I wanted to make fun of that a little bit. And I felt like I had the rapport in the room with my friends and my colleagues to jab at this silly little church naming trend. And so following the same structure, I proposed Milstone Harbor and it got real quiet. And I really thought everybody would laugh and nobody laughed because I was picturing this passage that we're talking about right now. And the joke wasn't like you all are bad and dumb. The joke was just like, ha, ha, wouldn't that be a terrible stupid name because of the part in the Bible where it says that if you mislead people, you might as well just put a Milstone around neck and jump into it like anybody, nobody, nobody. And so I hung my head in shame. And I did get talked to afterwards, but the talking to was very respectful. And I tried to behave better in the future. All of that to say, we are looking at the passage where that comes up today. And it is oft forgotten, I think, that that stern warning comes right on the backside of this really paternal, friendly, warm, fatherly, cherished moment affirmation of the heart of a child thing that we get from Jesus. So we're in Matthew chapter 18 and chapter 17. We're coming off of Peter's confession of Christ. Jesus says, I'm going to go die. Peter's like, no, and Jesus is like, get behind me Satan. That is totally happening. Whether you squawk about it or not, Peter. And then Jesus takes three of the inner circle of disciples up on to the mount of transfiguration. They didn't call it that thing because there hadn't been a transfiguration yet. But later people maybe would call it that and they go up there and Jesus shines like the sun and they see him in some of his transcendent glory and they hang out with some of the rock star legends of the religious past. And then they come back down the mountain and they process what it all means. And Jesus is immediately moved from the realm of the transcendent right back into the realm of the mundane as people need miracles and stuff. And it just becomes evident narratively. The needs are never going to go away. It isn't physically possible on a human timeline, one person at a time for Jesus to go around and just heal the thing and fix the thing. The situation begs for a transcendent solution that gets it all that fixes the whole mess, not just band-aids up the symptoms. And then Jesus moves on from that healing right there back toward his hometown or the town where he's hanging out rather of Capernaum, Peter's hometown and some tax collectors there like, Hey, you guys going to be paying the temple tax? You want to keep up the temple? And Peter's like, Yeah, I think so. And Jesus is like, Yeah, let's pay them. Just, you know, there's no point in picking a fight or offending over this particular point. We got bigger fish to fry here. Not intentional, but my subconscious pun brain just made that happen. And so in light of a fish fry, Agnes Hargness, wink, he then goes on to say, go cast your line in the water and you'll get a fish in the fish. You'll have the coin in there and pay the taxes with the coin. We go straight from there because we get the Matthew transitional queue at the beginning of chapter 18 that says at that time, we've talked about these chronological cues Matthew uses before to tell us whether we're going immediately from one place to the next or if it's vaguely in the neighborhood. Like, that was about the week that this other thing happened at that time indicates we're in close chronological proximity of the temple tax fish incident when the following happens. The disciples come to Jesus and they ask, who's going to be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And then Jesus called a little child and he had him stand among them and he said, I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. But this is where it gets grisly. If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. Well, now obviously, if we were writing a Bible today and if Jesus were communicating to a 21st century audience and that is when this whole thing was going to be initiated, I think there's a chance he would employ different language because Jesus seems to be incredibly savvy about the moment in history and what is going to necessarily push people's buttons and what would be an unnecessary button pushing, see the whole temple tax fish thing that we just looked at. Jesus was to use his own terminology, shrewd as a serpent and innocent as a dove. And that's in the good way. And so what we have here is a two part teaching. Part one is that you want to assume the posture of a little kid, assume a right posture before the king, one that is illustrated as we discussed last time around in the Lord's Prayer. It's one that starts with a posture of dependence, of need, of certainty of the character and the goodwill and the ability of the king to provide or of the parent to provide as the analogy goes. And so this posture of humility is one that the disciples were not assuming. They were worried about what they could get and how they could become greatest. And Jesus in that very typical kingdom values sense flips the whole values on their head. The disciples are operating in world values terms. They're thinking, who gets the most elevated? What do I need to do to get ahead? And Jesus in keeping with the beatitudes, which describe an upside down set of values from the world kingdom that exist in the actual kingdom kingdom. He's like, Nah, first, his last least is greatest. It works like that. This is another riff on that motif. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And further, he says, you're not getting in unless you assume this posture. The whole question here of salvation really does come into play because Jesus is explicitly saying you will never enter the kingdom of heaven unless you become like this little child. Well, okay, you got that proper posture before the king. You've got that right orientation, that right mindset. But also, you've got the mindset of I cannot save myself. I cannot deliver myself if you are assuming this right posture. So in the same way that Jesus in Matthew chapter five says, well, I guess you're righteousness would have to exceed that of the Pharisees, that the teachers of the law, if you wanted to get into the kingdom. What he's saying is that isn't possible. Nobody can do better than what they're doing, especially because they get to write their own laws and gerrymander them around their preexisting behavior. Nobody can exceed them. Those are the most righteous people of all. So what Jesus is hinting at is this idea that there is a righteousness apart from the law, a righteousness that is from God, and we get that payoff later in the text, and that this righteousness imparted from God to people we will learn later by the work of Christ on the cross and in the resurrection. This is how people are right before God. This is how people gain that right standing, not through the most rigorous exemplary behavior ever. And the way the gospel plays out and Jesus teachings play out are such that you're supposed to come away with the distinct impression that all of your good deeds and self focused, good behavior to demonstrate how worthy of the kingdom you are to God. It actually it's pride and it has the opposite effect. The right posture before the king is not one of pride that says, look at what I achieved for you, king, you got to let me in now to your kingdom and make me part of your family of faith. You have to make me a son, a daughter, a child, an heir, because I did all of this stuff and didn't do any bad stuff. No, it's quite the opposite. The right posture before the king is again one of humility that says, I come to you in a gesture of trust of your character and your grace and your forgiveness and your patience and your eagerness to provide and to rule benevolently. And I know that if I am to become a son, a daughter, a child, an heir of the king, if I am to gain admission to this kingdom, it is only by your mercy and by your character that such a thing can happen. I mean, really the same way a kid in a healthy household depends on their parent or their guardian. And so then Jesus goes on to the second teaching and that is what it looks like for someone to respond to one of these little children, one of these vulnerable little ones who has assumed this right posture. What does it look like to respond to that person in that vulnerable place in the name of the king if you're already in the kingdom? Because you're going to be representing the king in some way. And there's a right way and a wrong way apparently to respond to that. And that's where we're going to get into the whole millstone thing. And the hilarious joke this should have totally slayed in that setting in that meeting all those years ago, but still, for some reason, inexplicably did not we're going to get into that whole thing about the millstone and the warning and anytime. Obviously, we get into the stern language from Jesus. It makes us think real hard because it's kind of freaky and we're not used to that version of Jesus. So we got some stuff to think about there. In the meantime, hey, those of you who have been here from the very beginning or who have powered through to catch up, I have a very heartfelt high five that I would like to give to you right now. Behold, is your hand up? It has to be up. Thank you. Okay. Now they all are ready. Go. Internet high five, 400 episodes. Are you kidding me? Did we really actually just do that? Did we get through 17 full chapters and a little bit of 18 over the course of 410 to 14 minute episodes? Just think about what you just invested in that. Think about the amount of time that you and I have thrown at this together to really get a book of the Bible, one that happens to be about the main character of the Bible, to really get that book in our hip pockets. And that is so much what I want us to all come away from this feeling like. I do not need you to come away from this exercise feeling like, oh, well, he convinced me. Now, I think all the things Matt thinks about Christianity. And now I can have exactly his theology, which is the one truth. Theology, I'm not doing that game. It's the internet. That's not how things work. What I do want to do is get to a place where with eyes wide open, regardless of our backgrounds or where we're coming from or where we land, we looked at this thing very, very honestly together and did our best to understand it as best as we can. And we are 400 episodes into that. You are awesome. Thank you for doing this with me. I also need to tell you more tomorrow about how we're going to land the plane on the 400th episode Easter egg musical competition thing. More details on that. Magna. I've already gone on too long. We'll pick it up right where we left off next time around. I'm Matt is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Thanks again for being how you are.
