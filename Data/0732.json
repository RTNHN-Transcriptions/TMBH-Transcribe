And we get this scene that's been playing on a loop for us here for the last few days from Matthew. And it's a grisly scene. Jesus who did everything right and helped people and taught things that were true and stood up to institutions and corrupt politicians and twisted up fake religiosity who took care of the needs of the outsiders and the marginalized and who spanned the seemingly unspanable boundaries that existed culturally between different groups. That Jesus, he's been flogged his back looks like hamburgers ripped to shreds. He's bleeding. He's losing strength. And he's on his way to be crucified. But in the meantime, a bunch of jackals, a bunch of hyenas that is a bunch of Roman executioners whose job it is to yuck it up for the crowd so that they can both set an example of what happens if you resist the government, but also give the people some spectacle and some fun to keep them entertained. So they won't have time to revolt and do things they don't like. These guys are doing one of those medieval Jean-Gluor Jape kind of routines where they got some puppets with sticks and they move them around and they whack people on the head and they make fun of the fake king and do some mockery maybe right before an execution. It's that kind of ridiculous mocking scene that we get here as these guys strip Jesus and put a scarlet robe on him. They twist together a crown of thorns and set it on his head as they put a staff in his right hand and they kneel in front of him and they mock him saying, Hey, old king of the Jews, that's the scene we've been stuck on because it's the scene that looks like the point of no return. It looks like we've seen absolute defeat and it was a fun ride with Jesus. Indeed, if he was a normal human character, this is the point where we start making plans for what we do after Jesus because that is usually the end of things. But there's this recurring theme throughout the Bible where every time it seems like evil is getting a leg up or the plans of God to redeem or being thwarted. He's just wait a second and you realize, no, God is being presented as the sovereign of everything. And this is exactly how it was supposed to go down because there's some bigger point that's being made. So in this case, all right, well, look, I mean, I think probably most of you know, whether you're Christians or not, that he comes back to life after he gets killed here. And like a page or so. So knowing then that we've got that reversal of fortune coming up, what is the bigger point of having people kneel in front of him and mock him? Well, we've already looked at the ways that directly fulfills scripture that Jesus said that's exactly the kind of behavior that would happen. We've already looked at how that's a payoff for the very first things Jesus says publicly about the values of the kingdom in Matthew chapter five and the sermon on the mount where he concludes with those remarks about blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me, rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. So we've talked about the symmetry there and what's going on thematically there, but there's an even bigger thing going on thematically here as these goons rip up Jesus and make fun of him in front of this crowd that at least partially is delighted by the whole thing. Their kneeling actually points to a biblical theme that is very, very pronounced all the way back in Genesis 12. God makes a deal with Abraham out of the clear blue sky. He didn't do anything. Abraham wasn't more impressive. He was Abraham, then he became Abraham. That's why I'm using the names a little bit interchangeably here. And for whatever reason, God's like that guy, you're going to be the guy. I pick you and then he makes a deal with Abraham and Abraham doesn't even have to do anything for this deal to work out. The terms are as such, God says, I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you. I will make your name great and you'll be a blessing. I'll bless those who bless you and over curses you all curse and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you. There's a lot of open-endedness there, but that's very, very positive. Well, as the Old Testament unfolds, that open-endedness becomes more clear. Eventually, the descendants of Abraham demand a monarchy and they get one and their first monarch is middling at best. He demonstrates that moving from God as king to some guy as king, like the rest of the world does it, is not an upgrade. And now we're stuck with this monarchy yet in 2 Samuel 7, speaking to the guy who would be the second king of Israel, we get a sense of how that promise to Abraham way back from Genesis 12 is going to work out. It's going to work out in the form of the kingdom with a king who's going to be a good king, some kind of restoration of the idea, the acknowledgement of God as being the true king of these people. The Lord declares to you, as God talking to David, that the Lord himself will establish a house for you. And your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you who will come from your own body and I will establish his kingdom. Now here, we're simultaneously talking about Solomon and Jesus. He is the one who will build a house for my name. Literally Solomon is going to build the physical first temple. Jesus spiritually, fulfillment-wise, metaphorically, he's going to Matthew 5 17 style complete that notion by building a new family of faith, a new house. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. Aha. So this promise to Abraham is going to be fulfilled through a kingdom. This promise to redeem and bless all the nations is going to come through a kingdom. As we work through the rest of the Old Testament, we get into big prophets and little prophets. We see them all pointing to this idea, the weather they're writing in a time when the kingdom is really thriving or the kingdom is split in half and falling apart. Whatever the circumstances, there's always this sense that God is not done with this promise and that even if there's the slightest little stick coming up out of the ground with the slightest little bit of green showing on it, that is still enough for God to grow it up into this great big gigantic tree that will become representative of this kingdom and this flourishing set of kingdom values overseen by this great and eternal king. And one of the historical characters of the book of Isaiah uses to set the stage for what this great king, what this Messiah is going to be like is a known historical character, the first emperor of Persia, Cyrus the Great. Isaiah 45 is an oft discussed passage that involves God uniquely describing that he's going to speak favorably of Cyrus, that Cyrus is going to be an instrument in his hand who he's going to use to accomplish righteous things. And then God goes on to talk about just in general people's orientation toward him toward the Lord. And in verse 23 says by myself, I have sworn my mouth has uttered in all integrity, a word that will not be revoked before me every knee will bow by me every tongue will swear. They will say of me and the Lord alone are righteousness and strength. All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame, but in the Lord, all the descendants of Israel will be found righteous and will exalt. So coming out of the Old Testament, there is this idea that this great king is coming, but not just that all of Israel will finally be unified in seeing what is true and real and good, not just that Israel will live out the values of the kingdom, but that every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to confess. We're going to get that vindication. We're going to get that moment where everybody has to admit, dang, this is the truest, realist thing. Everything else in the world is just going to be this open ended, never resolved, oft memory hold set of ideas that just roll downstream and over the historical thought waterfall. And you're just not getting satisfaction on that. Truth goes through the ringer, but not according to the Bible on this point, on this point, every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess you will have agreement on it. Matthew 25 has Jesus alluding to that stuff when he talks about the overt part of the signs of the end of the age. Remember the disciples were like, Hey, so how exactly is this all going to work out? Tell us this is back in 24. They ask the question, when will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age? Remember Jesus breaks it down. He's like, right? There's going to be a bunch of stuff that's not necessarily the first thing to see. You know, you don't need to freak out about that, just like be alert and be eyes up. And then there's going to be a very noticeable thing that's going to happen. And then he gets into verse 29 and he starts to describe unmissable signs at that time. The sign of the son of man will appear in the sky and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the son of man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of the heavens to the other. And there we get the kind of inarguable moment that people look at and say, huh, that's weird. You don't, I just don't see a lot of sky horses. That is abnormal. That's the kind of thing that makes me think that maybe I was wrong about some stuff and maybe whatever the sky horse thing is, maybe that's the thing that is right. But as we work further into the New Testament, that every knee will bow, every tongue will confess reassurance just becomes more pronounced. So then each of us will give an account of himself to God, not just people who believed any of this stuff, not just the people in the crowd who are sad as they watch this beating and mockery of Jesus unfold in Matthew 27. The people doing the beating and the mocking and the fake kneeling, they're going to give an account because every knee will bow and every tongue will confess. That's what the text teaches. Philippians chapter two hits this point one more time on our way out the door today. That is verses 10 and 11, but I can't just read you that because it's a description. There's a beautiful passage here in Philippians two about the humility, the attitude that Christ took on. So I'm just going to read you the whole thing right here starting in verse five. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus. This is the apostle Paul writing by the way. He was a guy who becomes a Christian a little bit after Jesus dies and is resurrected and descends in the book of Acts. He becomes a really big deal in Christianity. And for those of you who are unfamiliar, the second half of the New Testament is made up largely of letters that he wrote articulating Christian stuff to all of these new pockets of Christianity around the Mediterranean world. So your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus who being in very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man. He humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross. Yeah, I should say he humbled himself. According to the text, he has the full capacity to put an end to this clown show at any time, but instead he lets each and every one of those little pieces of lead or glass or bone or rock dig into his back, pull it open for everybody to see. He endures the humiliation of these guys who do not know what they are doing and do not know what they are saying. He takes that in front of everybody. He lets those streams of blood decorate his forehead where gold and jewels should be adorning a crown on his head. And he does so because of an agenda that we've talked about a whole bunch. He's going there voluntarily. Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. These guys bending the knee to Jesus in a way that was meant to make fun of him is actually symbolic of the eternal reality that is going to unfold as God's plan, which cannot be thwarted comes to fruition and this step where Jesus is being publicly shamed and beaten and mocked and humiliated is not a deviation from that plan where something went wrong and it went off the rails for a minute, but then God made a nice save. Rather, it was a part of the plan all along and it serves to be a story beat, a prophetic completion, an idea rhyme that pulls together a jillion ideas about the ultimate subservience of humanity, everybody, all the scoffing, all the mocking, all the everything coming into agreement and humility and bending the knee before the king at some appointed time in the future. Right now it might seem like a joke, but it's not going to be a joke forever. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
