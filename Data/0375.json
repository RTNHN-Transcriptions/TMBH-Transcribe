I would like to think here it's been pretty friendly and pretty interesting and fun as we try to unpack it. And as I do my best to give a fair treatment to what everybody thinks with limited time, thank you in advance for your grace and your patience with me on that. Let's try to unpack the rest of it now. So in regards to this affirmation, this blessing that Jesus pronounces on Peter in verse 17, we would find points of agreement between these two historical positions and we would find a few points of divergence. But in verse 18, you start to see that divergence really ramp up says, and I tell you, that's Jesus, that you are Peter and on this rock, I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. Now I have heard people whose conclusions I end up agreeing with argue that Jesus is not talking about Peter here when he says, and on this rock, I will build my church, that he's talking maybe about Peter's confession or that he's talking about maybe just in general who Jesus is and the stuff Jesus said and did. But I don't agree with their read on that again, acknowledging I could be wrong about a bajillion things. I think clearly when he says that I'm going to build my church on this rock, he's talking about Peter. Any other read on that sentence and word order would be very unnatural in any translation, even as I bumble through it in the Greek, I would struggle for me to make an honest case, arguing that the best way to release the tension of the passage is to say, well, Jesus just wasn't talking about Peter when he said that Peter's this rock, he's going to build his church on it. So in this regard, I would agree with Catholics and I would read it the same way as those non-Catholics who would say, no, Jesus is definitely saying, I tell you that you are Peter and on this rock, by that I mean you Peter, I will build my church. I really do think that is what's being said here. But that still leaves a lot of questions about the actual significance of those remarks. Now again here, the Catholic would look at this and say this just isn't hard at all. Peter is given unique authority by Jesus and he has this authority and he can hand it off therefore as well. Well, I mean, I understand that's Catholic doctrine, but that stuff about handing it off, it's not overt in the rest of the text and the idea that wherever Peter dies, that is going to be the new headquarters of Christianity. That's really not spelled out in the text either. So I think it's a little more ambiguous than the level of certainty you might hear from a Catholic perspective. I suppose our options then are the Catholic perspective. Peter is in this unique position of authority and he does have power to hand off that authority to whomever he chooses next or another way to understand it would be in the context of the conversation that he and Jesus are having right now, which is that Peter as a representative of this gospel as a representative of the message that Jesus is the Christ that he has authority in this. And if that is the case, then this authority would also rest on all of the other apostles and this authority would rest on anyone who rightly proclaims that and sees that and has had their eyes opened and is the son, daughter, child, heir, agent representative of the kingdom. And that's substantiated by Ephesians chapter two. I'm sure it's verse 20. I remember this one. No, I was wrong. Yeah, 19 and 20, where it says consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God, people and members of God's household built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. So the language there in Ephesians two, written by Paul includes all of the apostles as being the foundation. And I don't think it's a coincidence that Paul intentionally used that language of foundation there in keeping with this foundational language that Jesus is using as he's talking with Peter and the rest of the disciples in chapter 16 in the passage that we're looking at. Right close to the end of the book of Revelation, you get another reference to the same concept that the church is founded on the apostles and their right confession of Christ. So if we grant that Jesus is talking about Peter when he says on this rock, I'll build my church from there, we've got two positions on what we do with that one. Peter is just like, he has the keys now. He has authority over all of this stuff for better words. That's who he is. I mean, it can't mean that Peter is now perfect and he's right in all of his judgments because as we'll talk about in a second, Peter isn't right in all of his judgments. Or the other option is that it means that Peter as rightly professing Jesus as the Christ as he just did is an ambassador of the chief message of the king and the kingdom. And in that, as he does that, there is authority because Christ is behind his church and he's going to make this thing happen, an idea that's reiterated a couple chapters over in 18. But then we get to this next part, which has some tricky language. I'll give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven, wherever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Well, understandably, the Catholic theologian looks at that and says, Peter gets this unique authority and with that unique authority, Jesus is saying that Peter then gets to engage in spiritual transactions that are efficacious, that actually affect things, including but not limited to even salvation, who is in the church and who is out. Now, I don't know any Catholic who would say Peter is the arbiter of salvation. The question of whether or not a person is ultimately saved. Jesus is in charge of the church. This is a place where I think all Christians agree. The question comes down to mediation. The Catholic position is much more optimistic about the role of the institution in this binding and loosing, if you will, in having a tremendous say as a gatekeeper and proprietor of the things of God in this world, whereas the non-Catholics, including the Orthodox, would question that Catholic claim to authority. The Protestants would out and out question any such claim to authority, whether it be Eastern in nature or Western in nature, saying that instead, what we have is not a unique priesthood created in this passage for Peter that is then handed off to other unique priests and a priest hierarchy, but that anyone who is a Christian and confesses Christ is effectively a priest that is the Protestant notion of the priesthood of all believers. Now both Catholics and non-Catholics agree that the scope of whatever you bind and whatever you lose is limited. Surely no Catholic theologian would argue that if Peter was like, we're just going to do something different than what Jesus wanted now, but I have these keys here so I can do that, that Peter could then just counter man to Jesus and rewrite the religion. They don't think that. They believe sincerely that what they've done is an outgrowth of the teachings of Christ. This is a quick side note. Whenever you see Peter portrayed in Catholic art, he will be holding keys. It's a very important reminder from the Catholic perspective to remember Peter was given these keys of authority to bind and loose and Peter is the founder of the true church and the true church is the one that is headquartered in Rome. So that's an important image and just kind of a fun thing to note as you're looking at art and how the different characters from the Bible are depicted by different expressions of Christianity. So the Catholic theologian would say that this binding and loosing power that comes with these keys is something unique to Peter and those on whom he confers it, that this does have theological authority, that this does make the transactions that happen with the various sacraments within the church, baptism, the Lord's Supper, ordination, etc. That all of these things are spiritually efficacious, not symbolic, and that only someone who has access to the keys given the authority of the church from Peter handed off by Jesus can rightly administer those sacraments. The non-Catholic position on these keys and this binding and loosing and this authority would be that Peter, as he confesses Christ, is an ambassador of the message of the kingdom and there is life and salvation in that message of the kingdom. And so anyone who goes out with that same confession that Peter was the first to boldly pronounce follows in the footsteps of Peter, but ultimately follows Jesus and there is salvific power, the power to transform a person from death to life in the work of Christ, in the message of Christ, in the reality of who Christ is. But you don't have to be Peter or approved by Peter in order to be an ambassador of that message and the non-Catholic position would go further and saying, okay, one, there's authority there to convey the message of Christ, but two, there's also authority there per Matthew 18 to correct what's going on in the church, which is a very difficult thing and we'll break that down more when we get to chapter 18. So the implications of these two positions are pretty significant. And if you want to understand Christianity and you want to understand how different people read the Bible, then there's no getting around it. We just had to have this conversation to make sense of it. I know that it can be overwhelming and even feel kind of icky when we talk about the places where Christians disagree, but this is an important one because it becomes a cipher for how you read a whole lot more of the text and how you read church history and how you read the relationship between the church and the state and a whole lot of other things. And so there's just nothing we can do except lean into it a little bit. I appreciate you doing so with me. In summary, we got two positions, both positions agree that Peter rightly identified Christ as the Messiah and that Jesus affirmed and expressed a blessing in regards to what Peter had said there, where the two positions diverge is that the Catholic position would hold that Jesus uniquely conferred authority upon Peter and that that authority was transferable and that the authority that the Catholic church still has is more than symbolic. It is tied to an apostolic succession, a succession of spiritual leaders tracing their origins all the way back to Peter and this moment right here in Matthew 16 and therefore the historical Catholic position would be he who does not have that church as his mother cannot have God as his father. The other read on this passage would be Peter was the first among equals. He's the first one to say this and Jesus rightly heaps on him. The blessing regarding what God had done in his life, but that did not make Peter infallible. Paul still had to correct Peter for getting stuff wrong in Galatians to Jesus is going to chew out Peter like is it literally on the same page that he calls Peter Satan. Yep, right here on the very same page. In case there was any illusion that Peter was special that's going to be broken in like five sentences as we work ahead. Peter is going to screw things up royally at the end of Jesus time in this world. He's going to deny Christ like Peter is absolutely not flawless. His judgments are not flawless, but Peter is right and is backed by God on a supernatural level as it pertains to him rightly confessing Christ and as it pertains to church discipline and correction for stuff that goes sideways. There's so much more here to unpack. Hopefully you have heard me as I have disclosed my biases and I encourage you to wrestle this through for yourself. We can work through the Bible together whether you're a person who doesn't think there's a God behind any of this or you're a person who comes at it more like me from kind of a Protestant-ish background or whether you're a person coming at this from a high church or Orthodox or Catholic background. The singular question doesn't set us on eternally different paths where we got nothing in common and I can't look at you or talk to you. I don't feel that way at all. I think there is a ton to be gained for us hanging out together as people with different assumptions looking at the same text and I've appreciated doing this with all of you because if you're still in the room at this point, not just on this episode but on this whole endeavor that we're on together, that means that you don't need me to think all the things you think. It means that you don't need everybody to think all the things that you think. It means that you like thinking honestly about it and trying to look at the whole question of faith and the Bible and Jesus and God and the big questions of life with eyes wide open and every now and then we get into more delicate territory than others and I appreciate you having the fortitude to be up for that not just when it's easy and goofy and fun but also when our journey through the text dictates a little bit more challenging conversation as it has the last few days. I like all of you. This is a blast. Thank you for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
