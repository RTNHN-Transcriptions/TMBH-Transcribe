This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. And a couple of times this week as we've been working on this whole Matthew 16 mariners diddy about red skies at night and the morning and what that all means. A couple of times as we've been going along with this, I've been saying that there's a manuscript question here that there's a little bit of debate about what we actually do with this historically as well to put it frankly. There's a question as to whether verses two and three are Bible or not. I really like this whole aspect of biblical studies that involves looking at these early manuscripts, but I'm a hack. And so even though I took my classes and I remember stuff about Greek and I can muddle through it really, really clumsily, for me, it's like decoding. It's like crackerjack stuff. I'm really just not, I'm not even close to an expert. I'm not the person to look to on this, but I know people. And so I've decided to call in a favor from a mutual acquaintance that I have with a bunch of other people I know and trust. This is Dr. Craig Blomberg. Dr. Craig, thank you for jumping in. Thank you for having me. Okay, you're a Denver seminary, correct? That's right. What do you do there? What's your area of specialization? The teach variety of courses in New Testament and Greek. And my buddy, Aaron Utect, who people on the podcast will be familiar with because he jumps on very often was one of your students, correct? Quite a while ago, yes, and a very good one. He's better than me at all of this stuff. So apparently you do your job well. We get into this passage here and I'm just cruising along and anybody with a Bible that has even the most basic of footnotes is going to notice a couple of marks in their Bible and they go down to the bottom, they're like, what's this about? And in the little italicized notes in the NIV, not the big study notes at the bottom, you'll see something that reads something like this. Note on verse two, some early manuscripts do not have the rest of verse two and all of verse three. Now Craig, you were on the NIV translation committee, correct? I am on the committee. Have been since 2008. Do questions like this come up a lot? How much stuff is there in the New Testament where there's this kind of sufficient debate about the early manuscripts supporting it that it requires a note? Well, a simple way to answer that is to do what you just did and that is put through the pages of whatever your favorite modern translation is and see how often you get footnotes like that. Sometimes in some books you average one almost every page or a couple of pages, but if you're asking about segments of text as long as one or two full verses like we have here, then there are at most maybe a couple dozen in the entire New Testament. Okay. So we talked here about Acts, what is it, Acts 837? During the baptism with the Ethiopian eunuch there's one verse that seems to be poorly supported, poorly represented or questionably represented in the early manuscript evidence. I feel like I sound smart when I say all those words because it has all of these syllables and stuff. If you really pushed me to explain it, I might wilt. What does good manuscript evidence look like and what does questionable manuscript evidence look like? People that specialize in that talk about two kinds of evidence, they talk about external evidence, which means which manuscripts say one thing, which manuscripts say something else? How old are they? How generally reliable have they proved to be overall? How many of such manuscripts support one reading versus another? Where they were found, are they part of a family or group of very similar manuscripts where there's reason to believe that they were all copied in conjunction with each other somehow? That's the external evidence. And then the other thing they ask is about internal evidence and that is given the options in this case where the verses there originally are not, which is more likely? Is it more likely that scribes would have for some reason come in and left these out if they were there originally or is it more likely that they would have added them in for some reason and that they weren't there originally? When both of those kinds of evidence lean in the same direction, then textual critics rejoice and they go good. We have a pretty good handle on this where it gets sticky is when one leans in one direction and one leans in another or, as we'll see here in Matthew 16, 2 to 3, it's a very delicate balance of arguments foreign against no matter how you look at it. Do you know, are there any modern translations that omit the second half of verse two and then verse three? You know, I was looking early this morning at about 15 or so of the most well-known translations. I did not see one of the major translations that actually omitted them, but the ones that typically do put in footnotes all had footnotes very similar to what you read out of the NIB. So you would characterize this then as being just on the positive side of the inflection point of certainty enough to say, yeah, that goes in there without anything more than a little footnote. Whereas say the long ending of Mark deserves maybe more than just a subtle footnote. Is that a fair comparison? Yes, most definitely. The long ending of Mark is understood by all but the smallest handful of biblical scholars, not to have been original. It's not in the oldest and most reliable text and it has all kinds of theological problems with it. It appears in many different versions in the later manuscripts where it does appear. So that one's from a scholars point of view almost a slam dunk. This one here, while the continuous basketball metaphor, the game is tied at the end of the third overtime and we're still not sure who's going to win. Let's stay on the technical just a little bit longer here. Do you know off the top of your head, and this is not a fair question, but do you have a sense of about when the earliest occurrence of this specific passage is in the manuscript evidence? I look at my Greek text here, so I'm not intentionally saying something that leads people astray. It's important of course to say for listeners who aren't familiar with the ages of manuscripts, the earliest manuscripts that we have for the gospels are very fragmentary. They tend to just have select chapters or certain portions of the text and they are mid to late second century, it's not until we get into the third century that we get entire gospels and we start to get some collections of gospels and it's not until we are in the fourth century that we begin to have nearly complete new testaments that have still been preserved. What's interesting about this issue is that the two oldest and generally viewed to be most reliable, nearly complete manuscripts which are both fourth century, both omit the words and a family of manuscripts that is known for nerds who like numbers as family 13, that includes a variety of older manuscripts from several of the early centuries, also omits it as well as some early translations from the Greek into languages like Syriac, Coptic, a language of ancient Egypt and Armenian, the language of ancient Armenia. However, once you've said that, family one which is another family of manuscripts that includes some of the earliest that we have the major complete new testaments from the fifth century and just about everything else from then on has these two verses. So that's what we're facing. Does Jerome include it? Do my chicken tracks and my footnotes include Jerome. Jerome does include it, yes. Okay. Is he a serious, Christian, Hillary, Dustin, but not Orgian? Well Orgian was always goofy. Okay. So what about the major codices? I mean, I think of what are the four? Sinaiticus. So the Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, the two oldest, Wackett and then AC and D, Alex and his friend, new scriptist, Codex B's, I all have it. Okay. So it's even, it's even split. And I didn't explain that very well to people sitting in our conversation. But what we're talking about here, when we say Codex, we're talking about pretty much a complete presentation of the entire New Testament as Dr. Blomberg was alluding to a minute ago. So there, I think of there as being like four rock star codexes that you compare with each other. And it's, it's split down the middle with Jerome's Latin Vulgate, including it. So this is kind of a doozy, isn't it? It is. Dr. Blomberg, I hate to interrupt. We had talked about just doing one conversation here. This is so good and so interesting and so much more comprehensive than what I was doing on my own. Would you be up for continuing the conversation for a few minutes and letting us split this into two conversations in post? Absolutely. Cool. All right. I'm going to hit pause there, my friends. We'll see you right back next time around with Dr. Craig Blomberg to unpack this manuscript question about Matthew chapter 16. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
