And right now we're talking about Galatians. This thing I got to talk about here, I know I've mentioned it to you a couple of times before, but it's always on my mind. That's why it keeps coming up. My family recently made the disappointing decision to get a puppy. I don't know is a moment of weakness. We were going through some stuff. We got a puppy. We got specifically a palm ski puppy. It's a Pomeranian Husky. And you would think that science wouldn't allow that, but you're wrong. The Bureau of Science looked into it and apparently authorized that that could be a dog now. So I imagine a few years ago there's scientists with very tall, erratic eccentric hair and goggles, not the kind that have the little ear clips like normal glasses, but the kind that are so important. They have a strap that goes all the way around the head and a thick white heavy lab coat and probably big rubber gloves that go all the way up to the elbow. And I imagine that the scientists just went and got a Pomeranian and went and got a Husky. And then there was some kind of machine that makes lightning happen. And he put them both in like a clear glass container for a minute. And then the lightning charged both the containers and then a third container that had been empty. There was maybe a puff of smoke in there. And then he lifted up the container and used his rubber glove to fluff away the smoke and what was in there. A tiny little baby perpetual puppy Husky with blue eyes that is never going to grow up. It's like having a Husky that is in the best stage of Husky dumb except forever. So we decided we were going to get one of those and we did. We named her Freya. She's a little white wolf. She's got the blue eyes and the curly tail. She's adorable. I mean, this literally might be the cutest puppy that I can conceive of, but she's just a rascal and she won't listen to anything I say. It's almost as if she doesn't speak English because we are having tons of lengthy, if a little bit one sided conversations about her behavior, but nothing changes. I bring her in after she poops on the floor and I'm like, Hey, did you see what you did there? You pooped on the floor. Now I've told you repeatedly, I don't want you to do that. She looks at me and cocks her head. Their ears get a little bit pointier yet. I'm like, now you're going to have to go, you have to go in your kennel and think about what you did. And she's like, okay. And then she just goes in there. Like, it doesn't even phase her or all of a cord that I can't put away. It needs to be stretched right there right now. Cause I'm doing something. I look over, she's chewing on the cord. I'm like, Hey, you can't chew on the cord. It's bad for the cord. It's bad for you. It's bad for me getting my work done. I explain everything super clearly. I move her to another place. I give her something else to do a toy or whatever. Two minutes go by. What happens? She's over there chewing on that cord again. Wash, rinse, repeat. I keep having the conversation. It's like it doesn't matter what I do unless I put her in her kennel and lock her up. She's going to go right back to doing the thing that I said not to do. Likewise in the book of acts, that's how the disciples are. They're the lab created perpetual Husky puppy with blue eyes. I don't know. The metaphor kind of breaks down here. They're the puppy in the situation and the authority figures in the situation. I'm the metaphor for that. And no matter what the authority figures tell Peter and John and the other disciples to do, they just go and keep doing the thing. I guess I just wanted to tell you more about my puppy. Acts chapter five. Here's the deal. Remember Peter and John, they went to the temple and miracle happened there. A crippled guy gets healed and then the religious leaders were like, you can't be doing stuff like that. And then Peter and John are like, why are you against people with broken legs, having their legs unbroken? It seems like this is just inarguably good. And right now you guys are being weird. Think about how weird you guys are being. You're backed into a corner ideologically so badly that you're against this guy who's over 40 years old and has been crippled since birth now having full functionality in his legs and praising God. Why would you not want that? They didn't say exactly that. They didn't really say that at all. But that's kind of how I read the situation from a public perception point of view. It's such a bad look for the religious leaders to get mad about that. And they kind of realize there's nothing they can do. So how does that story end? Well, it's like, you don't do that anymore. We just gave you a firm talking to you. Don't go back out there and do it. And kind of in the same way that I think that when Freya cocks her head and looks at me when I'm telling her to not do that anymore, what she means is I'm going to go do it again. In the same way, the disciples are like, well, I mean, you tell us what makes more sense. Should we obey you or obey God? Then the religious leaders, they don't seem to really have a good answer to that. And then sure enough, like two seconds later, the disciples are right back out there chewing on the metaphorical court again, doing exactly what they were told not to do again. But in the meantime, there's this little aside that happens in Acts chapter five, I teased yesterday or last time around, that there's going to be resistance from within because this is a conflict book, the book of Acts leading us up to a conflict book that we're working on in this season, which is the book of Galatians. And so it turns out that they're fake people who don't believe in the Jesus thing, but they really like the vibe of what the disciples are doing. And some people come along and they're like, there's a real financial opportunity here to exploit these rubes by simply pretending to believe the things they believe and then saying, oh, yeah, yeah, we're, we want to make a bunch of donations and be in on this whole thing where we all share food and lodging and expenses together. While they secretly hold back a whole bunch of their money, they get all the benefits of being a part of this community. But they don't make any of the contributions or any meaningful contributions to the community. Their names are Ananias and Sephira. And so you get this little detail in Acts chapter five, it seems real harsh because they both end up dying, I guess, at the hand of the Holy Spirit. I mean, it pretty much looks like God's judgment is upon them after they lie about this thing and basically try to solely and mock the whole situation here. I don't know about you, but if you've ever been around something that was really cool and then somebody acts like a turd and ugly, distasteful things happen, it can kind of take the luster off of the whole thing. It's like, ah, this whole thing was awesome. Now it's a joke. Now it's just a mockery, Ick. Well the way the situation plays out in Acts chapter five with these two deceitful people who try to exploit and damage and bastardize the fledgling community of faith. The way it plays out at the clear message to take away from it is God really can't be mocked, which is going to come up again explicitly when we get to Galatians. But the other thing is surely people from the outside were looking to this and be like, ah, it's too good to be true. I bet there's a bunch of people in there pulling shenanigans and sure enough, wherever shenanigans can be pulled, someone will try to pull shenanigans, but it is quickly and apparently supernaturally resolved, which is both terrifying and fascinating, but nobody seems to apparently miss a beat and as we move on into Acts chapter five, everybody's still the hundred percent full on board with Jesus saying they're all excited about it and the disciples turn around and they're going right back to chewing on the cord, right back to the temple to Solomon's colonnade and they're telling people Jesus is a Messiah, the Messiah who we've all been looking for. He's shown up. He is Jesus of Nazareth. He went to the cross. He died. He was raised on the third day. He ascended to the right hand of the Father, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. All the stuff that we've been looking forward to is here. What? Follow Christ and all of that might sound street preachery and like I have heard people yelling things like that on a college campus or on a street corner. It kind of sounded weird when they did it. Yeah, but here's what they weren't doing. Miracles left and right. They were tangible, measurable, real, demonstrable, life changing miracles. People are having their lives changed. Physical things are transforming before people's eyes. Do I know what to do with that? Nope, not totally. Have I ever seen something like that? Nope. I'm not told I have not, but the fact that the Bible holds out that that is what was happening here in Acts chapter five really helps to explain the answer to that question you and I have been considering as a background process through all of this, which is why is there a Christianity? Well, intelligent people from a long time ago looked at what was happening and were like, uh, that's real. I've never seen anything like that before. I can't explain it, but whatever that is, I'm in. Remember these people weren't rubes back then. They weren't idiots and sometimes it's tempting to think that like, well, you're so smart. How come you died? Because everybody dies and time passes. But the truth of the matter is we're not looking at a time when everybody was a hillbilly moron. These people were intelligent, competent people who could read the scene socially and who could use reason to evaluate what was going on. And people from all across the class and racial spectrum were signing up for this thing in droves. The high pre start to freak out about all of that and they have Peter and John arrested. Now we see in Acts chapter five that a little bit of a shift in power is occurring here. The political party called the Sadducees, a religious political party whose platform includes being against the concept of resurrection. They've gained some clout in recent years at this point and they seem to be just as mad as the Pharisees, even if for slightly different reasons about what's going on. And so the religious leadership, which includes a lot of Sadducees now and also Pharisees, they have Peter and John arrested. They bring him in. They're like, Hey, we told you a quick showing on the court and Peter and John are like, Yeah, and we told you, remember, like right as we were leaving, we were like, Hey, should we obey you or obey God? That was kind of us saying, we're going to go back and chew on the cord. We're not really going to do your thing at all. But thank you for the nice meeting and the good talk and the religious leadership is like, Dang it. No chewing on the court. We still mean it, but they get the impression that Peter and John are still going to chew on the court. So like, all right, give us a minute. We got to talk. And so after they send Peter and John out of the room, they get together and like, I guess we should maybe kill them and see if that solves the problem, but a wise old dude named Gamaliel. Some people say Gamaliel. I think that sounds dumb. So I'm going to go with Gamaliel. He gets up. He's like, I've been doing this a long time. Paraphrase is mine. No, I think we should pump the brakes here and think a little bit more reasonably specifically says an acts five 35 men of Israel considered carefully what you intend to do to these men. Some time ago, the it disappeared claiming to be somebody and about 400 men rallied to him. He was killed and all his followers were dispersed and it all came to nothing. So he's talking about some religious leader who didn't amount too much after him. Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed and all his followers were scattered. Quick side note. We actually have historical references to these guys, which is just kind of a cool extra biblical confirmation here that I mean, this stuff is all happening in a real place in a real time with real people and all of this occurred. Then a verse 38, Gamaliel goes on, therefore in the present case, I advise you, leave these men alone. Let them go for if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it'll fail. But if it's from God, you won't be able to stop these men. You'll only find yourselves fighting against God. So that persuades the room and they're like, all right, bring Peter and John back in there. They're like, you guys got to stop it. And no killing today, but we're just going to give you a really firm flogging and let that be a lesson to you. And Peter and John are like, okay, Doki, then they get flogged and they leave rejoicing with their backs all turned into shredded up hamburger. They're like totally worth it. Totally worth it. And what do you suppose they do after that? Yeah, that's right. They go back and chew on the court some more right back to the temple, right back to the preaching in public. Here's how the chapter ends day after day in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ. Look, it's not hard for me to see this one from the perspective of the religious leaders, even though they're the bad guys, because I know what it is to try to get the behavior under control of somebody who just won't cooperate. That being Freyja the dog with her blue eyes and her pointy ears and her fluffy downy white fur. I say, don't chew on the court. I move her somewhere else. Maybe I squirted her with the spray bottle. That would be the equivalent of flogging in this situation. And it doesn't matter. She's going to chew on the court if she wants to chew on the court. I just, she's not giving me a lot of options. She's very dedicated to that court chewing. Likewise, I don't think there's any version of a good firm talking to that you can give to Peter and John and the other disciples given what they've seen to make them shut up. So our conflict collision course continues between the religious establishment and the values of the kingdom of Jesus and the teaching of Jesus and the teaching of Jesus disciples. And final note, since I'm sure you're now curious, I'm going to go post a picture of that adorable puppy over there at the Patreon page at patreon.com slash the T M P H podcast.
