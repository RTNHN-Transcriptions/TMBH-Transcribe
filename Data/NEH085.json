This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and my voice is still not right from basketball. What is this? One, two, three, three nights ago? I really yelled, and then there was a hockey game. I was not thinking, two nights later, there's a hockey game, and the team I was rooting for, of course, is Colorado Avalanche. I root for Colorado Sports. It's got a breakaway and scored a super important pivotal goal, and I stood up and started to yell, and my daughter grabbed me by the arm. I was like, don't do it, Dad. So it was only like a third of a yell, but I think it was a bit of a setback. So here we are, I'm a little bit whispering today, whatever. It'll just feel like we're hanging out in a library. It'll be real fun. I think at some point in our history, you and I have talked about the enormously forgettable movie, Hancock, and Will Smith in it, and what's their name? Blondley Charlie is there on, and it's not a good show, but it's weird. The pacing is bizarre. In fact, the bizarre pacing is probably the most memorable thing about Hancock, because you start watching the thing and you get part way through and you think, okay, well, that was a movie. It was the beginning, a middle, and an end. It wasn't great, but whatever, at least it's over. And then a second movie happens with a different plot. It breaks all the rules of storytelling and the structure, and it's terribly disorienting. Look, Nehemiah and Ezra are way better than Hancock, just miles better. But I could see how on your first pass, first glance, it might seem like you're getting two very different stories. Like the story you're interested in kind of wraps up, and then a whole other thing happens. Now, I'm going to argue in a minute for why I think the structure of Ezra and Nehemiah actually makes a ton of sense. But for now, let's just give it the Hancock treatment and consider why this pacing and structure is a little bit weird. What would you say right now has been the main plot of Nehemiah? This isn't hard. If you've been hanging out with me, you know what it is. I mean, one word gets it done, right? What's a one word that has been the plot? Wall. It's been all about the wall. We've got to get the wall built. There's been some undercurrents and subtext and drama and things like that. But the wall is the point. That's the plot. There isn't a wall. Somebody decides there's going to be a wall. It's really hard to make a wall eventually against all odds. They make a wall. And that's what we get in Nehemiah 615. So the wall was completed on the 25th day of El Lule in 52 days. So then I think it would feel natural to simply wrap up the book right here. All the quits we don't really need a chapter 7. I guess we understand how things worked out there. The plot was there needs to be a wall and now there's a wall. But then you turn the page and you know, what the heck? Why is there 13 chapters then? Are we going to do the Hancock thing or are we going to hold other movie? And the answer is kind of, kind of, yeah, we're going to do a whole other movie. But if you zoom out from Nehemiah and you consider the big picture of Ezra and Nehemiah and what these two books together, and they were one book in the first place, what these two books together are doing, then what we discover is the whole wall thing is really just one act. It's the middle act of the story. Act one. And you could argue that there's maybe four acts here, but I'm going to argue that two of the acts fit together and make up one. They're just kind of spaced weird. Act one of Ezra and Nehemiah is all about the rebuilding of the temple in general. This is a rubable and all of that business. We're going all the way back in time to the reign of Cyrus in the 530s BC. We're talking about stuff that happened during the reign of Darius, the first big time successor to Cyrus in the five teens BC. And then there's a big jump in time that happens right in the middle of Ezra at the end of Ezra Nehemiah. Act one. And that occurs between chapters six and chapter seven. Can you hear my voice bailing out? I can hear a bailing out. I think we got this. So I'm just going to be more library like it's going to feel even creepier. That's too much. We can't do the full whisper. I'm going to stop that right now. So I'm going to say act one of Ezra Nehemiah wraps up at the end of Ezra six act two or the rest of Ezra is all about the rebuilding of the people. It's a rubable rebuild the temple in the first place, but then the long comes Ezra. And now he's the guy who's rebuilding the people and one of his big concerns in rebuilding the people is making sure that he's rebuilding the right people. That is the actual returning exiles who are the chosen people of God, a nation of priests set apart as well as very particular about making sure that those who are in are in and those who do not have a share in the inheritance are not sounds kind of mean by modern standards. But as we discussed yesterday, every nation in all of history has had a sense of who is a part of their nation and who is a foreigner. And the second half of Ezra, one of the big challenges is that the returning exiles have moved back to Jerusalem. They have a temple now and everything, but they went right back to doing what got them in trouble in the first place. They're marrying all of their neighbors, which mingles the question of citizenship who has an inheritance of what what are the cultural and religious expectations. And as a result, they got real fat and real soft and they made entangling alliances with each other through marriage that tie up money and even potential military and violence and governed mental alliances. And also they're mingling cultures. So they're starting to make the same mistake, which is their key mistake through the entire Old Testament, that being idolatry, they're heading down that path again. And Ezra is so upset that he starts yanking out his hair and doing public displays of outrage over and he's like, how can you screw this up again? What are you doing? And to their credit, most of the people repent and they take drastic steps as a people to try to unmake the mistakes that they have made. Then we get to the end of Ezra and we just want to put a pin in that narrative about who are the chosen people of God? Who are the citizens? Who has a part in this inheritance and who does not? But as we conclude, Ezra, there might still be questions about why does that even matter? Why are we being so picky? Again, we got a pin in that. Well, then we turn to what is act two B because act two A is kind of suspended and it's going to get resolved in act three. The stuff you and I just did from Nehemiah chapter one all the way up to the end of Nehemiah chapter six is act two B. It's a lot of drama and adventure and it's about the rebuilding of the wall. Okay. Now the wall is rebuilt, but what we discover in chapter five with the economic crisis and the exploitative noble episode and what we discover in chapter six that we've been talking about for the last few days with the betrayals from within and the false prophets of God and the nobles doing more discreet, dirty stuff behind the scenes with the enemies. We discovered that the people still aren't fixed. There's been some nice unity. We had a cool build montage. The wall is up. That's great. Most people seem to be in and refocused. Ezra's attempt to heal things. It hasn't fully taken and Nehemiah has been focused on the wall. He's dished out a few lectures and forced people to bend the knee on a few things, but he hasn't fixed the people yet either. So it's almost like the structure of this story is we come into it with a great big huge crisis. The Jewish people are in exile and they don't have a temple. Everything's ruined. How will the redemptive plan of God move forward? How will the Jews even survive? But Cyrus, the great comes along and says, go back and rebuild. So big step one is rebuild the temple. But along the way, we get introduced to the idea that really it's about rebuilding the people. Even if you rebuild the temple and make it look really cool, if the people and the generations to come, don't get it and they're not behind it and they're not unified in the service of God and rejecting idols. Well, I mean, who cares if you have a building? It's going to end up getting toppled because there won't be the social or political or religious will to keep it in place. So it seems like the problem is the temple, but really the problem is the people and getting them to where they need to be. Then in the next episode, which is kind of act two, same thing, we got to get a wall built. But is the wall really matter if people inside the walls can be bought for a few bucks and will exploit their own people? If you don't stand back to back with each other, if you don't have a sense of unity or cultural and religious clarity and direction together, a sense of the narrative, does the wall really even matter? Somebody inside will just throw open the gates like F.E. Altees did for the Persians when they attacked the Spartans at the battle of Thermopylae. No, the problem still isn't fixed because the people are still broken. And that is why the book of Ezra and Nehemiah is not like the horrific film Hancock, but instead is more like a multi-layered novel where you have one big underlying problem. And the whole story is tracking that big underlying problem that really is a heart problem. It's a character problem. But in the meantime, you've still got crises and adventures that need to get dealt with, but all these crises and adventures really do serve to demonstrate that the heart of the main character, the character of the main character that is the returning exiles is still not where it needs to be. So this third act that you and I are about to embark on starting in Nehemiah chapter seven next time around is where we're either going to sink or swim. Lottie die, you built a temple, Lottie die, you built some walls. That's great. Anybody can do that. Can you keep it? I can never remember exactly how it goes, but doesn't Benjamin Franklin have some kind of quote like that as he was getting old and he says to the next generation, here's your Republic. If you can keep it and that's the question here. Can the returning exiles keep it? How do you fix what is still wrong with a damaged people who are on a razor's edge? They fall one way and maybe they will keep it. They fall the other way and they'll make the same mistakes they've made in the past. So what needs to happen now is the people need to become reacquainted with who they are. They need to become reacquainted with the character of their God. And if they are to achieve that, they're going to have to do so by revisiting the law. That is the whole story of God and all the things that he's revealed about his plans for this unique set apart people and they're going to have to bend the knee to that and not like the nobles bent the knee to Nehemiah in chapter five. They're like, oh, yeah, sorry, we'll get back the money and everything that we exploited people out of. But then they go right back to weaseling in a new way. No, they're going to have to mean it and actually bend the knee to actual God. Can they do that? And can they do that without spiraling into an overreaction religious fundamentalism that causes them to make fresh new mistakes in the opposite direction? There's a lot at stake in this final act of Nehemiah and that's why if Ezra Nehemiah wrapped up at the end of chapter six, it really would be an incomplete story and it would fail to set the ball on the tee. It would fail to set us up to understand the world into which Jesus was born when we get over to the New Testament. This home stretch is going to be fun. It's going to be interesting and it's going to have so much connective tissue with what we did back in Matthew and with all of the New Testament stuff that we're going to get into in our next season, which is on the book of Galatians.
