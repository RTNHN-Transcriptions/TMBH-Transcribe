This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and you know, it's really cool. Joseph of Arimathea seems like a dude who's principled and generous and willing to put his name and his reputation and his money on the line for what he thought was right. This guy, when it was very unfashionable to like Jesus, I mean, it had been fashionable to like Jesus in the city of Jerusalem, like we had less than a week earlier, but that was like a week ago, bro. Now Jesus, like that's not somebody you want to have your name next to. Joseph of Arimathea though, he liked Jesus when it was cool and he liked Jesus when it wasn't cool. And I think we all respect somebody like that. So then Joseph of Arimathea goes to Pontius Pilate and is like, I want that body. The body of that man who's an outcast and rejected, I will identify with him and pilots like, yeah, find whatever shirt. Great. And because of that little story, we rightly hold Joseph of Arimathea in high regard, but as so often the case when somebody's real, real exceptional and cool in real life and in reality, myths and legends and all sorts of other things get attributed to such people after the fact and it can take a little bit of work to sort through what is real and what is bonus material fan fiction. Well, Joseph of Arimathea, as we discussed yesterday, he got a lot of fan fiction associated with him dating all the way up to like very recent times with popular movies and books that have come out while you and I have been alive. So yesterday we covered a whole bunch of stuff about Joseph of Arimathea and what Matthew is going through here. But let's just settle this thing down a little bit and go back and look at what we actually know about this very interesting character and then maybe we'll have time today to get into what stuff we don't actually know, but that we might have heard his reputation or myth attributed to him later. Matthew 2757, his evening approach that came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Okay, what can we learn from this? He's from Arimathea. Where is Arimathea? It's really funny because it sounds like, oh, he's from this far away place. This is all happening in Jerusalem, but he's not Joseph of Jerusalem. He's Joseph of Arimathea, which is like 12 miles away from the city center. I don't think that if you drove to the place where Arimathea sort of still is or was back in the day that you would even notice, I think it would be like a couple grocery stores away in terms of your commute across the northwest side of the massive urban center that is Jerusalem. But back then, I guess that was far enough away that you got a name attached to it. It's just funny though. Second thing we learned from this passage is somewhere along the way he became a disciple of Jesus. That's a follower of Jesus. Disciples is a pretty active word in the New Testament. This is someone who is actively receiving teaching and instruction and guidance from Jesus. He is internalizing the words of Jesus. He's sold on Jesus being who Jesus says he is. All right. What do we learn next verse 58? Going to pilot, he asked for Jesus' body and pilot ordered that it be given to him. I wonder what that conversation was like. I wonder if pilot was still in washes hand's mode and if pilot had just been done and out on the Jesus thing entirely from the moment he gave the order and walked away. Or if the pilot of medieval legend, because pilot like Joseph of Arimathea, oh, wow, there's so much stuff about him after the fact. People seem to really care about how this interaction with Jesus affected pilots so much so that they're willing to write the equivalent of medieval comic books about him. So do we have an indifferent pilot here or do we have a pilot who's racked with guilt and overwhelmed and confused the pilot of later fiction who writes an account back to Tiberius, the emperor of Rome, is like this man was God in the flesh, you know, taken on a little bit of the language of the centurion who a few verses earlier recognized Jesus for who he was, at least in part. Is this a pilot who can't sleep at night and has dreams as he's tortured by demons and pulled down into a river and then later he does go back to talk to Tiberius and Tiberius is like, you screwed everything up, dumb, stupid, idiot, you terrible governor, you don't get to govern anything anymore ever. Some of the legends say that Tiberius made pilot kill himself or choose the option of being killed by Roman soldiers. There's other stories where Tiberius tells pilot that he has to go live in Gaul modern day France. Now I think France is lovely. I think that's a weird punishment, but that's one of the legends and that he goes to where is it? Leon? I don't remember off the top of hand. I think it might have been Leon and upon arriving there, he's like, I just forget it. I don't belong here and he throws himself in a river and he dies and he's tortured by demons and sometimes you can still see his body in there. Some other people say that Pontius Pilate went there and lived this noble life and reached people for the Lord. Other people say that he went and drowned himself in a little lake on top of some mountains in Switzerland called Lake Pilatus, actually named after him. And then on certain days of the year, you can still see his haunted ghost struggling to get above the surface of the water as he's dragged down by the demons that torture and because of what he did to Jesus. Other people have him ending up in Scotland or England and it is very interesting how many of these stories that I'm throwing out, at least geographically parallel. Some of the claims about Joseph of Arimathea, the guy who here in verse 58 is getting a private meeting with Pilate to ask him about what's going to happen with the body. I don't know after doing a mountain of research on Pilate and all of the information we have about him after the fact, I got no clear sense of who this guy was after the Jesus encounter. If someday I found out that he would have shrugged at it and was like just another guy executed, I got bigger fish to fry than that and that was the end of it. That would not surprise me based on the historical evidence I've seen. If someday we found out that it absolutely transformed the entire future of Pilate's political career and his marriage and his family line, that wouldn't surprise me either based on the evidence we have but we just can't say for sure. And so Joseph of Arimathea encounters a Pontius Pilate who is in some state of mind. I can guarantee you he was worried about his own skin and he was rightly worried because his time and power here came to an end not too long after and it looks like it came to an end on not the best of terms. So whether out of indifference or a desire to appease a pursuit of penance, Pilate's like sure great yeah take the body, find whatever. So Joseph takes the body and wraps it in a clean linen cloth. Now he's probably doing Pilate a favor here because disposing of the body if you're a Roman governor of Judea after you crucify them is a bit of a tricky thing. We talked yesterday about public graves even unmarked graves being one way to do that but you can't just leave the body out to get it picked apart by vultures and crows like you would in other parts of the empire. The Jewish people you're trying to govern would never have it. So Joseph does pilot a solid he's like I'll take the body wraps it in a clean linen cloth. So already just two verses in to getting to know this Joseph of Arimathea character we can see that he's someone who's very interested in giving burial dignity to the body of Christ. This clean linen cloth being evidence of that. Oh my goodness. Look at the time we are going to be talking about this burial week for quite a while I suspect because there's a lot of interesting details here like for example this we talked yesterday about the relic associated with Joseph of Arimathea which is of course the holy grail something that doesn't become that big a deal in terms of capturing the imagination of the Christian West until the Middle Ages the crusades a little bit later on but still retroactively Joseph of Arimathea is associated with that. Well here's another mega relic from the ancient world that being the shroud of Turin right. Is this it this linen cloth that Joseph of Arimathea wraps him in is this the shroud that is held in Italy that for a long time people have looked at and said well look at that there's like a negative imprint there's a relief of the picture of a man and the time looks right and maybe that's the image of Jesus from his resurrection is by the power of the resurrection he made a permanent imprint on this particular fabric. I think we've talked about this before I'm not at all sold on the validity of the claims surrounding the shroud of Turin but it's interesting that that maybe most famous of all relics comes up right here as well. Then as we talked about yesterday Joseph of Arimathea continues to bestow burial dignity on the body of Christ he places Jesus body in Joseph of Arimathea's own new tomb which I think we can take as a hint that Joseph was into some new money he was probably entrepreneurial and was moving up in the world the closer you got to Jerusalem in this world for your family tombs the better off you are is a big step forward and he honors Jesus by taking this thing that I think would have been one of his most prized possessions this kind of real estate in Jerusalem so close to the holy mount so close to the temple the place where God lives and he's going to put somebody's not even related to in there well I am who is my brother my sister my mother but it's a person who does the will of my father in heaven so maybe in Joseph of Arimathea's mind Jesus is family and then finally we get the description of this big stone being rolled in place that is a check-offs gun that is going to factor in very prominently later in the story there's also an apologetic device there and the Matthew setting it up as he's really really really dead Joseph of Arimathea who is really really really wealthy and well known is yet another reliable witness to the true death of Jesus Joseph of Arimathea saw the body claimed the body touched the body had the body properly treated for burial and then had that body placed in a place he knows and has a deed to and there was a giant stone in front you could still go see the stone and the grave if you wanted to when we read this 2000 years after the fact we maybe don't immediately catch how effective and apologetic this would all be but by giving these specifics Matthew is also challenging the original audience reader to go and look it up for yourself just walk over there look ask people you can do the math for yourself see if it looks like a fraud to you like what you're being told by the religious leaders or see if it looks like Jesus actually did come back from the grave we got more we got to cover here I want to talk more about relics and what they mean I want to take that little rabbit trail further into the middle ages and I want to go and look at some of the other accounts and Mark and Luke and John to see if we can learn a bit more about this enigmatic but compelling character who is Joseph of Arimathea I'm having fun I just love
