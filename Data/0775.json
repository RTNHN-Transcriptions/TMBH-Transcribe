This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. I know a ton of you have been doing this with me since the beginning. I know some of you found out about the conversation we were having here and you jumped in and you were like, yeah, I'm just, I'm going to binge it. I'm going to catch up and you powered all the way through and you caught up and now you're live in real time with us. I know others of you, like I just have a friend who's been telling me about this and they enjoy it and they keep, they just won't leave me alone. And so I am giving it a try right now to be a good sport because I value my friendship. There's just a lot of different places that you can be coming from that would land you here. I'm just grateful we're in the same room. I think it's cool. I know we don't think the same stuff on everything. I know that we're not in the same place in terms of the unfolding of our lives and our journey of wrestling with the big questions. And obviously, I mean, we're dealing with the document here that holds itself out as being from the God, the maker of all the things. And that's a big bold claim and that's going to hit everybody's ears a little differently. And through the course of our conversation, working through Matthew, I've tried to consider very often what would it be like to encounter this text if you were in this place, if you were in this place, if you were in this place. And that's kind of easy for me because I've been in a lot of those places and I maybe have a couple of them yet to go. I went through the book of Matthew. It was the first book I ever read beginning to end. I have actual written proof in my super old school Bible that is right there. I can see it and I can even see dates in it from my childhood because I wrote down dates as I went through Matthew and jotted down my primitive little kid notes. But when I read through that, when the version of me who put that ink on that page right there, I was reading that text through the lenses of a kid raised by a pastor in a church context. I never felt forced or manipulated to think Christian things or do Christian things. Nah, that's not true. They made me sing specials in church whether I wanted to or not, but that was about it. And yet still being raised in the context of faith like that is going to affect the way you read the document. And so I read it like somebody who'd never considered anything else ever and I wrote in my Bible right there. Then I read the whole thing as a college student. It was like, dang, I don't know what my future holds at all. And then I read it again as somebody in my 20s who was leading other people and trying to act like I knew what I was doing when I really didn't and deep down, it had never occurred to me that I was going to die someday, but it started to occur to me somewhere in my 20s. And that read through Matthew that I did, that was my third read through Matthew. That one hit me different. There's a lot of emotion in that one. And then church got weird stuff went wrong. I don't think I've ever told those stories here, but I got to a real weird place working at churches and a ton of good things that happened too. But man, I don't know. It just, it caught up with me and my faith, I just broke. Yeah, I don't need to regale you with all of those details, but this is what I would say in the most literal sense. Somewhere in my late 20s, early 30s, I went from believing there's definitely a God and the stuff I had read three times in the book of Matthew, it just checks out. And then some stuff happened and a little bit after that, I was like, you know what? Weird. It's like there's nothing on the other end. It's like I kind of felt intellectually, emotionally this connection. And now I do not feel it. And if you hook me up to a lie detector during that time, I've been like, is there a God? Do you think there is a God? My truth answer would have been no. Now I know a lot of very earnest atheists who are like, that does not count. There's just not enough atheism. You didn't believe that long enough. You didn't believe it sincerely enough. That was a faith crisis you were going through. I don't know. Sure felt like atheism to me. Like, yeah, I don't know. People can read into that. Whatever they want, make of it, whatever you want. But you know what I read during that time? Matthew. And it read a lot different when I was in that moment of life. Well, then some stuff happens and I gradually start building a grown up faith and I end up doing church stuff again. After that, for a period of time, which is awesome, that went great. I went through the Book of Matthew now in a very different place in life as a dad, as a husband with another couple rounds of education under my belt. And I go back through the Book of Matthew and that reading in my 30s and into my 40s. I was like, wow, this is a totally different experience than last time. I'm asking different questions. I just took up too much of your time. That was self-indulgent. That was too much of me. Thank you for enduring that. The point I was trying to make is, man, I might not be able to relate to anywhere that you're at, but I can relate to a lot of places that you might be at as somebody listening to these conversations about Matthew. The point of everything I'm talking about here is just the unavoidable, what do you do with it, that we're at in Matthew 28, where we're being told that Jesus did all this stuff and then he said that he was going to die and that he was going to come back to life and that it was going to happen on a certain time frame and then Matthew 28 is holding it out as though it all happened and there's a bunch of evidence for it and a whole lot of people saw it. Like, it's just you just can't read a document like that and then not do something with it. The obvious question when you get to the end is, well, do you think that happened? That's the point of our conversation today is that no matter who you are and no matter where you're coming from and no matter why you're here and why you're going through this process with me, then just thank you again, no matter who you are or why you're here, by the way, it's still going to come down to that question, right? If you're a Christian, you're going to get to the end of this and you're going to be like, well, yeah, I think he came back to life and that's pretty compelling and it affects me this way and it affects my decision-making this way. If you get to the end and you're like, I don't know and I can't decide, but if he did, that would have these implications. And if he didn't, I suppose status quo, if you get to the end and you're like, yeah, I just, it's too long ago, I don't know, that just doesn't happen. It's a beautiful story with beautiful teaching, but that's just a bridge too far. I can't go there. Well, that will have implications too, but that's like the jillion dollar question that everybody's wrestling with. So all of that to say, no matter who you are, I know this. Sometimes it can feel like if the Bible says things were a certain way and you're not sure about it or you're not sure what to do with it, it can feel like you're in a fight with the Bible. The Bible says Jesus came back to life. Oh, man, that's tough for me. I don't know. It can feel like, well, well, then the Bible's confronting you and you're in an argument with the Bible and the Bible just kind of uncaringly says how the things are and you can take it or leave it kind of like that angel in Matthew 28 verse seven, where he's like, now I have told you there. That's how the thing is. But as we're here at this super pivotal inflection point in the whole story, having done all of this work together to try to understand it and give this thing the most informed, careful, slow burn read that we could possibly muster. I think it's worth pausing to note for just a second that I think Matthew is actually really empathetic to all of us regardless of where we are. I don't feel like he's framed this thing like it's a fight, maybe a little bit with the religious leaders, the people who were alive right then and who were the murderous enemies of Jesus, but everybody else. It's persuasive, but it's empathetically persuasive. Think about all these details that he keeps providing. Every big bold claim is chased by some nod to a witness or somebody the original audience could have gone and looked up. There's a self awareness about the processes and the obvious questions that any reasonable person of any level of education at any point in history would look at a story like this and be like, okay, all right, hang on a minute. Now I got a couple of questions like, is this maybe just an argument from silence? I mean, all you're telling me is that we're missing a body. That's just the most logical explanation is somebody just moved a body that's more likely than somebody coming back to life. Like I would need to see Jesus. Well, Matthew is setting it up so that you get to wrestle with that question. Is this just an argument from silence fallacy, but he's going to chase it with the stuff we look at next time around with Jesus physically showing up and actually talking with these women. Now, I think no matter who you are and whatever you happen to be wrestling with right now, we don't do it the same order. We don't all wrestle with the same stuff all the time. I mean, heck, I know there's some of you who are listening to this who go to church and you don't really have anybody you can even tell that you have questions about this and you almost feel like you're living this double life of kind of keeping up appearances. But questions like, did Jesus rise from the dead and is this all true? That kind of eats at you a little bit. I feel you on that. But even if you are that person, I think it's both reassuring and just fair to what we have on the page here into the guy who wrote it down to acknowledge that there is a sensitive touch to this. We're being shown highly abnormal things, but it's always bookended by checkable reason, by something that is designed to say, Hey, I understand what question you might be asking here. This bit of information will speak to that and help you think that through further. There's a patience and there's an empathy to the way Matthew has crafted this. And maybe this is my sixth time through trying to read it carefully over the course of my lifetime each time in a very different place in life. However, many times it's been reading it carefully. I've probably skimmed it more times than that. They're all different. And somehow Matthew, Christians like me would believe inspired by the Holy Spirit. That's how we got it. So right has put together this accounting of the life of Jesus and the big pivotal moment here at the end that has resonated with where I've been at on each one of those passes. And if you're still here, I guess it's doing the same with you. So there's kind of a long game to this thing. And I'd be a total hypocrite if I were like, no, it's not just think the right things and then be religious the right way. But I don't know. That hasn't been my journey. I've received tremendous benefit from responding to this text over the course of my lifetime. And that degree of patience and empathy that's built in is something that is standing out to me even more this time around because you're here in the room with me. And I know so many of you are in a different place this time through than I am this time through. Thanks for gaming this out with me. And thanks for overlapping with me right now. Even in totally different places, we're still in the same place, so to speak as well, looking at the same words on the page, processing it at the same moment in history. I think that's a pretty special thing. And a pretty oddly unifying thing even if we come to different conclusions or we're in different spots in how we process it. Pretty big stuff next time around with Jesus actually showing up on screen and dismissing the argument from silence fallacy accusation that could be there. There's just no body. That doesn't prove anything. Well, now he's going to be here and he's going to be talking to people and it's pretty cool stuff. I'll see if I can crack more fart jokes next time around. I think it's important to get a few more of those in. This was awfully serious. Alright, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
