You're trying to relay to somebody else that certain things were said and it's outrageous and you should be outraged. And then the other person's like, well, what exactly did they say? Like, well, it's, I mean, I don't remember exactly, but it was how it came off. I mean, if you had been there, you would feel the same way I do. It was bad. Like, okay, so tell me again, what were the details? Well, this, this, this and this. Okay. And they said all of those things. Well, they basically said all of those things. I mean, that was the clear takeaway. Okay. But what did they for sure say that we know for sure? And then if you're on the receiving end of that conversation, you're the one whipped into a hysterical frenzy that can be really embarrassing when you didn't really quote everything right and you made emotional decisions as the conversation and question was unfolding. And then you went and tried to relay it to somebody else and they were calm and they demonstrated that maybe you didn't hear it quite right because emotion clouded your judgment and your ability to listen. But every now and then you have a conversation like that and a good friend in your life who helps you avoid making catastrophic mistakes is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. What did they actually say though? And you're like, oh, it wasn't even a verbal conversation. It's in writing here. Here's the communication right here. And then they look at it and they're like, Oh, dang, dude. Wow. Wow. That's a lot. Yeah, they did say that, didn't they? Huh? Okay. Well, what are you going to do? See, it can go either way there. And I think it's just a good reminder when you have conversations that go either of those directions, the type where you get checked a little bit and realize that maybe you didn't hear everything that was actually said or can't account for it and the type where you got the receipts and no, sure enough, that is actionable and we need to do something about both of those to serve as a great reminder for all of us, for me in particular, that it's sometimes it's a real good idea to go back and look at the source material that we're reacting to, say, okay, exactly what is it that happened here that might need to be addressed. And that is what we're going to do today with this situation in the book of Esther. You got a deal where there was a decree that was made, but for you and me, that's a long time ago. I'm in somewhere. I want to three, four. It's four pages in my Bible, but you've hung out with me for a while. Four pages is months for you and me. So at least for me, I kind of feel whatever it was that Heyman and Xerxes cooked up about the edict to kill all the Jews back there in chapter three, but I might not remember the exact specifics. So we're just going to go back and check and then we're going to think about what it would take to undo that or to countermand that so that we have a good sense of what would be a sane, responsible, accurate response to the actual decree that was made in the first place. I mean, we're in right now in Esther chapter eight and Heyman is defeated, the guy who's the architect of this plan to kill the Jews and Esther's richest woman in the world. Mordecai is going to administer that estate. He's got the signet ring of the king. Everything is shifting in favor of team good guys here, but the edict still stands. So Esther pleads with the king. Now she's starting to lose her cool or maybe she has her cool and this is a calculated way to work over the king and appeal to his emotions and weaknesses. She fell at his feet and wept. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman, the Agagite and the king sends the gold septor and then she says, if it pleases the king and if he regards me with favor and thinks it is the right thing to do and if he's pleased with me, let an order be written over ruling the dispatches that Haman son of a madot of the Agagite devised and wrote to destroy the Jews and all the king's provinces for how can I bear to see disaster follow my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family? And then as we've discussed, Xerxes is like, cool. Yeah. Well, because Haman did that, I gave you his estate and hung him on the gallows and maybe there's a pause right there and he can see that isn't what Esther wanted. That doesn't address the concern. And so what would make sense for him to offer next is the question that's hanging there in Esther 8, 8, no pun intended on the word hanging. So let's go back and see what was actually said in the first place. What was the deal? All right. So the king took his signet ring from his finger. This is Esther 3, what are we at? 10. He gave it to Haman, the son of a madot of the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. Keep the money. I don't want your dirty money and do with the people as you please. So that's as far as Xerxes knows anything about it. Everything from here on out is Haman on autopilot verse 12. Then on the 13th day of the first month, the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people, all Haman's orders to the king's satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. All right. So we got receipts as written down. We know exactly what this thing says. There's not going to be a debate about, wait, no, well, I mean, let's do this. Okay. Let's talk about what the actual decree was. No, no, no, we know what the actual decree was. It's all written down. This all happened in plain sight and lest there be any confusion, it was in all the languages. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring. Note how much the author of Esther is going out of their way to say this was very official and super documented. And verse 13, dispatch as were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to here we go, destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews, young and old, women and little children on a single day, the 13th day of the 12th month, the month of Adar and to plunder their goods. And then verse 14 says, I copy of the text and it was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality. So they would be ready for that day. Okay, there's not a lot of debate here. The order is to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews, which Jews, all of them, the young, the old, the women and little children. It's really interesting when we went over this last time around, I think I was maybe even a little bit critical. I think the way I read the passage was like, oh, Haman's not a good author. Look at that. He keeps repeating things. But as I've worked more carefully through the book of Esther with you in the ensuing months, I'm coming to understand that. I think what's happening here is that this is the author's paraphrase and that the author is using this repetition technique as a way to really emphasize what was actually being said because Esther uses the same kind of language when she's explaining what's going on to Xerxes in chapter seven and chapter eight. So I think what we're actually getting here, I think it was wrong before, is not just a poorly written decree, but rather that the actual nature of the decree is just being pounded by the author of Esther so we can't miss it. You're to destroy, kill and annihilate. There's a triplicate that all means more or less the same thing, all the Jews. And as if that wasn't clear enough, which Jews, the young, the old, the women and the little children. So it seems like what the author is doing here is going out of his way to show the receipts and say, this was the decree. Let nobody come back and be like, what? No, it was just, it was a social punishment. It was a social experiment. No, it was kind of a just a false flag thing. No, he never intended for people to actually do it. He's making it really clear. The edict was explicit. It was in all languages and there's no misreading it. Now why would he feel the need to do this? One, maybe to make the heroes look good. Mordecai and Esther, you want to make them look good and like they're doing the right thing. Maybe more so. It's because at some point there was a temptation for public sympathies to shift from, oh my goodness, were we really just going to use the government to kill all the Jews and anybody who wanted to volunteer to just participate in that on the day this was to happen could just jump in and they would get free money and stuff. Whoa, what have we become? This is insane. Remember, this didn't sit well with Susa because the very end of the chapter here, chapter three says that the couriers were out and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa and then the king and Hamis had down a drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered. This didn't make moral sense to people. So the sympathies in the interim between here and the events of chapter seven and chapter eight are going to be with the Jewish people. It would appear according to the author, but I can't help but wonder if when the Jews pushed back against their enemies and their enemies were on the run, which is what we're going to get to here a little bit later on, I can't help but wonder if public sympathies started to shift and people were like, no, no, no, no, that's too much. You can't do that. Or even if people who were absolutely pro genocide and absolutely wanted this kind of evil and violence to occur, suddenly they're embracing a new moral paradigm and being like, what, no, the humanity, you can't do things like, come on, stop it. And so to me from the 10,000 foot view, it looks like the author of Esther, who's obviously writing this after all of these events had unfolded, is going a little bit out of their way to defend that, no, this was a real threat. It was official. Don't let anybody memory hold this or gaslight you into thinking it was something different. This is what Haman ordered with the king's signet ring, whatever language you speak, you read the order. This is what it was. And we all know, dang, well, that that order wouldn't have been issued if there weren't a bunch of people who were perfectly enthusiastic to comply with that order. Again, this is so interesting. It's like the edict at the beginning of the book of Exodus to drown all the Hebrew babies where the idea was, who's going to carry it out? Soldiers and stuff? No, not really. We're just going to have the populace do it because there's plenty of people within the populace who if they know there's no punishment for this, it's even encouraged. You might get some free money or something that they would be enthusiastic about carrying out atrocities against Jews and specifically against Jewish babies. Same kind of deal here. There apparently is a whole subset of people under the authority and purview of Persia who would love the opportunity as long as there was some regal guarantee that there's no risk to them, that there's no physical risk to them for killing the Jews. There's no financial risk. There's no punitive legal risk to them. It is open season. It is a field day for just one day or one series of days or whatever it's going to be. You get a free pass to do whatever you want and you get whatever money you can harvest from this violence. So when we go back and look at the receipts that the author of Esther is holding up very boldly in front of us, what we are seeing is that no, it was every bit as bad as we were vaguely remembering. And if anything, it's very helpful and healthy to go back and remember just how dire this threat was and to see that there were people at the highest levels of government who were completely cool with this kind of violent madness happening on this appointed day. And apparently there were people throughout the empire who were perfectly delighted at the opportunity to comply consequence free. So sometimes you have a conversation with somebody and you're following up on a crazy thing that somebody else said and you're like, they said crazy stuff and then you get pushed on and they're like, yeah, but did they actually say that? And you're like, well, I mean, I'm a sort of, but you discover, now you're worked up and you're exaggerating. Other times something crazy happens and you go to somebody like this person that said crazy stuff and they're like, well, did they actually say it? And you're like, yeah. And here it is in writing. And that's the case. Well, now it's time to think about whether there's anything that you need to do to get things straightened out. And now you and I have gone back and done our due diligence and revisited exactly what this edict was about. As we glance at the rest of Esther, we see now there was no mistake here. This is reflective of Heyman's behavior. You can double check and see about the deal when Mordecai communicated all of this to Esther. Yeah, the details of what Mordecai communicated were accurate as well. Be corrected him. The court officials, the Unix, they didn't correct him. No, no, no, the receipts are there. The whole thing checks out. So this thread is real. It's every bit as violent and horrible as we remembered. We're not exaggerating here. We're not given to wild hysterical emotionalism. There's a real problem. And the real problem is getting really close. And now Esther has the king's attention and team Esther and Mordecai are going to have to figure out how to get something out of the king that can undo this. We'll see what it is next time around as we get into Esther 8 verse 8. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
