It opens with that character being attacked in the cradle. They're not obviously most famous. You got Jesus of Nazareth from the whole religion of Christianity is named. He gets attacked in the cradle by Herod the Great. You've got Sargon the Great from the distant past was attacked in the cradle and his mom saved him in a way that is reminiscent of Moses. Or maybe what happened with Sargon the Great, who would eventually become king of the Acadians, is the story that the mother of Moses had heard about when she put him in a basket. Both those kids, those future leaders of their people ended up in baskets. You think about Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, both of them ended up in the protective custody of somebody who was looking out for them and keeping them in the shadows while an evil king or emperor searched for them to destroy them. I don't remember a ton about Harry Potter. I watched movies that were fine or whatever. I don't know what I was fine. I just never got into it that much. But I think Harry Potter gets attacked in the cradle as well. It's a really common motif is the point and when you, oh, Willow, oh my goodness. Yeah, there's there's Willow. There's a Disney Plus version of that that just came out like a series eight or 10 episodes. It was ghastly. It was so bad. It got taken down after like three months or something. But the original one, they came out when I was a little kid. I loved that show and that show was a pinch zoom in on what is normally just a prologue. The whole show was about little baby, Laura Dan and how Willow and an unlikely group of protectors were stepping in to save her from an evil queen who wanted to destroy her because she was the prophesied one who would deliver her people. Oh, that was a good example. I should have just opened with that one. Well, whatever I didn't. Now the point is that this is a very common motif throughout all of time across cultures. And if you didn't know how the book of Esther worked out and you just started to read through it and you're like, okay, Esther chapter one. Oh, wow, this is a dangerous court that we have here with King Xerxes. He's got a loose cannon. He's a whack job. And man, his wife sounds like she was really pretty, but there's danger when you're pretty and you're too close to King Xerxes. Look at how things worked out for her. And then you get into chapter two. And now the king is getting lonely again. He's wanting to have a new queen and a new lady around here like, Oh, here comes the cycle. The king's about to do something crazy. He's also very manipulatable again, lose cannon, look out for Xerxes when he starts thinking about the ladies. And oh, there's going to be a big new queen contest where they go and round up all the girls from everywhere. Oh, no, you got to do something. Somebody needs to step in and protect some of these girls. And then you meet Esther and you're like, well, somebody has to do something. Like she's lovely in form and figure just like Vashti. Remember how things turned out for her? Here's what needs to happen. Okay, let me make sure I got this straight. This is, I think, again, still how you would be feeling. If you had never read Esther before, then you're used to storytelling beats, you would expect that what would happen next is he would find out that there wasn't the Citadel of Susa, a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai. Then against his will, his family had been taken there some time ago, so carried along on the current of history. Here he just happens to be now. And then there's an orphan. This is Esther girl and it's lovely in form and feature. She doesn't have a mom or a dad. She's vulnerable and particularly vulnerable because she's the kind of girl who King Xerxes would get interested in, but then who King Xerxes would use up and abuse. And doesn't it just feel like the next thing that should happen is that Mordecai or some unlikely band of protectors would need to come together, then wrap her up and hide her in a donkey cart or something and try to get past a couple of checkpoints to get out of there and escape and flee across state lines or go to some remote place and live like hermits and hide beautiful young Esther from this coming defilement that is going to happen for anybody who gets caught up in this thing. But we don't get that motif. It goes a completely opposite direction. So we hear about this Mordecai guy, Mordecai had a cousin named Dassa whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. We feel sympathy for her immediately. This girl who was also known as Esther was lovely in form and features. There we feel the danger. Oh, she's, I mean, can't put her around Xerxes. This guy's crazy around people who were lovely in form and features. And Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died and it just feels like right. The next verse verse eight will be, so when the king put out an edict proclaiming the beautiful girls from all across the land were to be rounded up and brought to the citadel of Sousa, Mordecai devised a plan to secretly escape with Esther to protect her from the king. But you don't get it. What you get instead is when the king's order and edict and been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Sousa and put under the care of Hegeai. Just to be clear, that's not Haggai, the prophet. That's H-A-G-G-A-I. This is Hegeai. That's a Hegeai. I don't know how to say it. H-E-G-A-I. This is a, a eunuch. This is the guy who's in charge of making everybody look pretty. Well, the next Bible verse says, says, it's a clarification. It says, Esther was also taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegeai who had charge of the harem. So already the story feels like it's going off the rails, especially if you've already been given a hint that Esther is going to be some kind of deliverer for her people. This isn't how that works. Now, I know that these story beats existed and we're familiar to the original audience. What we get here is our first real off-ramp, our first real surprise. And well, who's the blame for that becomes the natural question? Why isn't anybody protecting this girl from this horrible thing? We've talked about that a little bit over the last couple of days. If we go back and look at the language that's being employed by the author of Esther, we see that this author is trying to distract us from blame. This author is taking a tone of, hey, guys, things just happened. You don't need to get after Mordecai. You don't even really need to get after Xerxes. You don't need to get after this Hegeai guy. You don't need to get after Vashti or these advisors. Yeah, it's compromised, but things, they just happened. And that they happened is the important thing, not really who's to blame for how they happened. The important thing is that you just stick with me, the author seems to be saying, to get to the place where everybody just positioned where they need to be positioned for the story to go. And to do that, the author is employing a whole bunch of passive voice. Now, all of us know what passive voice is, even if you're not in the grammar, we intuitively can tell this. It's the blame voice. It's the voice that people use when they don't want to take responsibility for things. And so governments use this a lot when they screw up, right? Well, mistakes were made. There were omissions. Strategic missteps occurred. Bad intel was given. And you know, when you hear that, oh, well, that's that's government garbage speak for. Yeah, everybody now knows what we were doing and that that was a complete disaster, but I'm not taking the fall for this. And so it's just sort of the what does it matter approach where you just completely stiff arm a thing that went wrong. You just try to move forward with no accountability and the same people endlessly remaining in charge as the cabal that gets to make all the decisions for everyone else. We know this are sniffers detect the insincerity of that kind of use of passive voice where no one is described as being actually responsible for the thing. I hit my brother is very different than my brother was hit. But the author of Esther uses a ton of lightly passive or full on passive voice here. So you got a guy named Mordecai is from the tribe of Benjamin. He had been carried into exile or Kish. His grandfather had been carried into exile and we name who did it. It's Nebuchadnezzar, but the point is he was carried. All right. So that happens. And then some things happened to Esther. She didn't really pick it. Her parents died and someone chose to step up and look out for her applause. Nice job, Mordecai. But then we get really passive voice here in Esther to and verse eight when it says when the king's order and Edict had been proclaimed. So again, no one's really doing the proclaiming. It just gets proclaimed. Many girls were brought to the citadel of Sousa. Who does the bringing? Well I imagine a mix of really gleeful excited people, kind of like the sisters go into the ball and their evil mom in Cinderella who just couldn't wait to be there and try to pretty up and impress the prince or the king. I'm guessing that some of the people who brought these girls there were just like that. I'm guessing that some of the people were dirty awful traffickers who looked evil and who had evil angry hardened faces because long ago they had destroyed their consciousness doing this kind of thing at the bidding of powerful men and they were ripping young girls away from their family to take them to this bizarre pageant that would be a mix of people who wanted to be there and people who probably did not want to be there. But the author of the book of Esther is almost distracting us from that. Yeah, of course this would have been ugly, but that's not the point of the story. The point of the story is that by the current of circumstance or more clearly the way the author is presenting it, the current of God's providence, everybody just ended up here through evil means, through value neutral means, through good means, everybody just ends up in the positions they're in and it doesn't benefit the story or even for the purposes of the point of this story matter at all. How compromised the act of getting into position might have been. The point is we're in position now and what you need to know is that Esther is in danger because she's lovely and form and feature and she's in a court where that isn't necessarily a good thing for you. She's under the care of a unit who does not know her or care about her at all. She was taken there. That is she didn't necessarily go because she wanted to or didn't want to. It just happened to her for the purposes of the story. And now she's solo. Mordecai's not with her. Her mom and dad aren't with her. Nobody's with her. She's just a lovely young lady in a very difficult place. And that brings us to a place where we got to stop and acknowledge that this is a very different story than what we're used to. Anytime you get the typical prologue where there's an attack on the hero in the cradle, there is a very evil looking bad guy who is very active in doing that evil here. That's hand waved. There isn't really a snidey whiplash drooling evil character. There's a dangerous one in Xerxes who's a clumsy instrument that can be directed in multiple ways. And because of the way that's framed instead of focusing on revenge for the violation that happened to this poor young girl, the audience is instead. I'm primed to focus on how she's going to overcome these challenges and what opportunities might be present to do something forward thinking or good or redemptive once she does overcome these challenges. I think it's just a fascinating way to twist the story and build out the story and to put our heads in the right place as we turn the page to see what she does and how it works out when she finally does have the chance to meet the king. See on the first pass, it looks to the casual reader like this is a story about circumstance and things just kind of happening to work out. But upon closer examination, we see that no, Providence is the theme here. There's an unnamed God wielding more power to direct all of these things than the self-proclaimed king of kings who is very present and often named in the story. All right, I'm Matt.
