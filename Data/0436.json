I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and if I sound a little bit subdued today, it's because we got smoke rolling in from wildfires out here. And then apparently when you breathe, whatever is in the air, it just goes right into your lungs, I'm told. And then it can make your voice feel weird and raspy, which is how my voice feels today. If somebody came up to me and they were like, look, either you tell me what your favorite video game was from the last 15 years or my friends and I are going to punch you in the face repeatedly, I would choose the option where I tell them my favorite video game and I would pick Skyrim, which is a really cool open world beautifully put together role playing games, medieval feeling. It's set in a fictitious land that looks a lot like Sweden or Norway Viking culture kind of territory. And it's really fun. You travel all around this world and you find monsters and dragons and things. You get swords and you pick up items and well, the pick up items part is really, really important. That's how you earn money. It's how you make and craft new things that you need to clear the hurdles that are placed in front of you by the game. And so your inventory in this game is really, really important. You start playing, you're running around in the woods and you add a sword and you're picking flowers and you're grabbing fish out of the water and you're like, this is great. And then all of a sudden you pick up one thing like a sunflower seed and that puts you over some kind of weight limit that is all you're allowed to carry and your character slows down to this snail's pace and you can't fight and you can't move and it's miserable. And then you go in and you realize, oh, there's only so much that I can drag around with me and then it ruins everything. And even though it's realistic, it's maddening because a huge part of the game is going to get as much stuff as possible and hoard it like crazy. And so a few years later, there's some modders out there on the internet who made it so you could change the rules of the game in certain ways. And the first way I modded that game was to eliminate that carry capacity because I want all my stuff. I want to take it with me everywhere and I want to constantly be adding to my stuff. And in this way, your impulses as a player, when you play a game like Skyrim, pretty much exactly like the impulses that most of us have in real life. More stuff equals good. But more of it, have all of it and have it accessible as much as possible, seems like it's a pretty chief driving force in the motivations of most of humanity throughout most of history. But that impulse to define oneself by stuff and to hoard is something that is being vigorously pushed back on throughout the book of Matthew. And in particular, in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapter six, and again here in the passage we've been looking at in Matthew chapter 19, this is the famous story of the rich young ruler who strolls up to Jesus and is like teacher. And I said, do you do inherited eternal life? And Jesus is like, if you want to enter a life, obey the commandments and the kids like which ones. And Jesus is like, no murder, commit adultery, don't steal, don't give false testimony. Honor your father and mother, love your neighbors yourself. And the kids like, I've done all that. What else do I need to do? Jesus is answering. If you want to be perfect, go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you'll have treasure in heaven and then come follow me. When the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, I tell you the truth, it's hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again, I tell you, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. And the disciples hear that and they're like, well, who can be saved? And Jesus looked at him and tells him, with man, it's impossible, but with God, all things are possible. And then Peter replies, we've left everything to follow you. What's going to be left for us? And then we'll get to what Jesus said to that in a little bit. This rich young ruler wanted the unlimited carry, unlimited backpack size modification on life. He wanted to have all of his things with him and the prospect of giving them away even for eternal life, which is what he acknowledged he was looking for. He wasn't up for that. In other words, he ran the equation and he would rather have short lived life with lots of stuff than eternal life without all of his stuff. Well, so far in our conversation, we've mostly focused on this difficult question that was first made evident in Matthew chapter five. And that is the one the rich young ruler is asking, how does this work? How do I sign up? How much do I have to do? Your kingdom sounds great. Jesus, I'd like to be a part. Well, what do I need to do here? And we've seen a lot of failed attempts for people to offer their explanation of how that might work. And what we see Jesus saying in response to that question is that this is a really different equation, a really different transaction than anything else you experience in all of life. This isn't a normal deal because you're talking about the intersection between an infinite God who knows everything and can make anything he wants out of nothing and finite people. Finite people don't really bring much to the table in such a relationship. So this wouldn't be like a normal business transaction where both parties bring something the other one wants. Here the relationship by which a broken finite person would be invited into a kingdom operated by an infinite God can only be one born out of that God's power and that God's mercy. And that's a little difficult to compute for the disciples and for us. But Jesus goes on to assure them and us that by human effort, it's impossible. But with God, it is possible. But there's this additional layer of meaning here. And that's what I'm talking about with the whole Skyrim carry all your stuff thing that has to do not just with money, but with mammon. This term mammon is one that you will hear translated from time to time back in chapter six with all of the business Jesus says about treasures in heaven. I overshot by one page. Here it is. This is all the stuff about don't store up for yourselves treasures on earth where stuff breaks instead store that stuff up in heaven. And then he concludes the thought in Matthew 624 saying no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he'll be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. And a lot of times you'll see money even in modern translations capitalized. And that's indicative of some linguistic background here. The term once again for money being used in Matthew chapter six isn't really money. It's mammon and we don't have a neat single word corollary in English for what mammon means and all of the meaning that would have come with that. But it's not that tough to dig back in history and figure out what that word meant in the original language into the original mind. Now this is a word that transcended Syrian culture the Aramaic language Hebrew language Greek language. It sounds a little different in each of those forms. But in all of this it means worldly possessions stuff your backpack your inventory all of the things that you are dragging around with you. And particularly it describes stuff that might cause you to engage in worship or the giving of your heart to your stuff. The stuff no longer serves you you serve it. You no longer inflict a personal narrative or an identity on the props and things you use to do life. They inflict a narrative and an identity on you. And look I don't like give you the impression you've got to be some kind of scholar Bible genius to read between the lines and understand what's going on in the text in Matthew chapter six with this word that is usually translated money. It's entirely googable. I remember this coming up in seminary and reading it a few places. But literally I'm just in the Wikipedia article right now which is very interesting. It looks like the Greek word for mammon is spelled mamona. I think I'm pronouncing that Greek correctly. And it's looking like there are two manuscript traditions here with this word mammon. One of those which is the text behind most of your modern translations has only a single move in the middle of the word mammon. The other has a double move in the middle of the word mammon. And it would seem that the double move version of the Greek spelling of this is more proper. It's referring to maybe an ancient Syrian deity, the god of riches and wealth. I'm just quoting from the Wikipedia article here. But it looks like somewhere over the centuries this Syrian notion of an actual god of stuff leaked into Hebrew thought and Aramaic thought where this was more of an abstract concept than an actual personified deity or pagan god. That said it is not a fringe position. It is the center cut position. What Jesus means by what is often translated in the modern language as money. But what he means by mammon is more than just a big bank account or being rich in general. It is all of your aura of stuff, your whole backpack and what your orientation is to it. And that's backed up by the immediate context. You can't serve two gods. Obviously Jesus is saying God is the true God and that the false God, the rival cheap lesser God is stuff your inventory, your backpack. I want to keep working through this concept of mammon and being overburdened, having our inventory over full and how that paralyzes and how Jesus isn't trying to scam us out of our stuff. But instead to replace our stupid stuff, fake God with life and an actual God. Oh, I want to unpack that more. We're going to need another day to do it. I'm going to hit pause right here. We'll pick up right where we left off next time around a mat. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
