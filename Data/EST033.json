This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. We're going to talk about the Bill of Rights and civil liberties and things like that for just a minute. And I'm very excited to see if I can navigate that without it feeling like I'm picking some kind of political fight with people because that is not what I'm going for at all. But anytime you talk about the relationship between any government and any people at any point in history, I suppose that is politics, right? Let's do my best and we'll see what we get. We got this thing in the United States called the Bill of Rights. If you're from here, you've probably heard of it. I hope you've heard of it. If you're not from here, you might have heard of it as well because it's a pretty big deal in terms of the evolution of civics and government and the relationship between the state and the individual, the citizen. Well, there was a compromise that happened there in the late 1700s amongst the founding fathers to say, all right, we'll do the Constitution this way, but we want an immediate batch of amendments that limits the power of the government and that articulates certain freedoms, certain rights of the citizenry that are not given to people by the state. It's not by the good grace of the king that you're allowed to have opinions or say thoughts or worship God as you see fit or not worship God as you see fit. No, no, no. What we're trying to communicate with these Bill of Rights is this is by merit of you being a human that you have these particular liberties. So the Bill of Rights, these first 10 amendments is where you get freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, the right to bear arms, the right to keep. Keep your personal effects and not have the government just get to go through all of your stuff. There's a ton of things in there that are all very forward thinking. I mean, they were very forward thinking in the 1700s and it's been a pretty clumsy couple hundred years worth of execution on these Bill of Rights with at times these rights being withheld from people to whom it was a societally fashionable to discriminate. And at times these rights being withheld from people just across the board under the guys's of emergency or whatever else. So it's not a perfect track record, but on paper, this is a pretty cool batch of things. And all of the things when you go and look carefully at the Bill of Rights that are in there, they're all a pushback. They're all designed to be a check correction on the worst impulses of the state of Kings from ages past. And one of the places where that's really evident is in the 8th Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Now admittedly, there's a lot of debate about exactly what constitutes cruel and unusual. You can land wherever you land on how we've actually done in upholding this idea of cruel and unusual punishment. But I think what has to be acknowledged is that a lot of the most violent excess is when it comes to capital punishment from the history of ever really have been checked. But this practice of very clever, cruel, unusual public punishment as a deterrent, as a humiliation, as a clever, ironic counter action to whatever crime the person got wrong. This is an age old tradition of the state. And indeed, you and I have looked at some incredibly cruel and unusual punishments, even in our conversations here from the Greeks and the Romans and the Persians. And well, one of those that comes from the Persians is something we're going to be looking at today. And all this cruel and unusual punishment stuff, it's interesting. It's certainly the stuff that gets your attention and you remember it when you read about history. But if it was actually happening in your world or to people you knew, I don't think it'd be quite as fun or entertaining as well. I mean, it's really just, it's quite the flex on the part of the state and it's quite the way to remind people of who's actually in charge around here. And in Ezra chapter six, we see one of these excesses in writing that that 8th Amendment of the United States Bill of Rights is trying to push back on. We see an order of cruel, unusual punishment that is established by the decree of Darius. These decrees, as we've been talking about, are binding from these Persian kings and they are precedent setting in Persian law and Persian expectation. We know that Darius's reign was one that was always in question, always nipping at his heels. He was paranoid about it. We know that he was one who was want to dish out brutal punishment in a very public way to send a message to people. For example, Herodotus, the Greek historian tells us that one of the seven co-conspirators who helped Darius become king in the first place by killing Bardiad, the son of Cyrus, the second Cyrus, the great, or if you're to believe Darius' inscription on that mountain in modern day Iran, the magician shapeshifter who made himself look like Bardiad. I think he'll party. Oh my gosh, that'd be, I can't even imagine that's unconscionable. I didn't do that. No, I know what it looks like, but that's because the guy was a magician shapeshifter and he shapeshifted to trick all of you. So I just killed that guy with a heavy heart on now become king. That was his narrative, of course. So this guy's always paranoid and he's got to dish out some ugly punishment, including as I was saying to one of his seven co-conspirators. What's the guy's name? It ends in affernies because they all end in affernies back then into affernies, I think was this guy's name. And there's a deal where Darius is like, all right, you were going to pick me to be king. I'm going to be king. And the deal is all of you will have access to the throne unfettered. You can come in any time you want and have access to the throne of the great king of kings, the king of Persia without me having to give you some sort of acknowledgement. You can just come in there unless I'm with a woman and if I'm with a woman, well, then you're going to be told to get awake because I'm like, I'm doing something right now. And apparently, into affernies at some point early in Darius's reign, he got to be in his body. I'm not honoring this stupid rule anymore. I made you king. I could probably unmake you king. I don't know if you said any of that. And so he goes there to the palace of Darius and there are a couple of guards outside Darius's chambers and he's like, I got to see the king. And they're like, yeah, he's, I mean, there's a lady in there right now. So you're going to have to wait. And apparently, according to Herodotus, he's like, I'll show you two rascals and he cuts off their noses and their ears. And then he ties them together with the whip or a cable or something. And then he goes and he rides away and he's like, go tell Darius whenever he's available again that I came to see him and I'm irritated that we couldn't. And he goes and tells him in Darius is like, what the heck? I think we're probably at risk of a full blown revolt here. I mean, if these guys would regicide with me, they'll regicide on me. So he sends a note to all of the other conspirators and they're like, what? No, that wasn't us. I, you know, I wouldn't cut off any noses. We only want to call it a thing. But he's knows like we wouldn't bother you. We know you were with some. That's fine. No, no promise on us. He's like, all right. Round up the family of into fernies and he doesn't just kill into fernies. We're like wipes out the guy's entire lineage. And I'm not exactly going to spell it out for you. But if you go and you read through the Bill of Rights, you'll see that this one violates a lot of them, probably including the whole cruel and unusual punishment thing. Obiously very early on in the Persian era of Babylon, according to the book of Daniel, we see some cruel and unusual punishment. What? Like you're doing the, you're praying to the wrong thing or whatever over here. They find we're going to feed you to a bunch of lions for entertainment. So I mean, that would count, I think is the violation of the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution as well. But we get another one of those in Ezra chapter six and all of this is so relevant to how things are about to play out in the book of Esther. So there's this letter that we looked at yesterday where Darius found that decree from Cyrus and he's like, all right, indeed, this whole project in Jerusalem is supposed to be happening. He writes the letter back. It's going to be funded. It's going to go. And then here's the end of the letter. I didn't read you yesterday from Ezra six and verse 11. Furthermore, this is Darius. I decree that if anyone changes this edict, a beam is to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it. And for this crime, his house is to be made a pile of rubble. May God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence. Now, look on the one hand there, you're rooting for the Jews so hard here at this point in the Old Testament. You want to see them put it back together, get this temple built. You want to see those prophecies about the redemptive plan and all of that story. You want to see that get momentum again. You want to see redemption here. So you might be tempted to gloss over this. I don't know how could anybody blame you if you do because it just feels like such a triumphant moment. Ha ha. Anybody who goes against Jews is going to get impaled. Take that. When you really think about it, it's kind of freaky because any throne that has the power to say just, oh, wait, wait, wait, one second, Ted, before we wrap up that letter, raise the love, Darius, raise that. Add this part about some stuff about like a beam and impaling people and pile of rubble. I want it to sound serious. Read that back to me. Oh, yeah, that's great. Hit send. I love that. Any government that has the teeth to be able to do that to your enemies has the teeth to be able to do that to you. Now, why would Darius be so eager to flex his muscles and dish out crazy punishments? Well, he's trying to be a real boy. And for the same reason that he cracked down on into fernies. So he's looking to crack down on anybody who would reject the decrees of the king. And he's not just trying to prop up his own decrees, as we've discussed, but the idea that once the throne has made a decree, that is it. Now, I know there's some of you who have not looked ahead into the book of Esther at all. Maybe you've never read it. Maybe you've never looked at it. And you're like, why are we going to get there? The answer is very, very soon. I know there are some of you who have looked ahead into the book of Esther and you're already connecting the dots that I'm about to quickly connect right here. The idea of somebody being impaled on a beam that is of their own possession is really going to factor into the story of Esther. The idea of a king who sits in the exact same seat, the exact same throne, in fact, has the exact same last name as Darius, making a decree and then not really being able to just unmake it for all kinds of political legal reasons within the Persian system. That is going to factor very heavily into the book of Esther. So how do we get there? It was just a vacuum. One day we woke up and these were all the ground rules and the king of the book of Esther, he was insecure and he just had to make rules. And if he said something, even if he was drunk, it just counts. It's totally binding forever. And this stuff about cruel and unusual punishment and a king who is insecure enough in his standing in terms of his lineage that he might at any time be duped into or provoked into weaponizing his power against a group of people. It's fashionable to discriminate against, but also that power could be immediately pivoted on a dime to go after some other group of people. That didn't just happen overnight. All of those political, social conditions and expectations that make the story of Esther possible are born out of how Cyrus the Great defeated the Medes and became king of the Persians. How Cyrus the Great defeated the Babylonians. How Darius did what maybe actually needed to be done anyway in getting rid of a couple of very ineffective leaders and becoming king himself. How Darius did that and who he did it with and how that forced him to rule and do justice and be quick with cruel and unusual punishment. All of that stuff gets handed down to Darius's son, Xerxes, the king, the story of the book of Esther. And all of that stuff creates this environment that generates the stakes and generates the parameters that really create the tension in the book of Esther that the original audience would have known automatically, but the UNI have to do a lot of work to properly understand. And my friends, we've done that work. And I think we're getting to a place where it's going to be a lot easier for us to feel these stakes and to look at the plot beats of the book of Esther and not just say like, all right, that's a plot hole. That doesn't work. Why didn't you just have him do this? Well, just have him erase the thing. We'll just have him not do that. Well, now we're going to better understand why those things weren't options and why there was real tension here, including the dramatic high point of the entire story, which is when Esther has to walk in to the throne room, uninvited and hope that she is received with grace every single person who is here in the story of Esther in the original audience would have been very familiar with the fate of Interfernes and his family. And what happens if you cross one of these kings by going in unannounced when you are uninvited, it simply is not done. And I think the way all of that fits together is just hyper, hyper interesting. We're going to land the plane on a couple more details in Ezra and Nehemiah, but we're pretty much done with what we need to get out of these stories for the moment. And then we're into the age of Esther and the book of Esther itself. Should be fun. Y'all are awesome. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
