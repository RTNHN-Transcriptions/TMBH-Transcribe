Today we finished Matthew 10, which we've been working on for months. Hasn't been months, it's been a long time. Whatever the case, the high five feather in the cap, it's a lot of work to process through an ancient document together. And every time we take a big chunk and get that in our hip pocket, that's just one more bit of the most influential book in the history of all time, dealing directly with the words of the most influential person in the history of all time, that we've got on lockdown, or at least, maybe lockdowns a little generous, at least, that we have more clarity on than we did before we walked into it. So thanks for putting in the time and the effort with this. On the one hand, Matthew 10 has been tricky because Jesus is talking about different periods of time. He's talking about the trip that his 12 disciples are going on right now. He's talking about what it's going to look like for them later in life as they continue to do this, and he's talking about the whole grand enterprise of people throughout the centuries of the future going out with this message. There are things that are specific to this one particular trip out, like the unique equipping with the, no, what is it again? I can't remember the list exactly. The healing of the sick, raising of the dead, cleansing of those who have leprosy and driving out demons. Jesus gives the disciples that authority in chapter 10, but we don't see everybody wielding that authority in the future, so that's a specific moment thing. It's also tricky because it looks like there's a lot of pretty hot language in here about judgment for people who don't recognize that the disciples have in fact been sent out by the true king of the true kingdom by God in the flesh. And if they miss that, well, Jesus language is harsh. And if they get that, the language is, hey, you get the same reward that the people who brought you the message get. So it just takes a while to unpack and get these things into all their proper logical categories or else Matthew 10 can turn into a quagmire and a mess that can get us into a lot of things that I don't think Jesus is actually saying. The ebb and flow is really evident throughout Matthew 10. And we touched on this just a little bit yesterday. It's a back and forth between positive stuff and scary stuff and encouraging stuff and warnings about stuff. And hey, I got you kind of language and also, hey, other people are going to be pretty hard on you physically kind of language. You remember when you learned how to swim, whoever taught you, your swimming teacher, your mom, your dad, your grandfather, sister, whatever, maybe you don't know how to swim in which case this is going to fall really flat. But if you know how to swim, somebody taught you and eventually they would do the thing where you would part ways with the pool wall and you would part ways with their hand. But where would they have their hands when you were doing that? Like one inch from your rib cage, right? I'm right here. I'm right here. Nope. Keep kicking. You're freaking out. And then after that, they'd back away from you a little bit and they do the, all right, just come to me and you're heaving and freaking out a little bit and you're spitting up a little bit of water, but you are kind of moving closer to them and you are doing better than you did before because they took their hands off. And you feel like if anything gets weird, mom, dad, whoever, they're within arms reach and they are going to resolve this thing, they're not going to let me drown, but I definitely need to learn how to swim. That's what Matthew 10 feels like throughout. This constant reassurance that every time the speech might have somebody feeling like they're a little bit too far from the wall or a little bit too far from those strong hands that know what to do in the water that, okay, no, but the hands are right here. The hands are right here. You're still good. No, no, no, keep swimming. You got this thing. And so I love that in this passage that has a lot of pretty intimidating, weighty language, you've also got tucked away in it. This idea of Jesus of a God who really does care about the well-being of the people he's sending out and he cares about comforting them. And he's not just really sending them out to the wolves unequipped. I mean, yeah, I'm sending you out to the wolves, but also I'm with you. And he reiterates this in Matthew chapter 28, the very last thing we're going to get in the whole book is Jesus giving not the lesser commissioning, which is what we get with that sheep and wolves commissioning in Matthew 10 here, but the great commission, the one about go and make disciples of all nations, the one that is the completion of the Abrahamic covenant that the blessing is going to go out to everybody. And at the end of that, you remember what he says? He says, and I'm with you always until the end of the age. So even after all these experiences and all the years that pass between Matthew 10 and Matthew 28, you're still seeing a Jesus who deeply cares about the people he's sending out, deeply cares about the people he's sending them out to and wants to reassure them at every turn. I'm with you. You got this thing. Come on. It's tough, but you got this. And both as someone who has great parents and aspires to be a great parent as well, I resonate with that language. I value that language on the very personal level. So there's your 10,000 foot view of Matthew chapter 10, and that leaves only one glaring question remaining. And that's how did it go? So we pick it up at the beginning of chapter 11. And it says, after Jesus had finished instructing his 12 disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. Wait, wait, what? Okay. Verse two looks like a whole new thing. When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him, or you okay, that's a whole other story. What? So he gives them all of these instructions and we get this whole buildup about this great big open world quest. And then presumably they went and did that a little bit. But all we ever really hear about is that Jesus just kept on doing whatever it is that he'd been doing the whole time. He went around in Galilee and he preached and he taught. All right. We got other gospels though that tell the same story. And so we're going to go and find out from somebody else how this thing worked out. Mark chapter six, it's in the first part of Mark six. It is not in the first part. Second section of Mark six says, okay, same thing. And Jesus went around teaching from village to village calling the 12 to him. He sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits. All right. This sounds like the same story, the parallel thing that we're looking at in Matthew chapter 10. That's interesting. The two by two detail. We don't get that from Matthew. These were his instructions, take nothing for the journey except a staff. Take no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. We're sandals but not an extra tunic. Whoever or wherever, rather you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off of your feet when you leave is a testimony against them. Okay. It sounds just like the stuff from Matthew 10 14 says, then they went out and preached that people should repent. They drove out many demons and anointed many people with oil and healed them. Okay. So we're getting some details here. They went out and they did the stuff they were supposed to do. It's good to know they preached that people should repent. I guess that fits with the Matthew 10 simple message that Jesus sent them out with. The kingdom of heaven is near. That might sound like a different message, but in Matthew chapter three, when John is throwing out that message, it clearly comes with the idea of repentance. You repent for the kingdom of heaven is near. In other words, you quit going after the kingdom of the world because the kingdom of heaven is at hand. So you go after that. Okay. That checks out. They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. Oh, so the stuff that Jesus said they were going to be able to do according to Mark, they were able to do on this exact trip. Let's see if it keeps going at all. Verse 14, King Herod heard about this for Jesus name had become well known. Some were saying John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. Okay. It gets us into the John the Baptist stuff again, just like it does in Matthew chapter 11. That's the next anecdote, but Mark connects the dots between the sending out of the 12 and Herod's agitation. Because Herod hears about the reputation of Jesus, which has become according to him well known in Mark chapter 6, 14. He finds out about the name of Jesus in his bigger reputation, presumably because the 12 were effective. Interesting. All right. Now we're going to bounce over to Luke chapter 9. Starts in verse 1, Luke 9, 1, when Jesus had called together the 12, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them out to teach or preach rather the kingdom of God and to heal the sick and he told them don't take any of the stuff. He's supposed to go to villages. The whole dust off the feet thing is all there. So they set out and went from village to village preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere. Okay. So quick version of what we get with Mark and again, a little bit more than we get from Matthew in terms of the results. They went out, they did it, stuff worked. Interesting that what Matthew wants us to know is that Jesus went out and kept preaching. It's almost like Matthew is trying to hit that theme that Jesus is the point. Jesus is the king a little bit harder because of the king motif throughout Matthew, whereas Mark is trying to give us probably Peter's recollection of events. It's going to be more action focused and you're going to see a little bit more emphasis at times on the disciples getting after it. No surprise there. Luke is trying to author a vindication account of Jesus. That seems to be his first priority that Jesus is the son of God, that Jesus is innocent, that he was wrongly executed. So it makes sense that he would just give us the details and move on. But Luke does move us right into Herod as well. Now Herod the Tetrak heard about all that was going on and he was perplexed because some of them were saying, John is raised from the dead and we get into the John thing again. So Luke, like Mark directly connects the commissioning, the open world quest of the 12 to Herod's agitation and what happens with John the Baptist, whereas Matthew just stacks those details next. The 12 disciples are meant to evoke the idea of the 12 tribes of Israel. This is very symmetrical with the idea of the Abrahamic covenant that we've talked about a lot and God telling Abraham that his descendants would be many and that ultimately they would be blessed and a blessing to all the nations. So the 12 disciples, the new family of faith that Jesus is creating, they go out as maybe some sort of reminder of the 12 tribes and in doing so, round out or help with the fulfillment of part of that Abrahamic covenant, which is the whole direction and impulse of the Old Testament and New Testament together, that is that God is redeeming everything and isn't that really what the whole missional discourse is about? It's not about proselytizing and being pushy and obnoxious with your religion. It's about a God who according to the text saw things that he made and said they were great and then whether it's human freedom or God's sovereign plan or some mix of the two people screw it up sin failure. And shortcoming imperfection is introduced into a perfect system and then rather than burning the whole system down, God goes on this big redemptive quest to make the whole thing better over a very long period of time with Jesus being the centerpiece of that redemptive plan and Jesus, the weirdly and shockingly picking 12 randos from around the northern Sea of Galilee to send out to be representatives of his kingdom and the values of the kingdom and of him as the king in order to communicate to people, this is the truest, realist thing and to see this little tiny nugget of kingdom start to grow up into this much bigger, gianter thing that is the truest, realist, most beautiful thing ever. And Matthew chapter 10 is a hyper important part of the unfolding of that whole redemptive plan. Hey, that's another chapter done by friends high five onto 11 tomorrow. I'm Matt.
