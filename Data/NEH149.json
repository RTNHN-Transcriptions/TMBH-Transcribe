It's the book of Nehemiah. Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and I don't think we've ever talked about this before but my plan coming out of college was to be a lawyer. I took the LSAT, that's the fancy test you take when you want to go to lawyer grad school to law school and I got into some cool law schools and I went to one of those and I did a law internship but about that time, it occurs to me, I don't know that we've talked about this very much either. My kid brother died which that's a longer conversation. I miss him. That was a very pivotal, obviously emotional but very pivotal moment for me and for my whole family. And so I moved away from where we were living for law training and all of that stuff and I came home and I guess I never really looked back. That was it for me in doing law stuff except for one little moment where I helped a buddy of mine start an estate planning law firm and it's still going. He's doing great. He didn't really actually need my help but it was very fun working with him and helping him out in the early days of that law firm. And I remember very distinctly that there were two kinds of people who would come in. There would be the people who had no plan but the fact that they were going to die someday just recently occurred to them and they were pretty frantic about things. Those weren't the most enjoyable meetings because there was all kinds of tension. I mean you're dealing with all kinds of moving parts and money and all of this stuff but also you're impending death of a person. I mean it's a lot to think about but then you have other people who would come in and these were really fun meetings because they had a plan. It had occurred to them that they were going to die a long, long time ago and they had been adjusting to that and building a whole system of things to make stuff work and to have their wishes honored after they were gone. And they'd been building into their relationships informally with no paperwork or anything for years and years and years and years and these kind of people tended to be a really very at peace. And really if you want to have any say in what happens after you're gone a plan is probably about the best you can do. Ultimately that doesn't guarantee that what you hope happens is totally going to happen. Things change stuff that seem valuable in one generation don't in the next I don't know lots of it's the world right we all understand how this goes. The best you can do is put together a really good plan and the better the plan the better the chance of the thing that you figured out in your lifetime you know the better your plan the better the chance of that thing is going to stick and be a blessing to future generations the way it was a blessing to you. Nehemiah as we have discussed so much was a dude with a plan he figured something out he figured out what it was to have a repentant heart not just for himself but for the whole mess he was willing to take ownership of the whole mess all the stuff that had gone wrong with his people in the Old Testament he just owned it and from that posture and from his competence and from by his own words the blessing of God he was able to go and accomplish something truly incredible he didn't just rebuild a city and it sort of seems like that was going to be the whole plot of Nehemiah we got to rebuild those walls and fend off the enemies but we discover as we go along to the book of Nehemiah that really what he was trying to do was rebuild a people the wall is a metaphor the wall is a necessary accomplishment to give him a chance to achieve the thing he really needs to achieve which is rebuilding a people and that's cool to do for one generation but how do you make it stick and in the latter part of Nehemiah the part that maybe you and I could be tempted to imagine is the boring girl part what we get is really actually the juicy part this is the high stakes part because guess what pretty much every wall that was built in the mid-fifth century BC is not in very good shape right now if it can even be identified at all walls come and go buildings come and go but people groups and the values and the beliefs and faith in God well that stuff can outlive rocks that stuff can outlive buildings and governments and achievements and Nehemiah was a very forward thinking guy who wanted to achieve stuff like that so really from chapter eight on where we get the reading of the law and everybody showing up for that and then the people repenting and then them all making a covenant together to say we're gonna live weird we're not going to do business on the Sabbath we're not going to intermarry with the people around us and adopt their customs and religion we can't mingle that with belief in the one true God and also we covenant to provide for all of these things that have to happen to make the life of the temple work all of that happens in chapter 10 then a bunch of people agree to move into the city and make it a thriving city where all of this will work and where the economy can function and then all the people in chapter 12 get positioned in all of the right places and then we spike the football the whole thing by having a big ceremony with two choirs and everybody celebrating together and confirming once again together that we are in on this thing and it is going to happen if you're Nehemiah what else can you do I mean I suppose you could go try to find some potion from some witch out in the desert that promises immortality so you can always be there to lead the people and make sure their behavior is good but I don't know it seems like the Bible frowns on that kind of thing so I guess he just figured well I'm gonna die like all the other people who die and hopefully this plan outlives me and really here at the beginning of Nehemiah 13 we get the end of Nehemiah's very successful very fruitful visit to Jerusalem where he served as temporary governor under the authority of Artaxerxes king of Persia in 444 BC there are some places by the way that say 445 a few others will say 443 there's a little bit of question based on how long the succession took to sort out between the death of Xerxes and the ascension of Artaxerxes so I think 444 is the best bet if you look in your Bible and they're saying 445 that's what that's about at any rate so here we are at the end of Nehemiah's time in 444 BC Nehemiah chapter 13 he's got to go back at some point and be the cup bearer to the king again so this is really what I'm about to read you the last of Nehemiah enacting his metaphorical estate plan so that things will turn out the way he believes they need to turn out even after he's gone Nehemiah 13 1 on that day the book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people wow so we're doing that again dang I mean that the bookends I use that term a lot bookends but the Bible uses the bookend technique a ton so here's another bookend Nehemiah 8 remember I mean it opened with the same thing when the seventh month came and the Israelites settled in their towns all the people assembled as one man and square before the water gate they told Ezra described to bring out the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded for Israel so on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest we say September 27th 444 BC brought the law before the assembly which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand he just read to them all day cool well apparently they were still interested in that this is awesome this all lends itself to Nehemiah's plan to rebuild the people so on his last day more or less there they're reading through the book of the law again they're hearing from Moses again but they catch something this time that maybe didn't pop for them quite as much the last time through as is often the case when you read the Bible I mean how many times have I read Nehemiah and how much stuff they had never thought about or never noticed of you and I caught together through this process so hey they're like us and this is what they catch Nehemiah 13 months on that day they're reading the book of Moses aloud and the hearing of all the people and there it was found written that no ammonite or moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God well why would that be verse two because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them our God however turned the curse into a blessing huh well this is sort of an interesting turn here at the end of Nehemiah's plan building and preparation to go back to work back east in the throne room of king artyserxes there's some real ugly rivalries in the Old Testament with neighboring people groups and even cousin people groups of the Hebrew people the Israelites the descendants of Abraham eventually called the Jews then some of these were ugly some of these divisions were indicative that now this people group straight up wanted to see the Jews eliminated remember the Amalekites or the Agagites were another group like this from whom Haman of the book of Esther fame was descended well these are two more the Ammonites and the Moabites these were people who tried to thwart what God was doing with his chosen people as they were coming out of the desert wandering toward the end of the desert wandering after the exodus and it got straight up written down that now they're a problem and they don't get to be admitted into the assembly specifically that detail is laid out in Deuteronomy 23 verse 3 no Ammonite or a Moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord even down to the 10th generation now apparently when this is all getting read Nehemiah 13 they went even beyond this provision because 10 generations had certainly passed since the offenses outlined as we read along a little further in Deuteronomy 23 verse 4 for they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Nahareem to pronounce a curse on you however the Lord your god not listen to Balaam but turn the curse into a blessing for you because the Lord your god loves you do not seek a treaty or friendship with them as long as you live okay so maybe that last line is what caused them to say the 10th generation thing was kind of just euphemism we should never admit the Ammonites or the Moabites into the sacred assembly and it seems like the crowd is like you know what that's kind of a metaphor that's sort of emblematic of what we've got wrong all along maybe we need to go to the extreme other end of the spectrum and just not admit anybody anymore instead of casually intermarrying with everything and adopting everybody else's ideas let's lean into these walls we just built and rededicated as a metaphor for how we're going to live period let's completely exclude everybody because it seems to be nothing but trouble that we get into when we do that verse three of Nehemiah 13 when the people heard this law they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent and that's it for the events of 444 BC and all that Nehemiah did there that's all we get it ends on that note a note that I think it's fair to say might be a bit of an overreaction because remember the initial covenant with Abraham and god that they're trying to restore and get back to is a covenant that says that they're going to be a blessing to all the nations so okay does that mean you need to marry all the nations well maybe not maybe they needed this degree of total exclusivity to do what they were supposed to do but it feels like there's maybe an impulse toward hunkering down and barrier ring up and neglecting that job of outreach neglecting that job of being a blessing to all the nations as well the jury's still out on that one either way Nehemiah was only here for a set period of time remember Artaxerxes suspected him back and now it's time for him to go back what we're going to discover I think is that Artaxerxes had probably moved his court at least temporarily to Babylon and so that's the trip that Nehemiah has ahead of him and this is the state in which he leaves things with a clear plan for what happens when he's gone but for the attentive reader I think we come away feeling really good about what we've seen over the last few chapters and maybe the slightest question mark about what we just saw there but I suppose we also come away thinking well let's see how Nehemiah's plan plays out when you don't have the gigantic personality and administrative talent and leadership courage of Nehemiah right there in the city overseeing everything and keeping everyone in line and next time around well we're going to find out how that worked out I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon", "segments":
