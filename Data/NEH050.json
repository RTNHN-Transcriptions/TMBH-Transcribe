I root for the University of Colorado buffaloes. I know that they have a coach that rubs people in the wrong way, but the heart wants what the heart wants. So even though I have great respect for the state of Nebraska and the people there love Nebraska, I still in a playful, friendly way. I just, I don't refer Nebraska. They're a natural enemy of my people. But you know who I don't care about at all? The Appalachian state. I just made that up. I don't care. I don't know anything about them. I have no lower. I don't know anybody who's ever played for them. I feel absolutely nothing. I'm absolutely nothing toward Appalachian state. As a Denver Nuggets fan, my natural enemy is the Los Angeles Lakers. Do I hate Los Angeles? No, come on. It's not like that. It's friendly, I think, but I don't want them to do well. I want them to fail. I'm more inclined to find their fans off putting. You know who I don't care about at all? The Toronto Raptors. I could probably name some people who played for them, but I don't care. I don't have any strong feelings whatsoever. Never a moment in my life. Not one drop of emotional energy has been squandered on the Toronto Raptors. As a Colorado Rockies fan, I have no known enemies because we are such a horrible franchise that there's no one who would even stoop to being willing to be called our rivals. So that example doesn't apply. Are you seeing the pattern here? Proximity is what makes rivalry happen. This isn't just a sports phenomenon. I'm sure you could run this whole list for yourself, teams. You super feel strongly negatively about teams you don't care about at all. But there's actually a name for this phenomenon. It was coined by an anthropologist named Susan Friend Harding. And this concept was first introduced to me in the book How to Think by Alan Jacobs, a great book. If you ever read that one, my goodness, do I ever highly recommend it? Jacobs quotes Harding talking about this concept of the repugnant cultural other. And what Harding is trying to communicate with this term is that people who are far, far away, they might have horribly misaligned values with you. You might, if you got a close look, really dislike everything about what they're doing. But simple geography puts them out of sight, out of mind, whatever. Maybe there's even an exotic charm to something that's far, far away and otherworldly. But instead, humans are more likely to react with great visceral negativity toward something that is actually much closer to sharing in the same values, but that is right next door. And there are a whole variety of reasons that such rivalries can exist. I think if you understand the concept of the repugnant cultural other, you're going to understand the rivalry between the Jews and the Samaritans better. Now, we figured out from looking at some contemporary historical records, the elephantine papayrai, dating to the 5th century BC. And then after the fact historical account from Josephus in the 1st century AD, we discovered that Sandblatt is Samaritan. He's associated with the Samaritan people. And there seems to be automatic bad blood that is assumed between the Jews and the Samaritans, really at pretty much every turn throughout the Old Testament and the New Testament. But because for most of us, this isn't our fight. We don't care. It's far, far away. I don't know. Everybody seems fine. I don't really feel strong emotions. Because of that, we got to dig a little deeper to make the character's behavior on screen in the Bible make any sense, because otherwise it just seems like a ridiculous rivalry. And we imagine we're loofed and above such things, but we're not above such things. As I indicated by expressing how much I irrationally revile certain sports teams that are actually good and with whom I probably share lots of values. Here's the deal. Nobody knows exactly when the Samaritans started. Now, the Samaritans are a remaining people group. They still exist. There aren't very many of them. The 900 is the most recent estimate that I've read, but they still exist and they still worship. And they say they have an unbroken chain of high priests going back 3800, 4,000 years to the priest Aaron, the first one, like the Aaron from the Old Testament, the Pentateuch. And they would say that whatever one they're on, that is the true high priest of high priests. They worship the true God of Abraham. They are the rightful holders of the baton of God's promises throughout history and all of that. And they would view very critically the Jewish people who they would say are false holders of the baton. Maybe I'm overstating it, but I don't think so. The Samaritan tradition says that Eli, the high priest in the Old Testament, hijacked the rightful lineage of priestly authority from his rivals and started moving the correct places of worship from where they should have been to other places. The accusation is even leveled that he made another arc of the covenant and that the whole thing is fake. So that rivalry, if that is to be understood as truly the Samaritan position, okay, well, yeah, that would be a pretty big rivalry. And that's a gigantic point of disagreement between these two parties. The Samaritans don't get mentioned in the Bible until 2 Kings, chapter 17. There's a nod in 2 Kings 17 to the Samaritan people being a distinct people and being conquered during the ninth year of King Hoshaya by Shamanesser, one of the bully kings of Syria. And then a little bit later on in 2 Kings 17, there's talk of the people from Samaria being resettled way, way far away near modern day Baghdad, Babylon in a town called Kutha. And Kutha by name is associated with the Samaritans in Josephus and other ancient sources. So we don't have much there, but it's a starting point. And then a little later on after the northern kingdom gets completely defeated by Assyria as well, there's a little bit of language there about the Assyrians leaving behind some people, even moving people in from different parts of the Assyrian empire. And there's this hint and a tradition that goes with it that some of the remaining people of Samaria intermingled with these Assyrian subjects who were moved into the area, and that is where you get the Samaritan people, that they didn't honor the bloodlines, their paperwork isn't right, unlike the Jews who returned during the time of Ezra. And you'll recall in Ezra, he's very, very emphatic about having the paperwork right to show that this is your inheritance and that you are descendants of Abraham and you are the people who by blood God has made a covenant with. Well, then after that, the Samaritans start to build up their own center of worship. There aren't Jews around, there's no temple around, and they build on the site of Mount Gerizim. Now, there's a moment in the Old Testament where the covenant is sort of renewed and announced to all the tribes of Israel and they assemble on two twin mountains, Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal by the community of Shechem. And in reality, Shechem early on after the conquest is sort of the religious centerpiece, the headquarters of all the things that are going on for the Hebrew people as they come out of exile and settle in Canaan. And apparently the Samaritans really latched onto that and continued to want to worship on Mount Gerizim. Indeed, to this day, that is still where the Samaritans worship. Well, as we discussed yesterday, this sandballot fellow mentioned in Nehemiah 2 and his family apparently were involved in building a temple, maybe the plans for this, even predated the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. But they've been working on a temple and apparently this temple gets completed and is the site of Samaritan worship during the Achaemenid Empire, during the era of Nehemiah and Ezra. So all of this stuff we're looking at is happening against the backdrop of this repugnant cultural other. The Jews are that to the Samaritans, the Samaritans are that to the Jews. All of this stuff that we're reading about is happening against that backdrop and this particular rivalry. Well, eventually after the Jewish rebellion against their later Greek overlords and the establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty, there's an incident where that temple ends up going away. But all kinds of things continue to happen religiously. There's turmoil constantly around Mount Gerizim. There's an issue that Pontius Pilate had to deal with with religious pilgrims in Mount Gerizim. This is a really big deal. And when Jesus meets with the Samaritan woman at the well in John chapter 4, it's okay if you don't remember this story. But if you do, you'll know what I'm talking about. He meets with her there and she says, sir, the woman said, I can see that you're a prophet. Our father's worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem. And then Jesus declared, and I'm just going to read it because we haven't had any red letters from Jesus for a while. Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritan's worship what you don't know. We worship what we do know. For salvation is from the Jews. Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. For they're the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth. Now lest I give the impression that this is just a 50-50 disagreement, look, if you think Jesus is the Son of God and reliable and knows all things, he just sided with the Jews on this argument. He is saying the provenance, the custody of the promises of God rightly came through Eli, rightly came through the Jewish people as they stood at his time, and he's saying the Samaritan claim is incorrect. Maybe you could read that differently, but it seems pretty overt. You Samaritan's worship what you do not know. Salvation is from the Jews. But I also don't want to give the impression that this is Jesus saying the Samaritans are bad and worthless. They are the repugnant cultural other. Get them. Exclude them from everything. Well, no, Jesus goes on to tell the parable of the good Samaritan, the repugnant cultural other who is the one who lives out the values of the kingdom. And then at another point Jesus said, who is my family? Who is the family of faith? Who is the family of God? Who is my brother, my sister, my mother? It's whoever does the will of my Father in heaven. So the teachings of Jesus really settle out this entire debate if you listen to him and take it seriously, but it doesn't negate the reality of the debate or the reality of the felt tension between Nehemiah and Sonbalat, because Sonbalat has a reason to hate Nehemiah. He's trying to advance a different narrative. His name is married to a different narrative. Nehemiah showing up and exuding competence and having resources and the blessing of the king is really bad for Sonbalat's narrative that the true blessings of God are heaped upon Mount Gerizim and the Samaritan worship there. And that to me is what makes Sonbalat a good bad guy, a believable bad guy and one who makes sense. He's advocating for a narrative he cannot divorce himself from, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to undermine the advancing of this other thing because if Nehemiah's narrative, if the Jews' narrative is right that God is directing all of this, then unfortunately, Sonbalat's narrative is wrong. This one looks like a zero-sum game, or at least that's how Sonbalat feels, and he's going to act in accordance with that. Hey, final thought. To everybody roots for the Lakers, the Raiders, the Chiefs, the Nebraska Corn Huskers. I don't want to give the impression that you're my repugnant culture or another. You're not. It was just an example. I think you're great. I like that you like the same sports I do, and I don't want to burn down your temples. Okay, that's it. I'm Matt.
