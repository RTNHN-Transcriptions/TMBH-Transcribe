And in that opening monologue, some of the jokes would hit and some of them wouldn't. And if they didn't, Letterman always said a great job of just playing it off and making the failure of the joke into a joke in and of itself, there's always one joke that would really work and you could tell, all right, that's where this audience is. Maybe you got a couple of buses of people from Northern Iowa who are in town and you can't really predict what they're going to like, but they liked that one. And you could see Letterman make a mental note of that and then you'd go and do the other stuff, the interviews and the guests and all of that. And if things started to lull, he would always find a way to steer it back around to that running joke and everybody would be like, oh, that's right, we're having fun here. That's what we're doing. That's, that's right. That's kind of what we're laughing about tonight. And it was really effective. And I remember making a mental note of that with my dad and he and I processing that whole strategy. I don't know if it was on purpose or not, but that's kind of the same formula we go with here, I guess. I mean, kind of go with a slavishly go with here. There's just so many things in the world and in life and in storytelling and in our imagination that can serve as this great memory hook, this great picture that you and I can talk about at the front end of an episode and then go and look at something in the Bible and be like, oh, it's just, it's like that. And then we can cover a whole bunch of ground and we get to the end and maybe we're all feeling like, wait, where are we talking about again? It seems like we talked about a ton of things and we just go back to the hook and it makes it neat and tidy and Letterman's way better at it than anybody ever. But that seems to be our social contract here. That's what we do. Whatever, every now and then we come to a certain passage where Jesus is using word pictures and I'm like, you know what? There's no doing it better than that. And that's the situation in Matthew chapter 23 as we get into the next of these woes to the religious leaders and the Pharisees and Jesus uses the imagery of a tomb to illustrate that they look good on the outside, but inside there's death. Here's how that one goes. Matthew 23, 27, what do you teachers of the law and Pharisees? You hypocrites. You're like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside, but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean in the same way. Likewise, on the outside, you appear to people as righteous, but on the inside, you're full of hypocrisy and wickedness. Well, just think about tombs for a minute. And some of them are really pretty. If you think about it, we went and looked for a grave in Chicago a couple of years ago. My buddy Destin and I, we did a podcast about this amazing world's fair that happened there and a couple of the architects, the main minds behind it were buried in this fancy cemetery from back in the day. And we went and found it in the dark. You looked in there and there's a lot of normal graves, but some of those graves are like straight up forts. They made a honeycomb hideouts, but out of a marble or granite or something. And the fort is like a monument to their great life. It's got carvings on it and then poetry that they liked. And yet despite how pretty all of that is, you still don't really want to go hang out in that fort because there's a corpse in there, maybe multiple corpses. It just doesn't matter how pretty you make your burial fort. There's still dead decaying human remains inside. And as much as I like people, then as much as I feel the sting of loss, just like anybody else and don't want to be too flippin about it. Look, we are men and women of action lies to not become us. As soon as the life goes out of a person, things change pretty quickly. And there's a reason that we put people in boxes and put people in the ground because it's gross. It's like the most unclean, scary otherworldly thing to be around death in that way, but get all cultures in one way or another. Try to put lipstick on that to help the living feel better about it or to make sure that we know that in the same way that we remember those who went before us. So we hope that people who come after us will remember us and all that's fine. The charge here from Jesus is just the same one as the woe that came right before this one. The charge is hypocrisy. You got a thing that looks good on the outside, but it conceals something that isn't good on the inside. In the last passage, it was you got this dish that looks good on the outside, but inside it's gross. In this passage, you got these tombs that are pretty up on the outside, but inside it's a death. Anytime you run into stuff like this in the Bible where you're like, oh, and those are kind of twin sayings, it should lead you to ask a pretty basic interpretive question, which is, is that just making the same point twice or is there a good reason that both of these examples are used in rapid succession? So my mind goes back to chapter 13, the third, yep, the third of the five great big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured. And there, remember, we had those little twin parables about yeast and a mustard seed and then another pair of twin parables about a treasure buried in a field and then a pearl that a merchant discovers in a market somewhere. It's like, well, are those saying the same things? There is a little wrinkle and as we dug deeper into that, we discovered, oh, there is a wrinkle and there's a perfectly good reason that both of those exist. So what I got cooking here, I just physically rolled up my sleeves like just out of some sort of habit or natural impulse. Let's get down to business. All right, we got the analogy of the cup, the outside's clean. The inside as we talked about yesterday is gross. It's like, why is that gross? Because if you grab a clean eating or drinking vessel and then it has the nastiest stuff ever in it, it's like a betrayal. And whether you've got a religious sense of clean and unclean or not, everybody's got a sense of taboo. Everybody's got a sense of grossed out. And when you encounter that scenario, good looking vessel on the outside, full of disgusting stuff on the inside and you get tricked, that's even different than going to the fridge and getting out the milk that looks good. But then you pour it out and it's got clumps in it and you're like, Oh, milk clumps, those are the worst, but you didn't eat them at least. You caught it because of the smell. It didn't like go into you. Whereas that one time that I got a glass of Coke at the road runner restaurant at Eastern and the 215 in Henderson, Nevada with a bunch of friends and somebody was doing something screwy back in the kitchen and they brought me out a clean glass full of Coke, but they had pumped hand soap or lotion in there a whole bunch of times. And I took that first swig and I could feel a little resistance coming up the straw before I registered the taste and I got a mouthful of soap or lotion or something. It was a nastiest thing ever. I don't think I was a jerk. There was no reason to do that stuff. But of course you're going to call the manager over. Then that's one of the rare times that let me talk to the manager is justified and be like, Hey, somebody like put cleaning products inside my drink on purpose probably. Can I just have one that doesn't have that in there, please? And the guy was nice about it. But again, the reason it's so bad is because in whatever way you were, I might think of clean and unclean, I was made unclean by that. I ingested something I never would have wanted to put in my body that I knew wouldn't be good for me and wouldn't be a good idea. And so I think the underlying principle of that last whoa that Jesus pronounces is going to hit a lot harder in a culture that has that sense of dietary clean and unclean because you say, and theoretically, this is something that you really care about and you really believe that ingesting the wrong thing makes you unclean. And you guys yourselves are the walking embodiment of a dirty trick that makes people unclean. Your deception has consequences and inflicts uncleanness on others by your own standards of how clean and unclean work. Then this next illustration that we're talking about today with the whitewash tombs hits on another point of clean and unclean. It is a carryover from the Old Testament civil ceremonial clean and unclean laws. And that is the uncleanness that comes with being around death. Now think about it, you are grossed out, get the heebie, Geebies and feel your taboo ickness very differently. If you go and grab a clean glass and pour some water in there and then discover that there's some nasty disgusting residue that you just ingested, that's a very different grossed out, then you feel if you got to move some stuff around in the yard and something smells a little funky and you flip it over and you discover that something has died right there in the backyard underneath the box or something and it's being consumed and it reeks and you feel that gag reflex ingesting gross stuff is different unclean than accidentally touching and countering and being around death. It's just typically something that we like to distance ourselves from. As we talked about yesterday with that Greek word harpage, the previous passage about the unclean vessels is particularly pointing a finger at this lust for other people's stuff, this willingness to extort to thieve to rob even plunder from other people with no concern for what is right. That's what's being called out there in this whitewashed tombs example. Jesus says overtly looks good on the outside, but on the inside is a hypocrisy and a wickedness I will paraphrase a little bit and also say an evil, a corruption that leads to death that is spiritual soul, even physical death. It's right there under the surface and people should be as appalled by what is under the surface with the Pharisees as they are if they go out in the yard and flip something over and find some dead neighbor cat under their rotting out. Apologies to all the cat lovers, but there's another distinction between these two parallel declarations of woe and that distinction is that in the first one, there's instruction about what you could theoretically do to make it better. Remember that says, what do you teach is along the Pharisees, you hypocrites, you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they're full of greed and self indulgence. Oh no, that's really bad. That's terrible. But here's something to do blind Pharisee first clean the inside of the cup and dish and then the outside will also be clean. But there is no such prescription for how to solve this greater state of decay and hypocrisy and deception that he seems to be citing next in the passage that we're talking about with these whitewashed tombs. It's almost like these are chronological that the first corruption happens in a way that you could tidy up. But now when you get to the whitewashed tomb places like you've completely given yourself over to it. And again, there's no instruction for what to do. I mean, it's death. What are you going to do about it? Perform CPR on the dead neighbor cat that crawled under your box in your backyard and died. The thing's dead. It's not getting less dead. It's completely over. And so in the same way, verse 28, on the outside, you appear to people as righteous, but on the inside, you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness, end of woe. And then we're going to be on to the next woe. As we discussed yesterday, all of these woes are escalating and they're all playing off of the previous woe in the same way that the drinking vessels woe doubles down on the imagery of clean and unclean that was introduced in the woe about the donations and straining out the gnat, but swallow a camel business. So the next woe is going to pile onto this imagery of tombs and death and decay as we get down the home stretch to the final and complete denunciation of everything about the Phariseic mess that Jesus is pointing out. So quick before we go, I've just got one special thank you that I want to say before we close things out. And that is a huge thank you to Jesus of Nazareth for coming up with the likewise illustration today. I think it was really smart and really effective. He deserves a lot of credit for that. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible on our podcast. Let's do this again soon.
