I'm grouchy. I'm really super grouchy as I sit down and record this because we have this thing unfolding in my country right now about a Hellfire missile that we shot at a family, an aid worker, and somebody who was trying to do things that were redemptive and good in his own country. Didn't have the option to leave the country or go anywhere else. They all he could do because of political circumstances was just try to make the very best of where he was and try to do things to fix things and make it better. And my government took tax dollars from people who voted against all of these actions and use those tax dollars to pay for a system by which something like this could happen. And then we used a drone, something against which there's absolutely no defense and we Hellfire missile a compound because I apparently we thought it was terrorists or something. Whether you want to criticize people for being evil or people for being inept either way, if you hear a story like that and your response to what unfolded as I'm recording this here in the last week or so in my country in Afghanistan and your first impulse is to be like, well, hold on, that's the cost of doing business and something like bad things. You can't always. I mean, we wish we could have absolute if it doesn't bring moral outrage. I don't know what the heck is the matter with you. That should be the kind of story that universally stirs outrage in everyone. Don't need to score political points against that guy or that lady or this team or that team. Don't care. I'm saying and where my outrage lies on this issue is I'm super against using drones and Hellfire missiles to rain deaths on families and moral outrage probably isn't even an appropriate term to describe the level of anger that I feel and that my guess would be almost every single one of you feels as well. I picked this one because it's recent and because it's an obvious moral affront. It's a terrible, terrible thing that that thing happened. Jesus tells a story in Matthew 21 that is meant to conjure the same level of inarguable outrage. It smacks a little bit of a conversation we had a while back between Nathan the Prophet and David where David's like, what? Somebody did this morally outrageous thing and the Prophet's like, you are that man. It was, is you and did broke David's heart and it changed him. Now here we see that you are that man is the conclusion of the parable we're about to look at as well, but it doesn't seem to have had any softening effect on its intended audience in the same way that the words of the Prophet had on David back in the day. Here's where we're at where Matthew chapter 21. Jesus enters the temple and he's teaching there. He's not afraid of anybody. He just goes right back to his father's house doing what he's supposed to do. The religious leaders come to him. They try to catch him in a trap asking him where he gets off doing all this stuff. And Jesus is like, Oh, okay, I'll answer you, but you got to answer me a question too. Where did John the Baptist get the authority to do this? Where did his baptism come from from heaven or from men? They go into a little group. They huddle up there like we can't that we just can't answer that. That's a devastating loss for us either way. So they come back out and they're like, yeah, we don't know. Yes, you do. That's implicit in the text. It doesn't actually say that. And Jesus is like, okay, well, neither will I tell you by what authority I'm doing these things. And there Jesus weathers their shot. And now he goes back on offense. And yesterday we looked at a parable where a landowner goes to his kid and he's like, I go out into the vineyard and work as you're supposed to do. And the kids like, yeah, I'm not going to do that. But then he does it anyway. And he says to the second kid, I go out into the vineyard and work. He's like, yeah, I'll definitely do that. But then he doesn't do it at all. And then Jesus is like, Oh yeah, well, which one of these two did the will of the father and the religious leaders who were still standing there awkwardly are like, we know it's the first. And he's like, yeah, it's the first. And I'll tell you the truth that the people who are really screwed up and undesirable who maybe got it wrong at first, but then listened to John's message and saw me for who I am, they're ahead of you on the way to the kingdom. And you saw this change in their lives and didn't bring about any repentance or softening in you at all. At this point, it's ramping up. But now we get to the moral outrage. Listen to another parable. There's a landowner who planted a vineyard and we put a wall around it and dug a wine press in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. And in the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. Oh, this is normal enough. The tenants seized his servants and they beat one. They killed another and they stoned a third. Then he sent other servants to them more than the first time and the tenants treated them all the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. They respect my son, he said, but when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, this is the air. Come on, let's kill him, take the inheritance. So they took him, threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants? And then we get the reply from the religious leaders, which my interpretation of the story can only be delivered with a big grudging voice. Yeah, he'll bring those wretches out to a wretched end, they replied, and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time, Jesus said to them, have you never read the scriptures? The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone. The Lord has done this and it's marvelous in our eyes. Therefore, I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to people who will produce its fruit. He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed. And chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus parable. They knew he was talking about them. They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet. So very, very much here to work through. Did the story outrage you? I mean, it's supposed to. It's supposed to make you burn with righteous, just anger that these clowns, these underlings, these people who imagine that they're the ones who are in authority or that they're the owners or that, well, the master doesn't actually provide any value. I mean, what did he really do? Just own land? That doesn't do anything. Labor is the thing that actually produces value. So they get outraged and angry and they're like, kill the landlords and so send the servants and then there's kill the servants. And then the king who we've established from other parts of the book of Matthew, like the deal here culturally is like how you treat the king's representative is how you're treating the king. And what's crazy is that the king isn't like, I'm sorry, what now? Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got to take this. You said what happened to my servants that I sent to that one of many vineyards that I own? They did what? Yeah. Uh, ready the army. We're going to go and deal with this right now. No, no, get the sharp swords. I want the full armor. We are going to go put these fools down. They will pay for what they that's what a king in the ancient Near East would do in response to this. So the twist in this parable is that instead of raging at these murderous vile, ungrateful, mentally tainted, morally deficient monsters who work for him, he instead sends more servants. Maybe you could read that and be like, dang, like I'm glad you're being nice to the monstrous people. But if I'm one of the servants, I'm like, maybe you could be nicer to me. But the expectation is if you're truly in service of this king, you know that these are the ground rules. These are the values of this kingdom. He might just put you as his servant in a position where you go and represent his benevolence and patience and long suffering in places where it might hurt you physically to be a servant of this king. So he sends more servants and they treat them all the same way. Now typically in the ancient Near East, what would need to happen now is another phone call comes in. He's doing some of these. I'm sorry. I got to take this as urgent. Yeah, what's going on? Seriously again, all of them. That is the, that is the last straw. Get my sword. Get the men. We're going to go put this, but he doesn't do that again. That's what you'd expect. But again, the twist is that he continues to be patient and long suffering. And finally, he's like, well, surely they'll listen to my son. He wants reconciliation. Why would you want reconciliation with such obvious injustice, such evil, such vile base behavior? You can't trust these people. They're irredeemable. They're done. They're beyond the pale. But instead he sends his own son. He puts his own son on a horse and sends his own flesh and blood to go and resolve this. Did he really think that they would listen to his son? Was this king being a fool? Is this a reflection of the lack of wisdom of the king? Or is this a reflection of the patience and the bizarre, unmerited, unearned favor and love and compassion that this king has for these awful workers who not only get things wrong, but it's not like a bumbling get things wrong. It's a cruel animal like evil willful get things wrong. He sends his son. What do you know? They behave exactly the way they've behaved all along. And now and only now do we get to a place where the landlord is like, all right, enough. And even there. Jesus doesn't say exactly what's going to happen. He instead says, what do you guys think is going to happen? And it's the religious leaders who say, yeah, at this point, it's justice time. And that's going to be it. Blood is going to be shed. Judgment is inbound. And then interestingly, Jesus only partially affirms their estimation, agreeing with the religious leaders assumption that the tenants who were tending the land will be stripped of tending the land and someone else is going to be put in charge. A big part of the effectiveness of this parable is in the moral outrage. It is designed to rightly and justly spark in anyone who hears the story. But unlike the news headlines that I'm angry about and that I talked about at the beginning of this episode, this story of Jesus doesn't end with just a moral senseless outrage with nowhere to direct your frustration in a way that's going to be effective. But instead it points us toward a deeper question. The news headlines don't tend to do. And that is what is the nature of this landowner. Why does he behave the way he does? And what is he going to do next? Like I said, there's a lot more to work through here coming up. Thank you for indulging me the occasional doses of passion. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
