This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and today's a big day because we're starting a new season of the program. So if you're brand new, you picked a great day to jump in. You're going to get fresh with the rest of us. Here's what we do around here. We pick a book of the Bible and then we work straight through it. One little chunk at a time. We track down rabbit trails and we learn it together. I do not know all the things about the Bible or Christianity or the history of the church. There's a lot to learn. It's a very big subject. So part of the fun of this format is that we have time and we dedicate a little bit of time every day to just thinking about it together and learning about it together in real time. So far we did a big long series on the book of Matthew starring Jesus. That one was, I thought, just a blast. It was super fun. Then we did a quick little season where we covered one book of the Bible per day real real fast. Then in season three, we did the Old Testament, highly dramatic, very fun book of Esther set during the very end of the Old Testament period in the Persian age of the Bible. Then after that, we did the book of Nehemiah in the last season that we just finished up. That's also an Old Testament book. So now we're about to fast forward 400 years and change. I'm a better part of 500 years really, all the way to the book of Galatians, which is a New Testament book, but really letter is probably the better descriptor for what it is. It isn't a book like it has a beginning, a middle, an end and a really intense plot with characters and story development. It is a letter written by a concerned gentleman, this is the apostle Paul, to a bunch of people who are pretty new at following Jesus. For them, it was going great early on. Then some stuff happened, some people showed up with different opinions and the whole proposition turned real weird. Paul gets wind of it and he writes this letter to help sort out the weirdness that is set in and the collateral awesomeness of Galatians for you and I, looking at it together, is that it deals with questions that you got to ask when you're tackling the big stuff. God, life, death, eternity. Your own behavior, your own worth or worthiness. And also it sort of speaks directly to some of the weirder, cultier, more controlling impulses that a lot of times come with religion. So there's really important big picture, but also very personally applicable theology stuff going on here. And I think you and I are going to have a blast going through this thing. Another reason I think it's going to be particularly fun going through it is the tone of the author. Paul has got the snark dial set to 11 for a good chunk of this letter. So it's not this clinical, pristine, boring, human resources speak sort of correction. It is very human. It is hot blooded. It is clearly very personal to the author of this letter and that adds a lot of spice to it and I think keeps it really fun. I suppose what you just got there is my four minute sales pitch for what the podcast is in general and why this book is great and how we're going to come at it and why it's going to be fun and interesting and useful for you, I hope. So yeah, no beating around the bush straight up. I'm asking. I hope that it sounds interesting to you and that you would do me the honor of hanging out with me as we work through the book of Galatians together. Something to think about. Okay, let's talk more about the book. Have you ever been in a situation where you start off on a relationship or a part of a new group or institution or something? You start something new and it is awesome. It's energizing and it's fresh. You feel like your eyes have been opened to this new thing and you feel this lightness in your step and this optimism about everything and you're like, dang, I think I just solved life. Stuff is awesome now. This person, this thing I'm a part of, whatever it is, it's just great. But then somewhere along the way, you get the spidey sense. It starts to go off. You get a little warning bells. Maybe somebody says something weird. Maybe if it's an institution that you're imagining here, there's some new policy that gets initiated. You try to block out that voice in your head that is saying, this is weird. I don't know if this is a good idea. That was weird. Was that a little much? What did they mean by that remark right there? Because you want it to continue to be awesome and you don't want it to turn out to be weird. But then more and more things happen and you realize, that gross. This is turning controlling and it's not what I thought it was. I was having fun, but now I'm not having fun. The value proposition is flipped upside down. What do I do? And then you kind of have three options in that situation. One, you can just go with it and be like, well, sunk cost fallacy. I'm already this far into this thing and it makes me happy and I kind of burned some bridges to get into it. So I am just going to live in this new weird controlling, unhealthy, culty environment. And I guess that's just my fate and that's what I'm going to do now. Or option number two would be I am out and I don't care if it's hard, but I do not do things like this. And as soon as I figure out that something is weird and controlling and bizarre, I'm just, I'm leaving. This is no longer healthy. Or option number three is to say, now the weird controlling, unhealthy stuff isn't supposed to be here. That's not what makes this awesome. I'm going to examine what's going on here and I'm going to keep all of the great stuff and I'm going to get rid of all of the stuff that's weird and screwed up and that shouldn't be here and isn't in keeping with the principle of the thing. Anyway, so suppose option number four is just pretend none of it's happening and ignore all of that and try to kill that little spidey sense in the back of your head. I think we've all been in a place where we have encountered something like that, a situation like that, we've had to make a choice as to how we're going to respond. Well, it's a situation kind of like that that is the occasion for the writing of the letter that we're looking at, the book of Galatians here in the New Testament. You got a bunch of people who jumped into a thing that is following Jesus and it was great. It was going super and they were super excited about all of it. They eagerly received the message of Jesus more on exactly what that message is in coming conversations and it's working these little communities of life giving faith for all kinds of people from across all of the socioeconomic spectrum. People who normally would not even have much in common, all of a sudden, all of these totally diverse people are coming together and worshiping Jesus together and it's going great. But then along came some outsiders who took it upon themselves to go in and say, wait, no, there are some rules. You didn't hear about them at first and maybe they're not even actual rules, but they should be actual rules and we are going to inflict those bonus controlling quirky, weird rules upon you. Then it throws everybody into confusion. It's weird and it takes the luster off of it all and it used to feel awesome and now it feels gross. And now these little communities of faith that had been thriving are suddenly really struggling and when the guy who went around and initiated these little communities of faith, the apostle Paul, gets wind that this is going on, he's real, real mad and he chooses the option that I threw out a second ago to say, no, we're going to examine all of this and we're going to throw out the stupid stuff and we're going to keep the good stuff because this following Jesus thing is right and it's true and it's good and it's life giving and this other stuff that is weird and controlling and culty, no, we're not going to do that and we're not going to take any hostages here. I mentioned earlier that the letter has a bit of a tone to it. That's why Paul is legitimately angry that people are coming in with this weird controlling culty, rule oriented bait and switch change the deal nonsense and he is not going to hold much back as he calls that out. So what we are getting in the book of Galatians is a letter to a bunch of people who signed up for something awesome that was going awesome and then some weird controlling types inserted themselves into the situation and started inflicting their weird little proclivities on these happy, thriving people and a long comes Papa Bear in the form of Paul the apostle to call out the nonsense and get rid of the riffraff and try to get things back on track. But this is not just a peek into some ancient tension that teaches us a little bit about human nature. This has implications that resound through history, that resound through the human spirit and the human soul regardless of when someone is picking up and reading this letter. So the implications are very similar for the person who this letter was originally written to as they are to a person who read it 300 years later as they are to you and me picking it up and looking at it right now together. This book of the Bible has been a big deal for a long time and it has bearing on the lives of the people who encounter it right now even today as you are listening to this. I think we're going to have a blast learning about it together. I can't wait to see what we find, what we discover, how it affects us. Thank you so much for being here for the first episode of this season for even considering committing to this thing. And I hope you're here with me on the last episode of this season when we can give each other an over the microphone high five celebrating that we had fun. We put in the work and the thought to get the book of Galatians in our hip pocket. All right, more tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
