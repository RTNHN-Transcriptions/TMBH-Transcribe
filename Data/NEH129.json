It's fast, fun, free, daily, deep-dye Bible. And right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy to use format at thetmbh.com. All right, I got a genuine question for you here, even though I guess I don't get to hear your answer because this is the one-way nature of the medium. But we have a discussion thing. Let's link down below. You can go and tell me the answer to the following question down there if you wanted to. What is your favorite part of a wedding? I got a lot. I really genuinely enjoy weddings. I know that it's very common for dudes to kind of joke about weddings being dumb and like kind of a girl thing. But I think that's a dumb perspective. I think weddings are great. I think they are meaningful. I think it's a human event. I think it's a powerful event. You go to a wedding, you're watching history being made and you are participating. If you're there, you're a part. I think they're just awesome. Now I got a few parts that I don't like as much. I don't generally like the DJ introductions at the reception with a wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah. The fake cheering. I don't know. I've seen a few of them that have gone well, but generally that's not my ultra favorite. There's a few things that are maybe a little bit cheesy, but also anything that's cheesy and overdone is kind of a rite of passage, right? You can give people a pass for that stuff. I mean, if you go to Mount Rushmore as much as I do, every time you walk up, you see a group of people sticking their fingers up George Washington's nose. Like, yeah, there that is. Again, there's like a hundred people in front of me and all of them other pointer finger up and they're giggling. Like I get it. Probably people who live in Pisa are like, yeah, there you're holding up that tower again. Look at that. It's leaning. It's just crazy. You can make fun of that stuff, but also it's kind of just what you do when you've been there. You know, Washington's nose, you hold up the thing. They're dumb little wedding traditions and whatnot. They probably aren't that big a deal, but whatever. I mean, it proves you were there and I kind of just like all of it, except maybe those DJ introductions and maybe you're coming up with a whole bunch of different things for what you like best about weddings. But my favorite part is the vows. Everything else is done. No goofing around. There's no music. This isn't the time for the best man to do the funny little prank or whatever they're going to do. Nothing set. Everything is picturesque. Nothing else is happening. Hopefully the bride in the groom have been coached up to look deeply into each other's eyes. Think about nothing else knowing that all the details are cared for. We're all here for this. We all want you to be locked into this moment to think about each word, each syllable, what you are expressing, what you're saying, what you're agreeing to. Say it harder and more earnestly than anything you've ever said to the person you love the most. I adore watching that moment. I just adore it. Like I said before, when you are witness to somebody's wedding vows, you are witness to history. I think it's a beautiful moment. It's okay if you like other stuff too. I would love to hear, once again, whatever it is that you think is the best stuff about weddings. But the vow part is the part that we're getting into right now in Nehemiah chapter 10. As we've discussed, as we liken this ratification of the covenant ceremony that's happening in Nehemiah 10 to a modern wedding, we got the part where all the people, all the dignitaries and participants are seated. That's verses one through 27. I sang that to you a few days ago. It's a long list of people. The governor comes in and is honored because of his role and who he is and what he's done. The priests come in, then the Levites come in. The leaders of the people come in. Maybe they walked in an actual processional. Maybe it's just the way it's presented in order and list form in the text. Either way, the metaphor holds. So we had everybody in and seated. The people who were up front, the people who were in the first few rows and all the people who were attending. Then we got the part that we looked at yesterday where metaphorically, the priest or the pastor gets up and says, hey, we're here to do a wedding and we're going to join this man and this woman together in holy matrimony. And you might all be like, yep, I know why we're here. I can totally tell. But it's a great reminder and it's part of what sets this ceremony aside as something very sacred and unique to all of our life experience. Can we get down with the part where that announcement happens? Maybe there's like a unity sandwich or there's some kind of song or something, special music. I'm sure poetry reading, it's all great. We had that and bagpipes at my wedding. So I'm not going to knock people for doing goofy stuff of weddings. I get it. It's just going to be part of the thing. But then we get to what for me is the main event and those are the vows and to the substance of the vows distraction free. These are the terms of the covenant. This is what we're doing and this is what that sounds like for the people who were making such a covenant, sealing such a covenant in Nehemiah 10 starting in verse 30. We promise not to give our daughters in marriage to the peoples around us or take their daughters for our sons. Isn't that interesting that the first thing on the list of this covenant that I've been comparing to a modern marriage covenant is something about marriage. Yeah, I think it probably lines up for a whole lot of good reasons. But as much as anything, the reason this one is right at the beginning of this renewal of the covenant, this ratification of the covenant is because this is what they've been getting wrong and they all just assented in Nehemiah chapter 9 that this is what they've been getting wrong. We went and we chased after other values, other cultures that are not rooted in you, the one true God and we either tried to mingle their gods who are fake with you God who have demonstrated yourself to be real or we just abandoned you all together and joined their weird sex cult and we're sorry. It didn't go well. Now we find ourselves in slavery. We know this is our fault and that you have merely kept the terms of the covenant that exists, the curses and the oaths. You're just doing what you said you would do. You've been faithful and steady in that. We have been faithless. So because they get that, they put this one right at the front. Nehemiah and Ezra both have huge chunks of their books that are dedicated to sorting out this particular problem and it sounds real easy, right? Like, well, okay, you're in unique people groups that apart miraculously by God confirmed by miracles. You think about the pressure that they were under in the ancient world because I mean, the world wasn't getting bigger at this point in history. People weren't getting further apart. This isn't Babel. We're at a point in history here in the fifth century where the world is getting smaller all the time and it's going to get smaller for the next 900 years as mega empires collide. The Greeks, the Macedonians, the Persians, the descendants of the Greek empires after that, the Romans, the Carthaginians, eventually the different European kingdoms for a thousand years more or less. The world is going to get smaller. It's going to be dominated by warfare and empire building, the kind of things that you make video games about and in the middle of all of that is going to be this little tiny people group concentrated in one part of the world, but also scattered to all the other urban centers of the world and they are going to try to stay set apart. They're going to do their own thing. They're not going to worship Saturn or Jupiter, Zeus or Thor. They're not going to worship Ahura Mazda even though it would benefit them. They're not going to worship Ra even though they're going to have a strong robust presence in Alexandria in northern Egypt. They're going to reject all of that. They're going to dress weird. They're going to look weird. They're going to marry weird. They're going to family weird and all of that starts with marrying within their own people group. That's the first part of the vow that they make here. As I mentioned yesterday, that is very foreign and very strange to the modern mind, but entirely sensible if we take into account what this story has been. This very unique story for this very unique people with very unique circumstances. That's a big one. You just eliminated basically 99.9% of the global population for people you could marry and we're only one sentence into these covenant vows. Let's see what else we got. When the neighboring peoples bring merchandise or grain to sell on the Sabbath, this is verse 31, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on any holy day. Every seventh year, we will forego working the land and we will cancel all debts. Okay. So one, we're going to do marriage differently. Two, we're going to do business differently. There is something that is more important than work. Yeah. And with the time in mind, we're going to just unpack this thing that is more important even than business and making money in more detail tomorrow. We're going to take our time and try to make sense of each of these little elements of these vows that are being taken because they're important. They shape the world that Jesus is about to walk into. They sort of spike the football at the end of the story. We've been really working on real hard that is understanding the Old Testament. And even if you're not Jewish, these vows that they took here in the fall of 444 BC that are written down right here, these shape your world. These vows are actively affecting your life and have for your whole life, whether you ever took these vows yourself or not. Once again, over the last couple of days, I've heard from more of you who got the packets in the mail, the Galatians notebook for next season, the Nehemiah sticker. And thank you for the nice feedback on that. I'm sending those out because I want to say thank you. So hopefully that is coming through. This podcast wouldn't exist without those of you who are kind enough to support it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for doing it. It also wouldn't exist without everybody else who doesn't feel like supporting a thing on the internet. You don't have to support this thing on the internet. But if you weren't here, well, we also couldn't do it. So thanks for being up and for this conversation, for being interested in it. Once again, if for whatever reason you didn't get everything that was supposed to be in that packet, please let me know the tmbh at gmail.com. And we will always make sure that you've got all the stuff that you were supposed to get because we want you to have it. All right. More about this very impactful ancient covenant ceremony that still affects our lives and kind of feels like a wedding in some ways. I'm on, Yana. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
