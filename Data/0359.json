It was 1969 was woodstock and through the 70s and 80s you saw a bunch of these knockoffs where people tried to recapture the magic. There were more woodstock events. I remember in the 90s there was a return to woodstock with all of the alternative rock people and it just, I don't know, it never had the same vibe. But there was a Christian version of this called Cornerstone in Illinois that I used to go to. And we're not talking about some urban fairgrounds with multiple stages and electricity and indoor plumbing kind of event. We're talking about a woodstock style event. I think woodstock was just a farm, right? And so this Cornerstone thing was like that and there are probably several of you listening right now who actually were there with me and we bummed around or said hi or hi five or Ron, a youth group trip together or whatever. But one of the amazing things about that kind of music festival is simply the energy of having that many people bumming around in the woods at the same time. Setting up makeshift tent cities and getting by and resources are far away and limited. So you just connect with whoever you can connect with and swap things and even the sanitized Christian hippie version at something like Cornerstone, which was not entirely sanitized. You still get that buzz. You get that feel of the weirdness of this event. It feels like something meaningful is happening simply by merit of how irregular the behavior is to grab a bunch of people and just go out the woods together and listen to things and see what happens. And likewise, I think there was something socially more shocking about what we see happening in Matthew chapter 15. And really all of Matthew with these spontaneous crowds showing up for Jesus, but particularly right here, we're out in the desert. We've established that we're on the east side of the Sea of Galilee, which is, I don't know, it's like getting into the neighborhood of Amman Jordan. This is pretty dry territory. And we're either in the heart of the region that would later be described by Pliny the Elder as the Decapolis or we're just on the north end of what the Decapolis was at the time of Jesus in other Gentile cities, wherever we place this event as having happened. It's pretty evident that it's in Gentile territory. And we just know from the landscape that it was more rugged territory than the places where a lot of this other stuff had been going on. And so all these people show up and they're hanging around with Jesus and it goes down like this, Matthew 15, 29. Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. He left Tyre and side on up north. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. Great crowds came to him, bringing their lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others and laid them at his feet and healed them. The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. Okay, we've kind of covered that stuff already. And now we get into the fresh stuff. Jesus called his disciples to him and said, Hey, I have compassion for these people. They've already been with me for three days and I had nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry or they might collapse on the way. His disciples answered, well, where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd? Well, how many loaves do you have? Jesus asked seven, they replied and a few small fish. He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. And I'm not even going to keep reading from there. We're into verse 35. We'll pick it up in verse 36 in a second, because I just can't help but get into the commentary part here is we look at the oddness of the disciples response. And we're going to have to break this down to figure out why they respond the way they did given the immediate context of what's going on here. But first, big picture, this is nuts. There are 4,000 men we are about to find out who are just hanging out in the desert with Jesus. There were no flyers. There was no planning. There's no outhouses. Nobody apparently thought to bring along multiple days worth of food. I mean, just think about what it would take for you to go to Woodstock or Cornerstone on no notice whatsoever with limited supplies and then refuse to leave. Now don't picture yourself being a child. He's like 16 years old. He's like, I'm mad at you, dad. I'm going to a rock concert on a farm and I don't know what's going to happen to me. I might come back someday. Don't you dare walk out that door. I love rap music. I always happen. I always will slam. I don't mean that kind of a scenario. Nothing personal, temperamental, 15 and 16 year olds. I mean, what if you were an adult with a job and kids, like family and stuff and you had things you needed to do, you needed to smash the rocks together or dry out your leather strips or whatever they did back then. And if you didn't dry out your strips of leather, smash your rocks, the other rock smashers or leather strippers, we're going to get ahead of you, put you out of business. But you don't care because there's giant spontaneous rock festival out on the hillside where everything's sandy and dusty and there's no food or water or plumbing of any kind. And you just have to be there. I mean, really, what would it take to get you to blow off all the things you have going on and head out there, even with your family? We might imagine, as I just jokingly did in describing their hypothetical jobs, that these were simple people who didn't have anything to do. But these were not simple people. These were people like you. They existed in an economy. They existed in a social setting, where they tried to impress other people either consciously or subconsciously. They had concerns, they thought about mortality, they thought about politics, they thought about art. And then they all went on this spontaneous three day plus hiking camping trip to the middle of nowhere with no plan whatsoever. So before we even get into the miracle and the confusing response of the disciples, this is just one of those moments where I want to pause and think about and appreciate socially what is being reported to us here. These things of biblical proportions, my friends, they just roll by us. They roll by me. And unless I pump the brakes and really intentionally think about me in that setting, what would I do and what would it take to get me to do that? Then it does just slide by. I'm like, well, the Bible, everything's bigger. People coming back from the dead and armies just being defeated, magic and yeah, several thousand people just showing up for an event with no pre planning or tickets or parking or anything like that. That's how the Bible is. Things are different now. Yeah, but are they? Or was something really unusual going on here with people who otherwise would be very similar to us? I think it's a ladder. A few years back when I was living in Western Wyoming, the white stripes or maybe it was just Jack White. No, I think it was the white stripes showed up in Jackson, Wyoming, which is not a big town and it's a posh town, but it's not big and there's not really much around it. And people in this wild region of Western Wyoming got news throughout the afternoon that the white stripes are weirdly in Jackson, and they're setting up to play a spontaneous show. And people just jumped in their cars and drove to go and pack the place out and take in this show. And of course, nobody did that when some local band that has 200 followers on Facebook was going to play a surprise show in Jackson. They did it because the reputation of Jack White preceded him. And when he was in town, it's like, this is our chance. We got to go. It doesn't matter if we're being irresponsible. Looks like the same thing is happening here. Surely these people had heard about what was going on with Jesus. That's why the crowd assembled. He didn't invite anyone. He's trying to get away from people right now. And I like, whoa, he's in town. Well, sort of in town close enough for me, and they scrambled this way. This is an enormous social phenomenon that's occurring, but other similar social phenomena had been occurring at this time. You'd had other messianic leaders who had come and gone. Two of them get referenced over here at the beginning of the back. I don't need to turn to it. You remember the thing? Gamaliel, one of the leaders of the Sanhedrin is like, we got this, what was the news name? Theodus guy, we've got this Judas, the Galilean. Dang it. Now I have to look in case I did just completely butcher that. Holy cow. I opened directly to that page. It's a miracle. And the guy's names were indeed Theodus and somebody else. Yeah, Judas, the Galilean. These two guys led some kind of violent revolt. And did gigantic pageantry and it ended in really ugly, weird, violent, almost embarrassing ways. Their teaching never made a ton of sense. There was a bit more of brigandhood to Judas, the Galileans style. And so we've had these other people who were hinting at being messianic claimants. There are a bunch more that I could list off. I think I'm going to do a YouTube video about those soon so you can check that out if you want. But this has no military fervor. This has no element of zealotry of let's get rid of the Romans. It's just redemptive. Let's go out to the countryside. We have no idea what's on the schedule or what he's going to do. We're just going to hang around and see if we can get the dude's attention and see if he is what we've been told he is. And if so, maybe their first priority was let's see if he can address our needs. And maybe their second priority was if he can, let's see if we can find out what he wants. Why is he here? What is he doing? How do we fit into the thing is just the most of the Jewish stuff is all pretty Jewish. So is this more pretty Jewish stuff or do we get to play? Well, you get to the end of day one of Decapolis stock and Jesus is still healing people and people are still hanging around. Probably the crowd is still going and people figure out like, hey, there's no reason to leave. It's not like, oh man, well, maybe I'll have more time to watch people get miraculously healed and stuff in a couple weeks. I'm just super busy right now. This is your one chance. And they all seem to spontaneously get it and they all gather around. And before we even move on to the bigger questions tomorrow, I just wanted to take today and stop and be like, hey, let's try to really wrap our brains around the scope and the significance of Jesus reputation and his character and the credibility of the miraculous claims and rumors surrounding him just using as a metric the behavior of normal people like you and me. But for the people who made the trip, good for them, people who thought there was something special to Jesus and operated on that hunch and went out there, I guess they're vindicated. They imagine their old person stories years later like, yeah, kid, I was at the capitalist stock. Wow. Well, did anything happen? Was it real? Crazy thing is it's true. Jesus, kingdom, miracles, all of it. It's all true. Just what a cool story to be able to tell people that you were actually at the capitalist stock when this completely spontaneous mega event unfolded in a completely surprising remote part of the world where theoretically Jesus wouldn't even have any business being tomorrow. We're going to talk about why Jesus decided that he did have business being there and why it matters. All right, that's a wrap. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.1, "text": " Music", "tokens": [7849], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5735496976482335, "compression_ratio": 1.5628415300546448, "no_speech_prob": 0.01179459784179926}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 11.1, "end": 15.780000000000001, "text": " The only thing I can do to one of those music festivals that was fashioned after Woodstock", "tokens": [383, 691, 1517, 314, 460, 466, 284, 530, 286, 883, 2647, 25575, 326, 373, 35458, 706, 5326, 13578], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5735496976482335, "compression_ratio": 1.5628415300546448, "no_speech_prob": 0.01179459784179926}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 15.780000000000001, "end": 20.88, "text": " Woodstock, I mean I guess not everybody would necessarily know this is getting to be a pretty old phenomenon", "tokens": [5326, 13578, 11, 314, 1612, 314, 4724, 407, 7288, 561, 6646, 760, 428, 318, 1972, 284, 307, 257, 2495, 1468, 10733], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5735496976482335, "compression_ratio": 1.5628415300546448, "no_speech_prob": 0.01179459784179926}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 20.88, "end": 26.2, "text": " it predates my life, but Woodstock was this outdoor music festival in my country", "tokens": [340, 2747, 689, 616, 1204, 11, 475, 5326, 13578, 373, 428, 15162, 2647, 10876, 287, 616, 1499], "temperature": 0.6, "avg_logprob": -0.5735496976482335, "compression_ratio": 1.5628415300546448, "no_speech_prob": 0.01179459784179926}, {"id": 4, "seek": 2620, "start": 26.2, "end": 30.919999999999998, "text": " It's kind of associated with the hippies.
