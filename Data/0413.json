This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and I remember one time I was taking a political science course in college. I had a great professor, super respected, and she gave us this short notice test one time. She gave us a blank map of the world one week and was like, hey, you got to know all the countries on here for next weeks. We went and we studied and worked on it as a class and we came back and I felt pretty ready to go. She's handing the thing out and that guy in our class, because every class has a that guy, no, it wasn't me. It might have been me. So she's handing out the test and as she hands it to that guy, he says loud enough for everyone to hear. Professor, hypothetically, would be the reward if one of the students happened to have also learned all of the capitals of all of the countries. I don't remember exactly how she phrased her response, but it was something like this. Ugh, it's just this you just made me throw up in my mouth a little bit. Gross. She didn't even dignify it with words, as I recall. I don't know. The haze of time might have fogged that over. Maybe that's just what I wish her response would have been. But at the time we ridiculed him a little bit. That obviously didn't play well amongst a bunch of 19 and 20 year old college students. But over time, I become a little more empathetic to that. I mean, come on, what he was trying to do in his misguided kid way was to say, I respect you as a professor. I get what you're going for. I see why this stuff is important. And if this is the bar that is normal, then I would love to exceed it, ma'am, just to show you how committed I am to the thing that you are trying to teach us. Yeah. Okay. Whether you're empathetic to that or not, if you can get it, then it's probably really easy to understand what I think Peter is doing here in Matthew chapter 18. Come on. Peter's impressed with Jesus. Look what's happened through these 18 chapters. Jesus does amazing stuff. He called Peter out of being a fisherman, just working on the Sea of Galilee and took him out of that rather mundane, predictable life into this life of massive adventure and high stakes and risk and reward and wisdom and teaching and answers to the deepest questions of life. Peter's been around violence and adventure and political intrigue and beauty and intimacy and just all of these amazing things. And all of this has come as a result of hanging around with Jesus. Of course, he's impressed with Jesus. Then just a couple chapters earlier after bungling, trying to say the smart thing through most of the book of Matthew, we finally said something smart. Remember in Matthew 16, Jesus is like, who does everybody say I am? He's like, I don't know, muddered mumble mumble, maybe this guy, maybe that guy. And he's like, yeah, what about you guys? And only Peter is brave enough to be like, all right, let's just do this thing. I know nobody wants to say it because there have been a lot of messiahs and stuff and they were all crappy and everybody's mad about it and it always turns violent and weird. But let's just call this what it is. You're the Christ, aren't you? You're the Messiah, you're the Son of God, right? Am I right? And Jesus is like, death. Nice job, Peter. And then he gives him this great blessing that had to feel awesome for Peter. But do you remember what happened right after that? Then Jesus is like, okay, well, now that we have the Messiah thing nailed down, I feel like I should give you a heads up that in completion of those same prophecies point to me as a Messiah, I am going to be executed and raised on the third day. And Peter is like, no way, man. I am not letting that go down. I am so committed to who you are and what you're about. I will hack anybody to death who tries to mess with you, paraphrases mine, but it's not entirely a paraphrase. And Jesus is like, ah, get away from me, Satan. And so Peter then turns around in the next chapter and is like, ah, man, I still got to wear that Satan albatross around my neck. I got to find an opportunity for redemption. They go up on a mountain and Jesus is transformed and looks like God and stuff. And like the most impressive people in the history of the religion show up. You got Moses, you got Elijah. And Peter is like, this is my chance. I am not going to crap the bed in front of these two. And he jumps up and he's like, I know what needs to happen. We need huts. And it's like, uh, no, we don't need huts. Come on, Peter, you're embarrassing everybody in front of Moses and Elijah. And so now Peter has the double albatross over this point, maybe it's like 20 albatrosses that he's wearing around his neck, but he's trying and you got to be at least sort of sympathetic to that. And Peter doesn't completely butcher it when he gets asked the question about whether or not to pay the temple tax. So maybe there's some improvement here, but then we get into chapter 18 and Peter's a great big kid. He's the teddy bear who wants to get things right and occasionally wants to stab some Romans or temple assistants. And Jesus says some stuff. It sounds really profound. Everybody's like, wow, when things get difficult in this new family of faith, even though Jesus isn't going to physically be with us forever, somehow he's still with us partnering when we have to go through these hard times. That's profound. There's this union between God and man like this. And then Peter's like, Hey, question. I had something actually that I thought might be helpful right here. And in verse 21, we get this gem from Peter, then Peter came to Jesus and asked, Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me up to seven times? And clearly what is happening here, given the character of Peter, the larger context we're looking at is that he's drawing on some kind of cultural expectation that the original audience would have had for how forgiving is really forgiving. In the same way, you've got opinions about what is a good tip. I remember when I was a kid, 10% was a really good tip. And then 15% became standard. And now I get those machines where people are like, now the machine is going to ask you a question. Like, come on, it's not the machine asking me the question, but whatever. And 20% is the lowest one and you can go up to 30. So there's a debate that rages on like, how does tipping work? What is socially appropriate? What means you did a good job and I'm being cool and not a cheapskate or a chump? Likewise, it would appear that there was some kind of ongoing cultural debate about like how much forgiving should you do that existed among all the people? And probably some people were like, I don't know, like once is probably good after that, like shame on me, right? Isn't that other saying goes? What it looks like, and I've heard this repeated in a ton of sermons that I've sat in on, it looks like the number that got landed on somewhat officially at this time was three. Three is the generous number by which to forgive or maybe four. Now, here's how we get to that. I wasn't sure if this is another one of those Bible rumors that just gets repeated a whole bunch or if there's actually any truth to this idea. It looks like there are a couple of quotes from well after the fact that get cited somewhat, but I'm not sure these quotes seal the deal for me in terms of cementing like this is exactly how people thought about forgiveness. This first quote dates to like the amount of time that America has been a country out past the time of Jesus. I'm not totally sure how culturally relevant things would still be that far out, but you're getting close to 300 AD when you get this quote from Rabbi Hanina. I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong. This says, one who seeks pardon from his neighbor need do so no more than three times. To me, it looks like this teaching is saying that you shouldn't make somebody ask more than three times before you're obligated and you have to give that forgiveness. So it seems like that's not actually analogous to what we're getting in Peter's situation here, which is how many times should you forgive somebody who gets stuff wrong. And there's another quote that runs to within about 150 years of the life of Jesus 150 years after from someone named Rabbi Ben Judah that says, if a man commits a transgression once he's forgiven, second time forgiven, third time forgiven, the fourth time, no, he's not forgiven at that point. And then there are some references to Amos. Now I did find some other corroborating evidence suggesting that the number of forgiveness sees that should be granted for the same offense or similar offenses is drawn from the opening couple of chapters in the book of Amos. There's a structure in the first two chapters of Amos where there are these prophecies about these different cities, these different people groups, and they all start with the same formula. It goes like this, for three sins of Gaza, even four, I will not turn back my wrath. And there was just pick another one. Chapter two, for three sins of Moab, even four, I will not turn back my wrath. And it does that six, seven times something like that. And so it looks like maybe the rabbis have latched onto this and said, okay, three times, God forgives that four, and it gets a little bit maybe at that point. Well, three plus four, not a mathematician, but I'm 80% sure that is seven. Is it possible that what Peter's doing here is he's coming to Jesus and being like teacher, I am also into forgiveness. Just like you, I'm in. I won't go three or maybe four. I'll go three plus four, equaling seven, which is a ton more forgiveness. I say again, we always pick on Peter because the text kind of intends us to pick on Peter. He's the point of view character. He fails big in the ways that we would fail if we were courageous enough to go big. But you know what? This was pretty progressive for somebody in that moment in that situation at that time. Some of Peter's big swings have connected. So he takes another big one. But look at this and I'm like, okay, Peter, I see your little kid heart on display here. Cool. You're trying to go above and beyond to say that you get it and you're on board. But then Jesus answers. I tell you not seven times, but 77 times. Now, obviously we need to break that 77 times thing down a bunch more and there's a whole parable coming up. And that's what we're going to be talking about in the upcoming episodes. But the point would seem to be a lot on ending forgiveness as you are forgiven so much. So you should forgive much as well. The insecurities and the vulnerabilities and the floundering of the point of view characters like Peter, they get us to these big teachings of Jesus that prompt these big teachings. I like to linger on that stuff a little bit because if I take that extra second to see myself in those insecurities to see my kid heart in the kid heart of Peter, then it's a lot easier for the stuff that Jesus is going to say next to sink in in a way that gets past my academic intellectual armor and gives me something to work on. Think about process at a much deeper level. I'm hearing back from a whole bunch of the international patrons right now and it sounds like you are getting the notebooks that I mailed you. So that makes me very, very happy. Hopefully we got all of those bases covered. I did have one or two that just came back all tattered up after weeks and weeks. And so if you still didn't get yours and you've been a patron, shoot me a note because probably yours is one of those that just came back in tatters and I will package you up a fresh, pretty new one and get that out to you right away. Thank you to all of you who support the program at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast. You are why we get to do this. All right. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt.
