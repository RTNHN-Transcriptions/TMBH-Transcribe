It just keeps coming up and that stuff gets in my system. I remember when you used to play Tetris when you were a kid and if you played long enough then you'd look at the world and the buildings you'd be like, I would squeeze that in right there. You'd look at some desks with the way cars are parked and you're like, no, you got to rotate that? Yep. There you go. Right in there. Oh, great. Yeah, you parked that one. That's a three-liner. I like that way your brain gets programmed. I've got a bunch of stuff like that coming out of our conversations together. I remember back when I was working on Matthew and we were talking about the later parts of Jesus' life and people would say things to him and he had this habit of replying to the true statement they said that they meant to be evil or critical of him, but it was accidentally true. It was kind of by your own words and he would say something to the effect of, you have said it is so. I started implementing that with my friends and my family whenever they would say something that is true, even if it was kind of a jokey way, you know, you have said it is so and just leave it at that and some of my friends catch it and some don't, but I have a good time with it. So that's been introduced by Jesus, the guy for whom the religion is named. It's been introduced into my everyday parlance and then most recently I've added a new thing to I guess how I communicate now because of the influence of Haman and Xerxes, you know, people you really want influencing you deeply on a daily basis. But over the last week or so, whenever my kids come to me and they really need an answer on something, but it really isn't that big of a deal. I'm like, all the things you're proposing would be fine. Any of these outcomes would be great. That is totally cool. I just I don't want to own the final decision, whatever, but I understand that you kids can't move forward without my authority behind whatever decision you make. I just take off my wedding ring and hand it to them and or hold it out to them. I haven't taken it yet. I'm like, there just go. This is my signet ring. You have issue the edict. Make it so that's going to be great. And I think they get it. I don't know if that's actually how you're supposed to use the Bible. It's rubbing off on me in that way. But as I look back on this Esther chapter three situation and the handling of Xerxes authority and the edict that ensues, I'm reminded that this might be a dangerous practice I need to reconsider because when you tell people they can make a decision with your name in your name and with your authority, they might say dumb things. And I'm just breaking down the elements here as I'm looking at this this afternoon of Hamans decree that he wrote in the king's name. And I think it merits one more conversation because it is stunning what Haman presumed to do with Xerxes indifference. I mean, really he repackaged Xerxes indifference toward Hamans request as though it were Xerxes insistence as those Xerxes felt very strongly about these things. So bear in mind in Esther chapter three, the conversation that happened is Haman goes to Xerxes and says there's a certain people. He doesn't even say which ones and they're scattered all over the place and their customs are weird and they're different than other people and they don't obey the king's laws. Now at no point is Xerxes like, could you give me some specifics on that? What laws aren't they obeying? There's no specific reference whatsoever. It's just a lazy, broad general accusation. And then he comes to a conclusion and tells the king how he ought to feel about it. It's not the king's best interest to have them around anymore. So if you're cool with it, let's just issue a decree to destroy them and I'll pay you a whole bunch of money. Does that sound good? And then literally all Xerxes side of the conversation is in all of this is that he takes off his ring, which I'm now physically doing. And he hands it to Haman, the aggregate, the enemy of the Jews. He's like, yeah, keep the money. Do with the people as you please. That's the whole conversation as we have it presented. Not much, not a lot of careful, strategic thought, but this is how Haman represents that conversation, holding the king's signet ring to everybody else. Note the contrast. Starting in Esther 3, 13, dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews, young and old, women and little children on a single day, the 13th day of the 12th month, the month of Adar and to plunder their goods. A copy of the text of the Edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality. So they would be ready for that day. Remember Xerxes officially in this quick little impromptu, not very attentive meeting with Haman signed off on. Yeah, I guess you can punish a people group if you think it's best, whatever, cool. But to his empire and all of his subjects, this is what it looks like Xerxes said. And might I just offer a little bit of criticism of the writing style here? Hey, what are you doing? Destroy, kill, and annihilate? I feel like any of those could take the place of the other two, right? I mean, destroy somebody, at least in this context. I think everybody would mean like, okay, I guess that means kill them. Annihilate, I think of that as definitely mean, kill and destroy. I mean, it's just a tremendous amount of emphasis. Like he's really getting this driven home. I mean, it sounds like the kind of thing that maybe a young boy would say when he's working on the art of smack talk, playing a video game on the internet, like, come on, team blue, let's go destroy, kill, and annihilate them. And then he doesn't really have any peers to hold him linguistically accountable to be like, come on, Craigland, that's a little bit redundant. I mean, just, I guess that's just kind of the stuff that you say. So that doesn't strike me as very impressive. But he does go out of his way, sort of Anakin Skywalker ranting, psychotically, to young Natalie Portman, come on, named Padme Amidala in Star Wars movies. But I killed all the sand people, young and old women and little children. So he made it pretty damn clear in the previous sentence that we're going to kill him. You're going to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews. But then he wants to make it even more clear that all the Jews means all the Jews, young and old women and little children. And then we're going to do the whole thing on one day. So Haman's making it clear, you know, as everyone will understand it, as being Xerxes is making it clear that we don't want this thing stretched out over like a week. We want one bold night of action. This whole dang thing needs to go down real quickly. Everybody in the Empire is just going to need to take the day off national holiday. You're just going to need to go kill the young, old women, little children, all the Jewish people. And that's what you got to do. And then of course, you make sure to emphasize that we're going to plunder their goods. And I imagine this is the incentivizing part of the edict that it was like, well, what do we get out of this besides not killed? And how Xerxes is going to know half a world away over here, whether or not we made sure to kill at least one Jew. We've got to get one of them. How will Xerxes ever know that? And maybe some people were like, oh, I don't really want to do that. I think I might not kill any Jews because of how that's murder and genocide. And I wouldn't want somebody to do that to me or my people. Maybe some people were thinking that, but maybe if some of them were a little bit morally on the fence, I don't know. Maybe I'll just get a stick and like run around and raise my arms and like yell. Maybe I'll kick over a trash can that day or burn some paper outside, yell some remarks. Maybe if they were on the fence like that, thinking that to themselves, maybe they get to the end of the edict and they're like, oh, we get to plunder? Like armies get to do where he's going. You fight some people and you win a battle where the outcome was not known in advance. And then you just get to take all of their stuff and nobody can stop you. Oh, wow. That might be an opportunity to really change my family's fortunes moving forward. I mean, I was 55 45 no before I got to the end of the edict, but I mean, if there's plunder and it is an order of the king. I mean, maybe I could fudge a little bit on my moral standards and participate in this thing. Maybe that's what the thinking of Haman was in terms of how he wrote this. I mean, certainly the theme of plunder is a very interesting one here because when we're first introduced to the agigites, the Amalekites, when we're way back in the desert wandering coming out of Exodus, their motivation for picking off the Jewish people when they were vulnerable and out and wandering in the desert was like a plunder all of their stuff. Plunder seems to be at the heartbeat of the tension between the two with the Amalekites trying to seize the opportunity to kill the Jews and take all their stuff a thousand years earlier. And now here we are again having come full circle, even though this is technically an edict of the persons who theoretically have nothing to do with this age old fight. It's actually an edict of an agigite, a Malekite, and it's just an unsettled score. It's more of the same. Maybe the attentive reader is supposed to catch that and be like, wow, this wouldn't be going on if when the Jews were told to fight back and defeat these people once and for all they'd actually done it instead of the way Saul blew that and tried to preserve them for the sake of milking them for tribute or additional plunder down the road. So maybe they would read into that as well. But whatever the case, we're just talking about the edict here today. And what I would say is this, if I'm Xerxes, I'm honestly a little bit irritated and a little bit embarrassed at the quality of the edict. It's redundant. It's churlish. It sounds childish and competitive. Like weak stick smack talk. It sounds oddly vengeful. It leaves a lot of questions in the mind of the person who reads this edict. Like if it's important enough to genocide these people in 11 months from now and we already know that, why aren't we doing it right now? And also, why is whoever wrote this so mad? There's nothing even in here that says what they did. The whole thing. You really think that I'm going to commit genocide just because you offered me money. But on the other hand, as we read along, we'll discover that there were some people who wouldn't have noticed any of the problems with this edict who just hated the Jews so much that they were like, awesome. I don't care how bad your writing is. I don't care how dumb the plan is. If you're telling us that we get to kill this people group we don't like and take all their stuff, we're in. Yeah, I don't know. I guess if I gave somebody my signet ring and they barfed out, slop this poorly put together, put it in every language and put my name on it like I wrote it. I might think twice about giving people my signet ring and permission to write in my name in the future. But that didn't occur to him initially. The king that is because all the couriers went out and then the king and Haman, they just sat down and got a drink. But everybody else, they were bewildered because this is held out as being some really important thing. But we just looked at the edict carefully and it really doesn't make a lake of sense. Hopefully yesterday you caught my invitation to Rapid City, South Dakota on September 25th for a great big giant 1000 episode party that we're going to have. We filled up a bunch of those rooms that we have reserved at that cool downtown hotel where I'm going to be staying the Alex Johnson Hotel. So if you are thinking about coming, you might want to make a reservation over there. Remember to tell them that that is under the TMBH room block. But either way, whether it makes sense to stay at the Alex Johnson Hotel with us or not, I'm just hoping that some of you can make it work with your schedule to come out and hang out. I am in the mood to take internet things and do more of it in human space. I miss people. It feels like we're all very distant from each other these days. And I know this is weird and maybe even not advisable per the best practices of how you do podcasts, but I don't care. It feels so one-sided and I just really like to hang out together a little bit. So thanks to everybody who signed up. Hopefully more of you will have the chance to do so. Jeff's got the link down there in the show notes, but it's the TMBH.com slash event. And that link will get you to a place with the details about the thousandth episode event on the 25th of September, as well as the TMBH pastors mini conference that we're doing on the 26th the next day for anybody who's involved in ministry stuff and wants to hang out with me and talk about that. Wait, wait, wait, one more thing. I forgot to tell you, Jeff Foote is going to be able to be there as well. So you're going to get to hang out with Jeffrey who does all the music and everything as wildly talented and likable person to be around. So that'll be a fun connection to make as well. All right. Now that's it. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
