And I think my parents, I think my parents are awesome. I think they were awesome. I think they're still awesome. It was a great upbringing. I thought it was an upbringing in a certain era with certain sensibilities and times change and things happen and meanings change. And somewhere along the way, being around a lot of Christian stuff as a kid, I started to feel like the prayer before meals thing was a little bit obligatory. The prayers weren't usually terribly insightful or even formulaic. It just kind of happened. It was probably good in its own way because you're saying that we acknowledge God and we're thankful even if the prayers are a little bit stale or whatever. But by the time I got to college, interesting is Jeff Foot, the guy who edits the podcast and does all the music so well, his cousin was a guy I went to college with. We were at a Christian college. I think all of us were coming out of the same kind of experience and background. And I remember one day we were sitting there at the table and he does a big dramatic folding of the hands. I'm like, that seemed a little bit much. And he bowed his head deeply and squinted and crunted. Dude, okay. That's way too much. It took me a minute to catch on to that he was lampooning some of these habits. And then I heard him start to mutter under his breath. Seven, eight, nine, ten. Amen. And then he put his head on like, Oh, I see what you're doing. Okay, that resonates with me. Yes, prayer can become perfunctory. It can become a thing that isn't terribly well thought through. It's probably better than not prayer at all. I don't know. They still pray before meals. Sometimes out loud, sometimes not out loud. Sometimes I forget. I don't know what I'm doing. I told him not to go to praying. I still figuring stuff out a little bit later on in life. I was at an event and I saw somebody go up to pray and they had written the thing out. And I, you know, about my head did the thing you're supposed to do. And the guy starts praying. I'm like, he's reading a script. You can't read a script and you pray. What are you doing? And he keeps reading it. And as soon as I got past the distraction of him doing it wrong, I was like, dang, this is really thoughtful. There is no bloat here. Every word matters. Every word is bibaly. There's an awareness here of where this prayer and this moment fits in the grand scheme of the history of the world and the church and the Bible and dang, this is really good. And I wish he'd go slower because I want to process this and understand it and in whatever way I can, I want to pray it to whatever that means. And it was done. I thought, well, dang, that gives me some new stuff to think about in terms of how prayer works and the intentionality of it. I think we're running into a guy who prays not a lot like I did with my meal prayers growing up and praise a lot more like that guy at that event to carefully thought through what he wanted to pray when we encounter Nehemiah. Nehemiah is a very smart, very thoughtful prayer. And that's why we've spent, what are we at now, a week or so just looking at how the guy prays. And specifically this rather jarring, rather shocking prayer of condemnation directed at his enemies. And we wouldn't do that if it were throwaway prayer. I mean, if you and I get a meal together at the hardies and before we start eating, I'm like, oh, I should probably pray. Hey, I'm going to pray. You know, God, thank you for food and time together. conversation be edifying to you and you know, amen. Look, all of those things are fine. It's good, but we're not going to do a podcast five years later where we take a week and break down my hardies prayer. We all know it's just an acknowledgement. If this Nehemiah stuff, it's more than that. These are prayers that demonstrate that this is a guy who gets where he fits in the grand scheme of redemptive history and the Bible and all of that stuff. He prays Bible all the time when he prays, even when he's praying stuff that emotionally might feel a little bit ugly because it's confrontational and it's conflict oriented prayer. But you and I observed that in the first prayer we looked at back in Nehemiah chapter one, he was channeling stuff from Deuteronomy 30. He was channeling stuff God had said about what happens if someday you people violate the covenant with me, but then realize it and repent of your sins and turn back to me. Well, I'll restore you even if you're in a land far, far away. I'll restore you to this. That comes through. Now, aware of that, it's present in Nehemiah's prayer in chapter one. And now we're looking at this prayer here. Us. Oh, our God for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. Wow. Okay. That sounds a lot like some of the prophets who have come and gone in the 150, 160 years prior to the writing of this book. And then we get to the last part of the prayer. Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders. What he is invoking is all of the corpus of all of God's language in all of scripture up to this point in the composition of scripture that is judgment oriented. He's drawing on all of these different places where he gets a sense of the tone of what God's judgment is of what God's justice is all about. And he's repeating that stuff back to God. And in Joel chapter three, we get a whole chapter about God judging the nation since what's going to happen to them. Now he says, the Lord says at that time, I'll restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem. Oh, okay. Nehemiah is probably thinking like Ezra did as well. We're in this phase where this is the time where God will restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem. Nehemiah probably imagines himself, I think rightly to be an agent that God has raised up in the restoration of the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem. It goes on, I will gather all the nations and bring them to the valley of judgment. Oh, there I will judge them for all they have done to my people. More. They've scattered the Israelites in foreign countries and divided Israel. My land, that kind of language right there sounds like this was written before the Persian exile because I'm not sure that language would make sense after Ezra, Nehemiah is a rubable and all of the stuff that we've been reading about here after the age of Cyrus with the restoration of Israel. But you know, that's just an aside. They threw dice to decide who would get the captives that kind of rings a bell with the Esther and Mordecai theme of the Purim and also the idea of casting lots later on for Jesus garments of the crucifixion. You're getting the idea of an I want to read you a little bit more, skipping ahead a bit. It says, thousands and thousands are in the valley of judgment. It is there that the day of the Lord will soon come if there's one phrase to associate with the book of Joel, by the way, it's the day of the Lord. That's the central phrase, the central theme. The sun and the moon grow dark and the stars no longer shine. The Lord roars from Mount Zion. His voice thunders from Jerusalem, earth and sky tremble, but he will defend his people. Think about where they had been for the previous generations. I mean, even when Jerusalem sort of getting rebuilt, the walls still aren't working to gates are burned out. And yet this kind of language exists. These kind of promises are ringing in the ears of these simple people out rebuilding their respective chunks of the wall or Nehemiah as he's trying to organize this whole effort. This is very powerful language. This relatively modest, relatively small people group being backed by the one true God who roars from Mount Zion. Dang. It's stirring for me. And I'm not ethnically a part of this people group. Then Israel, you will know that I am the Lord your God. I live on Zion, my sacred hill. Jerusalem will be a sacred city. Foreigners will never conquer it again. At that time, the mountains will be covered with vineyards and cattle will be found on every hill. There'll be plenty of water for all of Judah. Stream will flow from the temple of the Lord and it will water the acacia of valley. Egypt will become a desert and eat them a ruined waste because they attacked the land of Judah and killed its innocent people. I will avenge those who were killed. I will not spare the guilty, but Judah and Jerusalem will be inhabited forever and I, the Lord, will live on Mount Zion. I just got done watching Dune and then Dune 2 and I'm reading it. I just captured my attention. So I'm going to go read the book by Frank Herbert and this theme of the power of a prophecy, of a restoration of a dead land through the power of a restoring character is the undergirding theme of the whole thing. It's what motivates and drives so many of the actions of the character in the story. I think the same thing is the case here. Look at these guys were aware and I believe they were of what I just read you. It's going to give them a ton of confidence and it's going to inform what they're doing, particularly Nehemiah, which would cause him not to feel he has crossed any threshold of inappropriate judgment as we talked about yesterday to look at his enemies who were trying to derail the redemptive plan of God, trying to derail what Nehemiah perceives to be the clear and obvious work of God and getting this thing rebuilt and his people being restored in the way that God has promised that they will be restored. These people are the enemies. They are in opposition to the plan of God and the will of God. We're not here to kill them. We're not here to hurt them or do any or here to build our thing and defend ourselves. They are the aggressors and we call on you, God who we believe is orchestrating this whole thing and keeping with the spirit of what you've said to the prophet Isaiah, to the prophet Joel, to the prophet Ezekiel to so many others, we call on you to bring justice to the situation. Yeah, we judge that wrongness is being brought against us. We assess and discern the situation and see that this is evil and this is wrong and this is opposed to you and this is unjust to us. That we call on you, God, to resolve the situation. It is a very thoughtful prayer drawing on a deep knowledge of the language of Scripture and the ancient promises of God on the part of Nehemiah to not just say, oh, yeah, well, we have insults for you guys too. You all are jerks are things better than your thing. He doesn't stoop to that. He goes right back to God turns right back to the authority of God and in the same way that Jesus did in Matthew chapter four and Luke chapter four, when being tempted, every answer that Jesus gives to defeat the insults, the accusations and the temptations of the enemy is he just goes back to the word of God. He says, I mean, man's not going to live by bread alone by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord. Then Jesus goes on to just draw on Bible stuff to counter every verbal flourish that comes from Satan in the desert. So Nehemiah seems to be doing the same thing right here. He's digging deep into what God has said and he's using that as a way to oppose what these guys are doing and to call on God to bless their effort and to judge and to crush this opposition. This is a very intentional, very smart, very thoughtful prayer with a ton of layers. And you know what? There's not a dang thing wrong with the prayers that I was raised around. They were fine. And there's not a dang thing wrong with my hypothetical hearties basic food acknowledgement prayer that I mentioned. It's fine. But at the same time, there's not really a whole lot to talk about. We get it here. There's a lot to talk about and a big part of the reason that we've spent so much time talking about it is because I don't want this to deteriorate for us into a conversation about two squabbling factions from a long time ago. Let's not bicker about who killed who these people didn't like. These people nobody locked anybody back then. It's really hard to pick sides that really say who was right. No, I think this is different. I think Nehemiah is right. Jesus says that Nehemiah's side in this situation is right and Sanbalat side is wrong. Nehemiah in the way he prays is appealing to that. Not just to say, God help my team win because I like the nuggets and I don't like whoever they're playing. He's praying in such a way. So as to say, we are functioning with the assumption that we are operating in keeping with all this stuff you have said about the unfolding of history, about the unfolding of your redemptive plan. And these people are operating in opposition to it. It's a prayer to God, but it's also a declaration to everyone around as to who's in what position and that this is more than some silly territorial squabble between a couple of Bronze Age people groups that nobody really knows much about anymore. Anyway, taking the time that we took on this prayer is going to help us understand the conflict that runs through the next big chunk of Nehemiah better. And hopefully it will help us avoid viewing all of this with a chronological aloofness, just dismissing both parties as equal squabblers in a little territorial dispute. Nehemiah thinks it's bigger than that. I'm inclined to agree with Nehemiah in that regard. And I'm excited to go check out how it plays out with you in the coming conversations. Right. That's it. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
