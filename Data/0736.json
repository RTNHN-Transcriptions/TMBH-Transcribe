This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. We're talking about Simon of Cyrene in Matthew 2732, where it says, as they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon and they forced him to carry the cross. This is about the only thing we hear about Simon. We get maybe a minor detail here there from the other gospel writers, but he's a dude who pops onto the screen and then pops off of the screen and that's it. So why did Matthew even tell us about that? Why did he leave these details? What additional themes or layers of meaning might be sitting there for the taking if we think a little bit more about Simon of Cyrene or Cyrene in general. So yesterday we were talking about the region he's from, Cyrene or Cyrenaica. So right now we need to pick up where we left off and see what else there is to know about this place. The Cyrenaica is another one of these Roman provinces. This just doesn't really come up a ton in the Bible, but Simon the Cyrene is not the only time we hear this name. In Acts chapter two, Luke, who probably traveled to Cyrene at some point goes out of his way to point out that some of the people who were there at the day of Pentecost, when everybody becomes Christians, that they were from Cyrene. There's also a reference. I could not tell you for sure if it's at the Jerusalem Council or maybe a little bit before that, but somewhere in the middle of the book of Acts, there's a list of prominent leaders in the early church. And one of them is a guy from Cyrene. I think his name was Lucius. I could have looked these things up. That would have been responsible, but you have Bibles in the internet. You can go figure that out and see if I got it right or correct me if you need to. And the fact that in the very early going of the church, you would have a prominent Christian leader from Cyrene suggests one of two things. Either Simon of Cyrene had a very impactful experience here and went back home and told people about what had happened. There is certainly a tradition suggesting he did so in Northern Egypt, West Egypt, even into Cyrene, Cyrenaica, Libya, whatever we want to call it, or that those merchants, those people who were just there in the marketplace on the day of Pentecost, that they went back to Cyrene as well and told people about what had happened there. Also, the time between the crucifixion, which was around Passover and Pentecost, Penta, it's 50 days. So I don't think you're getting on a boat and sailing all the way from Cyrenaica to Jerusalem to be there for a long weekend. I mean, you're going to be there for several weeks doing business or whatever you're up to. So it's entirely possible that when Acts chapter 2 says there were people from Cyrene there, they were just talking about Simon of Cyrene, who I think his two sons are named elsewhere in another one of the Gospels. So it's possible even likely that Simon of Cyrene was both there for the crucifixion as well as the birthday of the church, the day of Pentecost, the arrival of the Holy Spirit, in which case, surely he went back after seeing those two events and was like, okay, there's something going on over here. This is a big deal. And he would have had a concept of that because remember, the whole idea of the Jewish Messiah was something that had shaped the history of Cyrene. An upstart Messianic claimant had altered the relationship between Cyrenaica and Rome. And around the time of the Barcocca revolt in the 120s, 130s, 140s, I don't remember exactly when this happened, there was another Messianic revolt in Cyrene under the leadership of a guy named Lucuus, and the result was another Jewish persecution in Cyrene that was similar, though not as widespread as the persecution that would come on the heels of the Jewish revolts of the second century. So you got Messianic stuff going on about a century before Jesus in Cyrenaica, then you've got people coming back with reports about the Messiah that are specifically in response to Jesus himself. And then on top of that, a hundred years after the time of Jesus, maybe just a little bit less, you've got another Messianic thing going on. So what that tells me is that even as someone who is by no means an expert on this particular little region, I can still say with confidence that the Jewish presence there was one that was of such a theological persuasion that they still thought the Messiah was a thing, they were still interested in that. And we can also deduce from this that the Messiah watchers in Cyrene had something in common with the religious leadership in Jerusalem, and that they imagined that if there was to be a Messiah, the Messiah would deal with the great evil that was the Roman occupation. But that's weird, isn't it? Because the Roman occupation of Cyrene was totally different than the Roman occupation of Judea, and Cyrene was a gift. It was just bequeathed from the descendants of a Greek general way back in the day. I mean, Macedonia, but effectively Greek. Whereas Jerusalem, that wasn't the deal at all. I mean, it was kind of a weird, sweetheart negotiation between a sort of Jewish family, that being the people who came before Herod the Great and some up and coming Roman politicians, that kind of slicked their way into ownership of Judea. So there it probably and quite immediately felt a lot more like a military occupation by force than it did in Cyrenaica. Anyway, just for fun, not that it's totally relevant. I went and did a little bit of reading about what happened to this region after because I would assume that it got conquered by the Muslims in those seventh century conquests that I was referencing the other day. And that is the case. It got overwhelmingly taken by the Arabian conquest. However, I thought this was really interesting. There were a couple of communities, one in particular whose name I don't remember, who continued to be Byzantine in governance. That is, they were associated with Constantinople, Byzantium, the seat of the Eastern Church for a really long time after that Arab conquest. I don't know what that means. Just thought it was interesting. You can't tell this because we edited out the pause, but one quick note as well, I did just go and dig around and it looks like over in Mark, we get the detail that Simon of Cyrene was the father of Alexander and Rufus. And that to me points even further to the idea that early Christians who were writing this stuff down knew that Simon of Cyrene was affected by what he encountered and that there's some legacy of faith that continued. Otherwise, I just don't know why you'd know his kid's names. I choose to believe this guy became a Christian that he saw things at the day of Pentecost and that he took Christianity back to his home with him and that it affected things there. I could be wrong, but it's fun to think about why does all of this matter? Well, I go back to what I was saying last time around. It matters because we're trying to get as much of the data in front of us as possible. We're looking for connections and details that will help us understand how the original audience to whom this was originally written might have understood all of this business. And in doing that, I think it's probably pretty likely that Matthew's original Jewish audience was aware that part of the Jewish scattering, the Jewish diaspora included this little province in North Africa. I think his original audience would have known that they had had a failed violent messianic revolt, surely bringing up the name of this particular region would have reminded people or served as a contrast between that world kingdom approach to being a messianic claimant versus Jesus' very different kingdom kingdom approach. What happened in Cyrenaica was playing out very differently than what we're reading about in Matthew 27 with Jesus of Nazareth and, well, his relationship with Rome. I go back also to what I said last time around. I have to think that all of this is intentionally pointing to the Gentile mission that being the idea that the whole family of faith and the whole Jesus thing was meant for everyone all along. This feels like it might also be emblematic of a bit of the passing of the baton from the people who should have been leading the way in the right response to the Messiah to people who shouldn't have had a clue. But remember that motif throughout Matthew of the people who shouldn't be able to see can and the people who should be able to see clearly can't. This feels like we're still playing off of that as well. And another thing that I think often happens when we look at these documents is sometimes we have to acknowledge that the original audience would have had a few questions. Well, what about this guy? I remember him. Where does he come from? Where does he fit in? And maybe a little bit in that Paul Harvey. Now you know the rest of the story kind of thing. Maybe this is just a charming little anecdote and payoff because even though Simon doesn't come up in the rest of the New Testament after the Gospels, maybe he was a beloved figure and people really knew him and maybe some persecution that came along erased some of the memory of Simon's contributions to the early church and the growth of the faith. But maybe Matthew knew that my audience will know who this guy is. And I think they'd really appreciate having the question answered of how did he become involved? How did he come to fit in with this whole thing? Whoa, that's how he fits in. He's a guy who carried the cross. Well, it's crazy. What a connection. Maybe that's part of what goes into Matthew's decision to include this detail as well. Whatever the case, hopefully exercises like this just help us to see the text in more dimensions and help us to keep our antenna out for more connections. And if nothing else, well, it's just fun. Thank you yet again for indulging another historical rabbit trail. We are on our way to Golgotha next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
