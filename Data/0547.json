This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast and I've got a question for you. Where does your head go when you hear me say the word generation? Maybe if some of you just to be stubborn or being like, well, I imagine like generating a new thing. I see what you're doing there. It's not really where your head went. Your head went to like eras of people being born. Like you got this generation and then they have kids and then you got this generation and they have kids and you got this generation. And especially like in the last, how long has it been guys? 50, 60 years, something like that. We've really been into naming our generations and being like, they're all like this. This is how the that generation is. We kind of argue about what name we're going to slap on those generations. But right now, I think the breakdown goes like this. The lost generation, these are the ones who were alive during World War I and there's a whole bunch of death and sadness and cultural confusion. And so they get a really, really sad name. And those are the people who were born like late 1800s up till around 1900 ish. Then the greatest generation, these are the people who were kids during World War I and then went and solved the gigantic modern crisis that culminated in World War II. And then the silent generation, I think these are the people who were just too young to fight in World War II, but came of age while all of that was going on. And then the baby boomers, that's of course, and everybody came back and they had gajillions and gajillions of little babies. And now we're starting to get into recent enough generations that people start to get their hackles up because some people are real mad at baby boomers. You hear a lot of complaining about that in certain political camps during certain political seasons. And then you got Gen X and the timeline on this one is kind of wonky. I think I am maybe on like the very back end of Gen X or the very front end of what gets called Gen Y or millennials. Gen X right now, they're kind of the in the middle of the whole cultural conflict thing. They have some of the characteristics of baby boomers I'm told and have some of the characteristics of millennials I'm told. I don't know that I feel any of that in my own actual life. And so the more hot button generational monikers, of course, the Gen Y, the millennials thing. And this would be like return of the Jedi up into the matrix, like that kind of era right there, be it born in that chunk of time. And maybe this group is just old enough to remember the world changing on September 11th going from what we were before to whatever this is sense and the decisions that are bettors made in response to that. And of course, we're told that the odds, the 2000s had the giant generation war between the baby boomers and the millennials and the baby boomers made memes about how dumb and bad and lazy millennials were and millennials made memes about how dumb and out of touch the baby boomers were and how probably be better if they just died soon. And it was really gross and ugly on all parts. But as far as I know, like most of the baby boomers I knew and most of the millennials, if that maybe even barely includes me who I knew, like most people didn't really hate anybody. It was just a thing that it felt like was always being foisted upon us to divide us not just over how we look or what we have or don't have or where we live or what language we speak. But now we're even dividing each other over when we happen to be born, which you can't really help. And Gen Z seems like nobody really knows what to make of this group yet other than they laugh at different jokes and their music is sort of muddled and sad and confusing and understated and mumbling. And then I'm told that there's some new generation, this generation alpha. I don't know what that even means. And this would be very, very recent. Like these are all really super little kids at this time. Someone I just said probably sounded like total truth to you. Like, yeah, that's how the things are. Other things I just said probably you're like, I don't know about that division right there, but in general, doesn't all of this make you feel a little bit suspicious? Like, this is a bit overwrought and a bit tortured and a bit like we're trying to cram these categories together. Like the strokes almost feel so broad as to be discriminatory. That's not the point why I bring all of this stuff up. The point of why I bring all of this up is to say that if you are alive right now and you are within earshot of this podcast, you have been bombarded with this idea, this notion of what a generation is for your whole life. It is treated as a cipher that can help us explain the differences between age groups and the social movements that are happening and political fights that are going on. And maybe like me, you're skeptical of these things. Maybe you just our wholesale in on it and you're like, yes, that is the meta narrative explanation for everything that is happening. But what we can all agree on is that this is a really relatively recent phenomenon. I mean, there was no such thing as even youth culture per se, before like 1920, 1910, the idea of the high school rite of passage, all of these things are so, so new. You go back a couple thousand years. No one was thinking about generations the way we think about them now. No one yet when we see that word generation pop up repeatedly throughout the book of Matthew, we instantly and I think understandably are going to jump to how we've been conditioned to think of that term. But if we do so, we can run into a massive problem in terms of how we understand the Bible and specifically how we understand what Jesus means at the end of chapter 23 and into chapter 24, because how we read this very pivotal chunk of Matthew really does pivot to some extent on how we understand the term generation versus how they understood the term generation. So at the end of Matthew 23, we're finally landing the plane on these woes that Jesus is pronounced against the Pharisees and the religious leaders. And he says in verse 35, and so upon you religious leaders, Pharisees come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barakiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. I tell you the truth. All this will come upon this generation. And then in the high point of the next chapter, chapter 24, he says, now learn this lesson from the fig tree as soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near right at the door. I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. And that language right there comes on the heels of some pretty significant pronouncements about how time is going to unfold. So as you can see, well, what does generation mean? Well, if it means generation like we think of generation in such a proclamation, we're made to quote millennials, then the literal interpretation of Jesus words would be, well, okay, those people are all born by the like the late 90s. If they live to be real, real old, that would be the late 2090s. So before the year 2100, all these things literally will come to pass. That would be the natural way to read it. But if we read generation in a first century context and it means something a little different, then we might not be able to put so neat and tidy a timeline on this whole thing. What we can say with clarity from this remark without even diving deeply into the word generation yet is that Jesus is landing the plane on a final pronouncement of judgment against these religious leaders. He's made these seven woes about he's saying you religious leaders, you Pharisees will be the narrative completion of the actions set in motion and perpetuated by all the people from your intellectual and spiritual tradition who came before you, all of their murderous behavior, all of their rejection of the purpose of God for the people of God. That is on them. You guys are completely in keeping with such behavior and you're going to round that thing out. You will fill up then the measure of the sin of your forefathers. The question that hangs out there with the word generation being in play is when. And the way to get to the bottom of that is to dig into the different places where this word generation occurs throughout the text of Matthew and think a little bit more about how the original audience would have understood its use here. For some bizarre reason, some of you have decided that you want to support this podcast, which is humbling and awesome and makes this podcast happen. So thank you, thank you, thank you to everybody who supports the program. If for some strange compulsion, others have you decide that you would like to join them in that you can do so at patreon.com slash the TMBH podcast or you can also not. That is also completely cool. Thanks for having the conversation with me. I love that we get to do this together. A mat. This is the 10 minute Bible hour. Let's do this again soon. Let's do it. I, I, I, I, yeah.
