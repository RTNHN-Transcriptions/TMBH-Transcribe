This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and by my count, this is a year and we're on Matthew chapter 11. I've been working on Matthew for a year and we're through 11 chapters. Hopefully that isn't discouraging to you. That's encouraging to me. Well, let me put it this way. It's encouraging to me that the number of you who are sitting there having this conversation with me has grown as much as it has to such a tremendous degree. And it's even more encouraging that we're only through 10 and a half chapters of the book of Matthew, the book we've been working on the whole time and that more of you keep wanting to participate. The reason that's cool is because any time you do a one sided media like this, there's a degree of self selection. There's a feedback loop. Even if I don't hear from you all that much, there is a feedback loop because if nobody's listening, I stop doing it. I'm like, I just got to go way faster. So maybe people will be interested. But when you're grinding through the material with the ebb and flow of the deeply historical passages where we're off talking about Roman emperors and ancient Near Eastern magic practices and who knows what? And then we get into deep water, theology, speech the next week and we're looking very closely to try to parse out what Jesus is saying in this phrase or that phrase. I mean, that's a dramatic ebb and flow. It's a very deep dive. And yet here we are with a whole bunch more of us hanging out together, having this conversation a year after we started than when we did start. So for those of you who were here on day one and you've been here every day since then, I am giving you the gold star sticker of perfect attendance. And if you get the gold star sticker of perfect attendance two years in a row, then you are going to get a pizza party. And the pizza party is something that you can have at the time of your choosing at your own expense and you can invite whoever you would like. But you cannot have that pizza party yet. You have to have perfect attendance for another year. But congratulations on your one year perfect attendance star. For those of you seriously who've been here from the beginning, you're awesome and I like you. I'm talking more about that in just a second. For those of you who have jumped in along the way and gone back and binged through the whole thing, I've heard from a lot of you who have done that. Thank you. What an enormous commitment to say, I want to understand this book of the Bible better. I want to be a part of this conversation. I'm going to throw some extra time at it to get up to speed and jump in. To those of you who were here for the first time or you've just been hanging around for a little bit, you're like, I'm still sizing it up. I don't know if I want to go back and catch all the old stuff or not. Hey, whether you jump in part way or go back and pick up the old, whatever the case, you're here and we're hanging out on the internet. In the time we're hanging out together in any capacity is a pretty awesome, pretty redeeming thing. And I think it's even awesomer that we are a diverse group of people who think very different things. I mean, I know there are a ton of you who even reject the most basic premise of the document we're studying, which is the idea that there is a God and that there is a God behind this text. And yet here you are churning through it with those of us who look at it and say, no, I think there's something supernatural about this thing. I think there is a God behind it. My point is it's been a cool year and I like you. And I know that might seem like an odd thing to say because most of us have not interacted, but I do like you. And I feel like I'm informed in saying that I like you because there is a feedback loop. If I am putting stuff like this into the microphone and on the internet every day and you are still here hanging out with me, that means you're a person who cares about ideas, you're a person who's not snobbish about the fact that we live in the here and now, but you have respect for what's come before us and understand that what has come before us has made us us and you want to unwrap that and understand it better. If you're still here, it also means that you have a sense of humor. Sometimes because you're laughing at things that maybe happen here that are sort of funny and sometimes because you've got a good enough sense of humor to just roll your eyes and move on when it's not funny and it's dumb, but I'm laughing at myself. The bottom line is I know I'm putting out deep dive daily Bible content and there's a reason that there's not a ton of that floating around in the podcast world. The fact that you have an appetite for it and you have an appetite for framing the conversation this way. And the fact that you have an appetite for it, even understanding that we're probably not going to agree on every single little detail and we can just be cool with that and like each other anyway, it makes me like you. I put this stuff out, you consume it, tells me that we have a lot in common and I appreciate you and I enjoy your company as weird as that sound. So thanks for showing up all the times that you've shown up and lighting a fire under me to keep doing this and to keep thinking about this. And even though I've said thank you probably much longer than I meant to say thank you with this one year anniversary episode, we still have Bible to get to. So let's get cracking on that. But here's your high five for being awesome and for doing this with me for a year. Okay. So I'm the oldest kid in my family and that means that I get a little extra responsibility, but also that means I get a little extra scrutiny and a little extra protectiveness from my parents growing up. And one of the things that happened when my younger sister and then later my younger brother came along is that they would leave me in charge a lot and I would do stuff. And at times I tried to push back on mom and dad flex my argumentation muscles a little bit and be like, well, you didn't get mad at Mark for doing the exact same thing. What the heck? And they'd be like, Mark's a baby. You're old enough to have responsibility. He's a baby. He poops himself still, but you can't possibly want to be compared to him. We expect more out of you because more has been put into you. Now, come on, get it together and quit making excuses. And I had great. I have great parents who were always equitable and always fair. And I think a wonderful job staying after us. Just the right amount, loving it up on us and taking it easy on us, just the right amount. And the way they handled this little logical maneuver that I tried to make with pointing to how they treated my brother is just one more example of how great a job they did at parenting. They swatted that crap aside because it's nonsense and intuitively, you know that argument is nonsense as well. Common Sense says that anywhere in life where a whole bunch of responsibility and trust and effort and training and resources have been poured into someone or something. You expect more out of that someone or something than you do out of someone or something into whom no resources have been poured yet. Likewise in Matthew chapter 11, Jesus is making the case almost in this soliloquy in front of a bunch of people that a whole lot has been poured in to the immediate crowds he's been interacting with. A whole lot has been poured into the people of this generation who he is talking with and doing miraculous things in front of a whole lot has been poured in. It's been poured into Capernaum, the town he operates out of, and Bethsaida and Corzine and these other local towns that the disciples even went out into in chapter 10 and did miracles in front of these people. A whole lot of resources, a whole lot of investment. There's thousands of years of God interacting with his chosen people. These people you have the profits. You guys should be able to see it. But in spite of all of that investment, Jesus sorrowful tone here is and yet somehow you're not getting it yet somehow after having it put in front of you more clearly than it's ever been put in front of anyone ever in the history of ever in the history of God's redemptive plan. Tonsy were still completely missing it. The passage goes like this. Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed because they didn't repent. Wodaiyu Corzine Wodaiyu Bethsaida. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed entire inside on, they would have repented long ago and sat cloth and ashes. But I tell you, it'll be more bearable for tire inside on the day of judgment than for you and you, Capernaum. Will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you'll be thrown down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. We're going to break down the historical significance to the original audience of all of these different locations that Jesus references here tomorrow. But to put it succinctly, tire, side on, and Sodom had seen way, way, way less. They were babies who still pooped in their pants. Nothing was expected of them. That was a metaphor. If you didn't listen to the first part of this episode, that was probably really confusing to me. But just roll with it. It kind of works. They were infantile in their thought because things that would make it abundantly clear that the kingdom is real and the king is here and God is doing this redemptive plan and they should be a part of it. They weren't done entire inside on and Sodom. Well, it's like one thing happened in Sodom, but there wasn't a lot of opportunity for them to observe that and then be like, oh, that seems great. We should probably follow God now because of how they were burned with sulfur from heaven. But you get the idea. So there's a quick setup for the passage we're going to spend most of the week thinking about again, in the same way that my parents expected a lot more of me when I was an older kid than my little baby toddler brother who was a younger kid because more had been invested in me. I had seen more. I had been trained more. So Jesus is clearly expecting more of these towns right in his home base and he is marveling with sorrow at how astonishing it is that these things can happen right in front of them. And still they can't see it. There's so many implications to this and so much for us to unpack. And we will get to that as the week unfolds. Remember earlier when I was like, hey, thanks for listening to this podcast. And for those of you who've been here for a year, thanks for listening. I still think that I've once again to all of you and double high five to all of you who jumped on the Patreon, patreon. What is it? Dot com slash the T M B H podcast to make this thing go for the year that obviously has been a huge difference maker in terms of our ability to grow this thing and progress through this thing together. Y'all are awesome. We'll have a real fun time with a real sad passage moving through the rest of the week. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again.
