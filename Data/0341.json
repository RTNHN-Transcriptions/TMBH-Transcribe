This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and I saw a video the other day of a little baby raccoon that goes down by the water, and it's like, oh, I found some food in a trash can, and I'm just going to wash it up and then eat it except the food jokes on him. It's cotton candy. And so he takes the cotton candy and it dips it down in there. Of course, the cotton candy just vanishes because of the physical nature of cotton candy, and the raccoon is like, what is happening? My entire world has just turned upside down. Like if you saw an alien or something, that's how the raccoon looks. And my little buddy, my son, he loves the raccoons and that makes him super happy. That video made us super happy because when he was little, we'd always badger him about washing up for dinner and stuff. I'm like, the raccoon's doing you like the raccoon? You got to be like the raccoon. And he washed up his hands and all of these things just make my heart soft and squishy. But I bring them up because they do have to do with what we're talking about today, which is quite literally hand washing. Which in our family was the thing that was just a matter of you not being gross and disgusting because you're a kid and you go outside and you play and you get gross and disgusting. And then obviously we don't want you to get whatever diseases you touched outside by eating in your food. So we have you wash up. It's just common sense, right? In some cultures and particularly in Jewish culture at the turn of the century in the time of Christ, it was not such an adorable little pre-meal ritual. The people who took very seriously the teachings of the Pharisees viewed a ritual washing before any kind of meal as part of one's expression of religious devotion to God and even an extension of the rules on religious purity and ceremonial cleanliness that we get in the law in the first part of the Old Testament. So what we find out real quick is that you got a whole bunch of people who are like the adorable little raccoon and no matter what they wash everything except unlike the raccoon, it's motivated by religious things. And then you have apparently some other people who just never caught on with. And Jesus doesn't seem to have inflicted on his disciples an expectation of ceremonial hand washing as part of the equation. So we are in Matthew chapter 15. We're going to get through probably two whole verses today. So let me read them to you. 15 one, then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, why do you disciples break the tradition of the elders? Why don't they wash their hands before they eat? Yep, we're going to have an entire Bible fight right now that ultimately is going to get so heated that Jesus ends up being executed in the most grisly of ways. And part of the Bible fight that leads to this is about hand washing before meals. No joke. So we can do one of two things at this point, my friends, we can assume that everyone who lived before us is a giant idiot who's thought stupid things and behaved in ways that were basically insane and just write it off as crazy and move on and be like, Jesus is good. Other people bad or even though we might disagree with the Pharisees after working through this question, we can assume their sanity. And in doing so, try to consider where they're coming from. So this is another one of those conversations today where we try and wrap our brains around what the Pharisees are doing. But before we do that, a couple of quick narrative notes. We got Pharisees and teachers of the law. So two different sets of representatives coming up from the religious headquarters in Jerusalem. This represents an escalation and it's very important that you catch it because the original audience would have caught it immediately. Let's say that you are from where I am from, South Dakota. It's not a real big state. It's kind of out in the middle of nowhere. That's sort of on purpose. And if you were hearing a story that was written by a South Dakota to another South Dakota and it was like, well, there was this big hubbub up in Deadwood and then this happened and some folks came up from Rapid City to check in on what was going on there. And then some people from the governor's office came by like, you'd be like, oh, well, that's escalating a little bit. But if it was like then some important leaders from Washington, DC or New York came out, you'd be like, whoa, okay, wow, this little thing that happened in the mountains and the black hills of South Dakota, it made its way all the way to New York, Washington, DC. It escalated to that point. You see these geographical locations for you and me trigger levels of severity or significance just by merit of the name of certain locations. Likewise, saying that these people came up from Jerusalem would have really caught the attention of the original audience who were like, whoa, there are lots of people who make religious claims. Galilee is kind of known for that. There have even been a lot of people who took a stab at trying to claim that they were the Messiah explicitly or implicitly over the years and didn't merit a ton of attention for Jerusalem. Except maybe once or twice. And now we're sending up entire delegations. This is a really big deal, but contrast that with what these big important delegations are coming to talk to Jesus about. I mean, they made this whole trip over land. It takes a long time to drive. How long did it take to walk to Capernaum? They walk all the way up there, presumably in their fancy outfits. They get there. They get everything set up and they're like, we have a question. And it's about handwashing. It's like, seriously, you walked that far to ask them why he doesn't wash his hands. I mean, okay, whatever. Well, here's what would motivate them to do that. You got this thing that gets called sometimes the law. Sometimes it gets called what it does here, which is the tradition of the elders. Sometimes it's called the oral law. Usually if you hear the qualifier oral put on the front end of the law, that means that everybody involved is acknowledging this is not part of the law that was written. Down in what we call the Old Testament. This is a parallel law that grew up alongside it in the tradition of the rabbis and the teachers of the law and the scholars and the sages who thought about such things. Well, this was in full swing by the first century A.D. And for many of these religious leaders, the tradition of the elders was tantamount to the actual law. Now, we do get language in the Old Testament that is about purification and washing up and things like that, but not really language that applies to everybody. So I can't think that the Pharisees would be going up to somebody who's capable of teaching the synagogues in Jesus, somebody who knows his stuff and thinking that he's just not going to know what is and isn't in the written law of the Old Testament. I've heard it proposed that the Pharisees were referencing something in Exodus 30. I had to write that down. I did not remember the passage and then I did not write down the verses. Here it is right in the middle. 17. I've heard it proposed that this passage is maybe what they were referencing. I'll read it to you and you can see what you think. Exodus 30 17, then the Lord said to Moses, make a bronze basin with its bronze stand for washing, place it between the 10th of meeting and the altar and put water in it. Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet with water from it. Whenever they enter the 10th of meeting, they shall wash with water so that they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by presenting and offering made to the Lord by fire, they shall wash their hands and feet so that they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come. Well, I mean, there's that language at the end about lasting ordinance. Maybe you could look at that and be like, oh, so this is for everybody. But it really seems to specifically say a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants. Now, in the context of Exodus, when we're talking about Aaron here, we're talking about the people who would handle a lot of this temple business. There's no language in this passage that indicates like a casual meal with friends or really a meal at all. This looks like it is part of the ceremonial law. Remember, we talked about the different divisions, different aspects of the law, several episodes back. This looks like it fits into that and it doesn't look like it would apply to the general public. So I think the Pharisees were smart and competent. And I don't think they would be trying to make a case that Exodus 30 is what this is drawn from. I think they would be making the case that right alongside the written law immediately began to grow up this oral law tradition. Now, obviously we don't have any kind of written documentation of this parallel tradition growing up from the very beginning to the outsider looking in. It certainly appears like it was a later invention. That is the oral law that was designed to answer more specific questions. Josephus, the first century Jewish historian, does speak to the Pharisees and their brand connectedness to this oral law. And he does so in the Antiquities of the Jews, book 13. I think I'm in chapter 10, nine, no, 10. And he says something like this. This is Josephus talking about the Pharisees. What I would now explain is this, that the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances. The print is tiny on this book. Hang on a second. By succession from their fathers, which are not written in the law of Moses. And for that reason, it is that the Sadducees reject them and say that we are to esteem those observances to be obligatory, which are in the written word, but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers. And concerning these things, it is that great disputes and differences have arisen among them while the Sadducees are able to persuade none but the rich and have not the populace obsequious to them. But the Pharisees have the multitude on their side, but about these two sects and that of the Essenes I have treated accurately in the second book of Jewish affairs. So the extra biblical evidence squares precisely with the chosen language of Matthew, which is apparently a quote, probably a fairly accurate quote of the Pharisees. The Pharisees are not claiming that this is the written law. They are claiming that it is this parallel law, the tradition of the elders, yet nonetheless. They think it's a big enough deal that their first chess move in this game with the retinue that has come, the, you know, the ringers that have come up from Jerusalem, their first chess move is not one from the written law. It is one from the parallel oral law. Now we get a clue from Josephus as to why they might have gone this route. The Sadducees were popular with the rich. The Pharisees were popular with every man. They're going to every man territory. And so they're going to make an every man play from the every man part of the law, that being the oral tradition and see if they can drive a wedge between these people who are hit it off with Jesus and Jesus himself, along with his disciples. So hopefully that gives us enough framework to actually get into the substance of the accusations and Jesus very complex, multifaceted response over the next couple of days. But as always, I like us to be in the habit of trying to earn the ability to comprehend what is being debated here. Because if we don't do this little bit of background work, at least for me, is really easy then to just say, like, I'm confused. I don't totally understand what's going on. So I'm just going to inflict modern assumptions onto the text. And then I end up with weird conclusions that aren't in keeping with what Matthew was going for. But it's not the book's fault. It's my fault because I thought about it all in entirely modern social context when it isn't happening in a modern social context. It's happening half a world away for me a couple thousand years ago. And that takes a little bit of extra work. And one of the things I like about you, based on the merit of the fact that you are still here, is that you are also up for that little extra bit of work. So thank you. Hey, here's something pretty cool. We've got just about all of our shipments in on everything that we are sending to all of the patrons, literally any patron supporting at literally. Any level at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast is getting mailed this cool little Matthew Field notes book that fits in your pocket. And you can jot down notes about what we're talking about here. And it's kind of like this neat little visual metaphor for having the book of Matthew in your hip pocket. So I'm very excited to get all that packaged up in the coming week or so and start mailing that out. If you have not updated your address and you are a patron, please do that. So we make sure to get it to the right place. All right, everybody. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
