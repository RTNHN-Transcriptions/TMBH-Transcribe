This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we're in the middle of a two-day conversation about historical Galatia and which Galatians in particular we're talking about when we talk about the book of Galatians in the Bible and it's possible that what we've been looking at here in Acts 13 and Acts 14 is the beginning of the Galatian church that is in view in the book of Galatians. So I'm gonna have Jeffrey play some music and we're gonna pick it up right where we left off yesterday. The Galatians, if you will, were a group of Gauls who migrated to extreme Southeast Europe in the three and four hundreds BC. So all the way back into Persia and Alexander the Great Time, there's even talk that maybe one of these Gauls, these Galatians were involved in the assassination of Alexander the Great's dad. Well the Galatians eventually migrate down into modern day Turkey and they occupy North-Central modern day Turkey or like the 12 o'clock if you think of Turkey as like a clock. And they're there for a long time but they maintain linguistic distinctiveness. They speak the trade language which is Greek, that's why it would make sense to write Galatians in Greek but they also have their ancient golic tribal languages as well. So this is really a unique group of people here and a few of those people and a few of their customs migrate south into the southern half of the hourglass-shaped province of Galatia and there's a less pronounced historically ethnic golic presence in the towns that we just looked at that the first missionary, the proof-it journey, went through that being in Piscity and Antioch, Derby, Lystra, Iconium. These are still Galatian cities in terms of the province of Galatia but ethnically the presence of the historic Gauls here is not as pronounced. So it's kind of like if you go clear up to northern Italy, everybody speaks German and they got German Christmas markets up there and it just looks like the German or Austrian Alps. There's still Italian stuff. If you just dropped into Bolzano Italy out of a plane, your first guess would not be Italy. Your first guess would probably be something more Germanic but you're still very much in the political region of Italy in northern Italy and it's just culturally it looks a little different. Well same thing here if you can picture the situation in northern Italy then you can picture what's going on with this hourglass. It's all Galatia in terms of a Roman province. The northern half is historically ethnically culturally linguistically tribal Galatia and we don't know for sure that Paul ever even made it up there. Maybe he didn't. Maybe he didn't if so probably on the second missionary journey. The southern half of the hourglass where we are with all of these things and where people tried to say that Paul and Barnabas were gods and tried to sacrifice to him and then we're like oh okay if you don't want sacrifices then here's a sacrifice of rocks. I was just stowing you in your dumb heads until you look basically dead and drag you out of the city. All of that stuff happened in the southern half of the hourglass so there's a little bit of golic culture and language there but mostly it's going to be more Greekish there even though it still has the title Galatia. Are you picking up what I'm putting down? What I'm saying is it is possible that you and I have just read through the chunk of the Bible over the last few days where Paul established the Galatian churches to whom he is writing the book of Galatians. That is an increasingly popular opinion over the last 150 years and I tend to lean that way but historically dating back to when people had a little bit more of a natural sense of who lived where and what different parts of the Roman world felt like culturally. Back then people were more likely to say oh well if you're talking about Galatia nobody's talking about the southern half of the hourglass you'd be talking about where the Gauls live and the Gauls by the time this stuff is going down I mean they'd been there as long as the English have been in the United States of America it was pretty well established at that point. So the old theory is that Galatians is written to the northern half of the hourglass and we don't really know much about those people and we don't really get an account of how those churches were founded. The more recent theory that I find to be more compelling is that it's written to the southern half of the hourglass where there's a little bit of golic culture but it's definitely inside the boundaries of Galatia the province and ultimately I don't think I'm going to be able to settle it. I mean we'll see as we go along I don't write the whole season in advance I'm going to learn along with you as we go so we'll keep putting things on either side of the weights the level the ledger here and see what conclusions we might arrive at at the end but it's very important for me to pause and note right now as we wrap things up in this first missionary proof it journey that there's a really decent chance at what we just saw as the founding of the church that Paul is going to be writing to in the book of Galatians. No okay so bearing all of that in mind let's finish out this proof it journey this first missionary journey we're going to pick it up leaving Lystra where things got pretty bad and everybody's like oh you guys are gods you're the best and they're like no we're not and they're like okay then we're hitting you with rocks until you're dead if you won't be our gods jerks then it almost works it looks like they almost managed to kill Paul but ultimately he and Barnabas regroup and they leave for Derby Acts 14 21 Derby is another town in the southern part of the hourglass all of this is in the southern part of the Galatian hourglass here we go they preach the good news in that city that's Derby and want a large number of disciples then they returned to Lystra Iconium and Antioch what the heck just gluttons for punishment so this is an important little geographical note here on this proof it journey this first missionary journey they retraced their steps so Paul in the future if you were saying the second time I visited you there in Lystra for example if Paul were to say that he could easily be talking about still the first trip then say when I came back through that would be the second time he visited just worth noting so they went to all those places they strengthened the disciples and encouraged them to remain true to the faith we must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God they said turning the page Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and with prayer and fasting committed them to the Lord in whom they had put their trust that's verse 23 of Acts 14 very important detail right there because that's part of that cycle I was telling you about right they go to a town they talk to the Jews and the synagogue some like it some don't the Gentiles are often very into it and then resistance comes in sometimes violent resistance then Paul with whatever time he has left he establishes elders establishes a church and he's on his way and then the letters that make up the rest of the New Testament so many of those are just him writing back to churches that he helped found and to the leaders of those churches who he helped put in place because they all became Christians when Paul was there you know old Christians it was all brand new do still on the grass fresh and minty and really in a way it was kind of a miracle that many of these churches survived at all I mean it seems like a crazy way to go around spreading Christianity yet so often seems to have worked after going through Passidia they came into Pamphylia we're still in the bottom part of the hourglass of the Roman province of Galatia and when they had preached the word in Perga they went down to Atalia Atalia I still don't know from Atalia they sailed back to Antioch where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed there we go the proof-it mission the proof-it contract is now over they went pretty well Paul and Barnabas no doubt when they got back everybody at Antioch was like oh it's Paul and Barnabas it's good to see you guys but is it possible that you are more scarred wounded bloodied and bruised to the one I saw you look like you've aged about 10 years are you guys doing okay oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you got stoned basically to death but we're fine and on arriving there they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles there's your proof-it it wasn't just Paul and Barnabas on this trip there were a lot of people and they're all saying the same thing we saw the same stuff Peter's vision the stuff that happened with Japa and Cornelius the Roman centurion the Gentile yeah it's all real it keeps being confirmed we're seeing this in the field we got boots on the ground we went out and looked at it and this is definitely happening it's real apparently everybody's just excited about it in Antioch okay this makes sense well now we know for sure this is what's going on more conversation needs to be had but it's so good to have you guys home this is great and it says and they stayed there a long time with the disciples and that's the end of chapter 14 and now remember a couple days ago we talked about after a one-year prove-it deal if indeed the player goes out and proves it well now you got to come back to the table and talk about what that means and how we move forward together and that is what acts 15 is going to be about so there we have it once again there's a decent chance the story that we just wrapped up right there is the story of the founding of the Galatian churches that we're reading about in the book of Galatians and if so I mean if that's the story that is in the background of all of that wow it's pretty dramatic and it'll probably come into play as we read through the book all right that was a fun couple of days acts 15 is next and then I think we hit the hyperdrive and we're pretty much going to fly through the rest of acts massive overview style and then we're into the book of Galatians proper pretty quick here couple final notes one I still haven't figured out the YouTube thing it's very weird I don't know what's going on there I'm talking with people who were smarter than me about what we do about that might have started a new channel I don't know it's okay it's the internet whatever I really like the video we made I'm really grateful for all of the kind feedback I got from you we'll figure out what we're doing and I'll let you know as it comes into focus thank you though again for all the encouragement on that that's been kind of a goofy situation and then the final final final thing is it yesterday when I was giving you the whole hypothetical asking you to envision the trip that I took with my family during the Bush administration to the park in New York I told you to close your eyes and last time laying in bed I'm like oh no this stretched out into a two-part episode did I remember to tell them to open their eyes because that would be really bad I hope you just took initiative if I didn't and you were like I'm opening them this is stupid I don't have it's a podcast I don't have to do any of this if not wow I respect your commitment you should probably open those now I'm at this is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.36, "text": " Hey everybody, it's Matt.
