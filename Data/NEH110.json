That's a little too critical or just any habit that I wanted to change, getting rid of something negative, embracing something positive. But then I don't do it. And I don't do it again. I'm like, all right, this is the last time that you're going to whiff on this. I'm moving forward, we're going to get this right. Okay. And then it's 50 times before anything changes. It's just it's hard to change, right? We get into ruts, we get into habits. I'm hoping that you're the same way. If not, I'm just out here emotionally naked before all of you admitting to my flaws. Well, every other human involved in this conversation, it's like, why are you kidding me? No, I want to fix things. I just decide to fix things. And then I fix things. And they're better after that, in which case, dang it. I look even dumber than usual. But on the outside chance that you're like me, this is human nature, right? It's hard to fix stuff. We get in ruts, we get in grooves. And sometimes it's not even out of ignorance. Sometimes we know we're not doing things the best way they could be. This is not the ideal version of ourselves. And we even tell ourselves it's time to make a change, time to fix that. And it just doesn't happen. But then what about the times when it does take, right? We could sit around and complain about the bad stuff forever. But at the times, when you looked at something that was going on in your life, you said you needed to change it. And then you just made a decision to change. And that was it. The cold turkey, even you look back and stuff was never the same. I'm guessing that all of us have something like that in our lives too, where we actually got stuff straightened out. And sometimes it's the weirdest little thing that will get me or maybe you as well to a point of that change. Now some big dramatic epiphany or anything that is just a right day. It's the right moment. It's the right conversation. It's the right thought or language. And it just clicks. And it's like, all right, well, it's done with that thing. I think the apostle Paul is kind of talking about that kind of stuff, that kind of change moment just sort of happens in 1 Corinthians 13, the passage that everybody gets cross stitched for them when they get married. It's a rite of passage. It's totally a thing. And at the end of that, he's talking about how, you know, when I was a child, I did childish stuff. But eventually it put childish ways behind me. He's not describing a big dramatic process. It just changed. Then the time was right for that change. We've been in Nehemiah 8 for a long time. And I've been telling you, both overtly and subtly overtly by me saying, this is a big deal. It's a huge deal. And subtly by how long we have lingered in Nehemiah 8, I've been telling you, I think this is a turning point. I think it's a huge, important chapter and passage in the Bible. And there's still a lot of stuff to still come out of the impulse of Nehemiah 8 through the end of the book, but I've kind of been fixated on Nehemiah 8. Because I think this is one of those national turning points. I think this is a moment where the people finally pull something together. And if you're following the narrative, the plot of the whole Old Testament, you get worn down with how much they are unable to ever really lastingly pull things together. They always go right back to the idolatry and embracing the destructive evil vile ways of their neighbors. And so you sort of get immune to these occasional ovations, like the ones we've been looking at of late about, I'm totally going to change this time. I'm totally going to change. I'm totally going to change. And if anything is discouraging because you can relate to it, because you can think of times when you were saying, I'm totally going to change, I'm totally going to change, I'm totally going to change, and then change that didn't happen. But here, the formula was right. The perfect cocktail, the perfect mix of circumstances, the perfect confluence of events and soft-heartedness, and the right moment in history, it all comes together for really meaningful change. And I think this is great and worth lingering on because so much of the Old Testament, the takeaway is, and then things were awful again after that, and the people were very wicked. And the way we can relate to this is that aren't we terribly wicked to, and it's true. I mean, it's a lot of what you take from the Old Testament. But here, there's a transformation that occurs, and it occurs because of soft hearts and open ears, and because of a re-familiarizing themselves with God's law and a willingness to humble themselves and go live in tents. I don't think that's just performative. I think it's actually a really meaningful gesture and not a brand new innovation in the MI8. It's tapping into an old thing that had meant something for a long time. It's just a spectacular moment. And after this, things actually do change. They never go back to the idolatry. They never go back to the mistake that has bit them in the butt again and again and again through the whole thing. There was a can of Reeves movies about baseball. I want to say it wasn't rounders, right? Rounders was the gambling one. What was it called? You're going to remember somebody's going to tell me, is a can of Reeves gambling baseball movie, right? And he's a youth coach because he gambled too much. And the courts are like, you have to go coach a team now. That's your punishment. It feels like it's setting up to be sort of a bad news bears kind of joke fest, but it's a really pretty serious, pretty thoughtful movie about this guy really struggling to kick this addiction, this gambling addiction that keeps biting him in the butt again and again. If I'm getting this wrong, it's been 15 or 20 years since I saw this one. I don't remember the name properly, but nothing else. This sounds like a movie that could exist with the can of Reeves. And I don't remember much about the movie, but I remember how I felt. And it was, and you're rooting for this guy. You want to see him pull it together. He gets so many things right. There's so much promise, but this one thing is a Achilles heel. It's his vulnerability. It keeps biting him in the butt. And I think the thoughtful viewer upon watching whatever the heck that movie was with the name that I don't remember is going to watch that show and be like, I got a couple things like that. A habit of mind, a habit of action, a little place where the pride always wins a thing that if somebody puts me in that position or as they say this, I just can't help but react the wrong way, whatever it is, you can react to that character because everybody's gotten a Achilles heel. Then of course, when you see a character going through that, especially with something you don't struggle with, I mean, I've never had a thing with gambling. I don't understand the appeal, but I know it eats some people's lunch. You sit in there watching it and you're just going, oh, it's so easy from the 10,000 foot view is the spectator to just be like, dude, just simply don't do that anymore. Then everything will be fine. You're rooting for him. And I would like to believe that in the end of that movie, the name of which I don't remember and the outcome of which I don't remember that finally he gets over the hump and he defeats the thing. Maybe through the lessons he learns from the court appointed kids he has to teach how to play baseball. Does that sound like a way that that might end? I don't know. That was probably not the right example to go with, but I think you understand what I'm talking about. And it feels like what's going on here. The same stupid thing keeps kick and the Jewish people's Israelites, the Hebrews, the descendants of Abraham's butts again and again and again. They keep being suckers for it. They keep falling for it. And as the reader, you just want to be like, they're all fake guys. Like all of the neighboring tribes, hot chicks, gods, they're carved out of rocks. They don't do anything. They never do anything. One of your prophets straight up made fun of them for pooping and that's they're probably in the bathroom. That's why they can't do any miracles right now. They're mockable. They're laughable. They're ridiculous. It's a fake narrative made up out of whole cloth. Whereas your God is held out in the text. This breaking the laws of time and space and showing up in all the clutch moments and being completely worth dedicating your life and your identity to come on, figure it out, figure it out, figure it out, but they don't figure it out. Really until now, coming out of this event, this music festival style beast of booths week long Bible reading festival that they do, they never go back. They don't go back to the idolatry. Doesn't seem like this would be the kind of thing that would defeat that and cure them of that constant lust for false gods who affirm whatever they wanted to be instead of the true God, whose character and standards are timeless and unchanging and make them feel often uncomfortable and resentful. Nope, it sure doesn't seem like this is what would cure them of that at all. But history tells the story that it does. Now, do not get me wrong. I'm not saying that from Nehemiah 818 on that everything just goes perfectly in Judaism. I don't think any Jews would say that for crying out loud. I don't think anybody would say that the rest of the Bible, you know, all the people who follow God, the children of Abraham, they're all totally faithful from there on out, and then everything was fine. Everybody lived happily ever after. No, not at all. In fact, what we're going to see that happens over the ensuing 440, 460 years leading up to the main events of the life of Jesus is that they immediately screw it up the other way, just like we do. As soon as we kick a habit or a problem, it's very tempting to immediately be so above that problem that used to eat our lunch and kick our butt. And now it's like, yeah, well, you know, weak people struggle with that and almost despise people who wrestle with the thing that we just got right. No, this sense of rigorous religious legalism and pride kicks in and replaces the former indifference. And I understand how they got there. And I understand that this legalism was well intended when it started. But Jesus himself, who's the authority on all of this stuff, shows up in 450 years and more or less says with even harsher words than the ones that I'm going to use here toward the end of Matthew, he's your religion is metastasized. Your well-intentioned self-control and good behavior has metastasized into something grotesque, cancerous and dark. There's no life in it. It looks pretty on the outside, but on the inside, there's just death. So Jesus is no fan of what this impulse evolves into. But there's good things about what this impulse evolves into as well. Even if it's a prideful desire to follow God, it's at least an attempt. And at least there's an interest in it. And at least it's a different kind of broken than the kind of broken we've seen in the past. And I just don't want to be cynical. I just don't want to come out of the Old Testament feeling like this whole thing was just bad. They're glimpses. They're flashes of what happens when people are responsive to the character of God and the word of God and the law of God. Good things come of that. You're not supposed to get done with the Old Testament and wash your hands of the whole thing and be like, that's just an entire study and everything being terrible and nothing being fixable. And there's no hope. I just got to hope Jesus shows up. No, God was working in people's lives back here as well. It's just that ultimately human effort is demonstrated in the Old Testament over a very large sample size to not be able to solve the human problem. What the Old Testament is going to beg for in the majority of time when the main human characters are getting it wrong and the minority of time like here, when the main characters are getting it more right. What the whole thing begs for in good times and in the much more common bad times is an ultimate fix to the problem of human sin, human pride, human resistance to God, something that transcends our own willpower and our own decision making that gets all the way down to the level of the heart and that miraculously restores the heart of humankind in a way that can only be achieved by God that pays the penalty for failure and sin and all of the it can ugly stuff and the evil in a way that can only be paid once and for all by God by perfect sacrifice. And so even in the good times, the Old Testament still begs for Jesus and the stuff of Jesus, but in the good times of the Old Testament, there are little glimpses of the reality of the kingdom of God, the values of the kingdom of God, the redemptive stuff about that. It's there. It's just that we see it way, way more fully when the kingdom of God is inaugurated through the work of Jesus. And if you didn't go through that whole Matthew series with me and you want to know more about what the heck I'm talking about here, I recommend listening just simply and very quickly to those 800 episodes. Okay, there's more here that we need to work through in Nehemiah. But before we went on to chapter nine, I just wanted to commemorate this once again, celebrate it and also give a high five to these people who are trying to follow the same God I'm trying to follow, even if it was 2500 years ago, and they got something really right. And I know how hard it is to get things right. I know how hard it is to make a meaningful change when I'm in a rut and a groove with things that are screwed up. And when you see other people make those kind of changes and get things right and realign themselves to the stuff of God, that's really encouraging. So high five to them. Nice job. Onto the rest of Nehemiah next time around. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
