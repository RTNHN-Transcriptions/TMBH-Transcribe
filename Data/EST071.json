It was really fun. I got to help out a little bit here and there. It's kind of an odd season, the way everything unfolded. But the little guy who was playing shortstop and he made a play and it was so heads up and so good. He flagged down sort of a lazy line drive back behind the position at shortstop and then alertly realized that the runner had been sneaking off of second too far and made a sharp throw back to second to get the double play and end the inning and out search such a premium at this level. I mean, nine outs, so win a ballgame at this level. So getting two in three seconds is just amazing. It really was. It was a nice play. Great job. I'm proud of him. Whether that ball stays in his glove or not, but I could tell he's excited and there's a little talk that happens after the game and he's excited to get to hear his number called for making a key defensive play. And the coach who wasn't trying to be malicious at all just got confused as to who made the play and gave credit to somebody else. And that was kind of at a distance, taking that in and I could see the physical deflation in the body language of my son. If you've ever had one of those, a son or a daughter, you know what that deflation, what that body language looks like. And so sure enough, yeah, he comes over. He's a little bit classy. I had and I was like, Hey, I know, man, I heard it, but I know you made the play. You know, you made the play. There's a lot going on for coach. He's not going to remember every single detail. Don't worry about it. And you know, you got to feel it better and it worked out. But still understandably, even if it's an accident, there is something within us. It feels a measure of injustice triggering when somebody else gets credit for something that probably somebody else deserved credit for, especially when it's your kid. But I'm feeling mountains of that the wrong person got credit frustration over this deal with Mordecai and Haman. What did Haman ever do? He has saved the king or at least that we know of, but Mordecai definitely did that we know of. That was awesome of him. And then the king goes and honors some other dude and doesn't just honor some other dude, but it at least looks like at face value that he honored some other dude who is descended from the age old enemy of the Jews. I mean, that is insult to injury. Think about whatever sports team you like and their hated rival. And just imagine that in some sort of twist of injustice, your team was basically going to win a championship or did, but then forever the other team got credit to drive you crazy and nobody's even getting killed. And that example, but here, and there's blood, there's life at stake. There's this unsettled score between the Aggagites or the Amalekites and the Jewish people that goes back like a thousand years all the way to the time when the Jewish people didn't even have a country. There's wandering around in a desert counting on God to deliver them. And while they're in this very formative, very vulnerable, nascent state, who shows up but their long lost cousin, the Amalekites, and it's not like, oh, we're saved friends. Our cousins have arrived. Hello, Nate. No, no, no. They show up with swords and stuff. They show up to kill him jerks. And so miraculously, the Exodus survivors win as God for whatever reason works through this gesture that Moses is making, which communicates some sort of theological truth that we've chosen not to break down because we're just moving right along. And then at the end of this battle that the Israelites win, God is like, yeah, I have a problem with that and write this down, make a note of it. And I think it's really interesting if indeed we are to understand Haman the Aggagite as described in Esther three as referring to the Amalekites, it's really interesting to me that the first real good look we get at Amalek is this battle in Exodus 17. And then the Lord says to Moses, write this on a scroll is something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Well, that sort of thing, like the annals and records of the king, make sure to write this down because I don't want to forget it. That happens at the end of Esther chapter two in the court of King Xerxes because Mordecai saves Xerxes from that assassination attempt. And so if indeed the author of Esther is drawing a connection between the Aggagites and the Amalekites and Haman and all of that night, I think probably that is the case, then dang, that is a really interesting overlap there. The both of the stories include this annals of the king kind of deal. Well, Amalek, they continue to be a problem throughout the book of judges. They're one of the primary pains in the butt for the Israelites, the Hebrews who have settled in the various allocations of land for the different tribes during the age of the judges, just quick review, not trying to insult anybody's intelligence, but just so we're all on the same page. Remember the Hebrew people, they're in slavery in Egypt, then they go through this 40 year wandering in the desert under Moses, then Moses dies and Joshua takes to the command and they go in and they conquer what becomes Israel. And they divided the land into little partitions. This is very thoroughly covered in the book of Joshua. It's of great concern in the book of Joshua. They divided the land into all these little tribes, but then they don't immediately have a king or even really chieftains. They've got judges who sort of look like they play a little bit of a role, kind of like what Moses used to do, but not really as good at it. And everybody does what's right in their own eyes. The era of the judges, I use this term all the time for it, I should probably think of a fresh one. It's a dumpster fire. It's a dumpster fire on the back of a train that is in a train wreck that is being struck by lightning that is going off of a cliff mission impossible style into a burnout ravine filled with human filth. It's just the most awful set of stories imaginable. Things go really, really badly there. But then after this period of a few hundred years, then the Israelites start demanding a king and they're given a king and that first king is King Saul. Well they've had trouble with Amalek all the way through. The Exodus time, the judges time and into the time of King Saul. Now that there's a monarchy in a kingdom, God commands through the prophet Samuel this new king Saul to go and finally punish the Amalekites for what they have done, how they've been a thorn in the side, how they've been an aggressor, an attacker and an oppressor of the Hebrew, the Israelite people all through the years. And this doesn't come out of the blue. Remember, back in the next, it is 17. It's written down in the annals of the king, metaphorically speaking, that Amalek's going to be punished. The same point is resurrected in Deuteronomy, I think in a couple of places, chapter 25 and maybe somewhere earlier on as well, where there is a notation. No, Amalek is to be punished and I think it sounds really harsh and really horrible. God wants to punish this other nation, but this nation has demonstrated who they are for 400 years by the time we get to King Saul. They've demonstrated that given the opportunity, they will completely genocide their cousins, the Hebrew people, the Israelite people. They will wipe them out and they will pick their bones clean. We know who we're dealing with here. Generation after generation have been the same in this complete and total evil. We don't have the United Nations in the ancient world. You don't have some grand superpower alliance from around the world who will come in if provoked enough and police all the situations. No, you are totally on your own. And if you have an enemy who wants to wipe you out, you've got a serious problem and no one is going to come help you solve that problem. So all of this stuff in the Old Testament, when we get into the level of war and total destruction that we see, it is pretty intimidating. It is pretty overwhelming and it does not square with modern moral sensibilities and it does make me uncomfortable even though I get it. Yet during the reign of Saul through the prophet Samuel, God says, go finish off the Amalekites. And I mean, the language of the text in chapter 14 and chapter 15 of 1 Samuel is not ambiguous. It is a call on the part of God for total destruction of these people who have repeatedly tried to genocide and eliminate the Hebrew people, the Israelite people. And well, look, the Hebrew, Israelite, Jewish people have not been perfect throughout the Bible story or anywhere close to it. And God has punished them very, very harshly for the stuff that they've gotten wrong. But at the same time, the redemptive plan is tethered to them. If the Amalekites succeed in eliminating them, the redemptive plan, which flows through them, is going to get busted up. It's going to get broken. It's not an option. God is going to preserve his people through a whole lot of different means. And now it is time for Amalek to receive their judgment. So at this time, a little before 1000 ish BC, Saul, the first king, the king of the United Kingdom of Israel is told to go and fight against a gag, the king of the Amalekites. And so Saul goes and does that and he wins. And he was instructed very clearly, don't even bring anything back. Just put it all to the sword. There is no plunder to be had here. None. Put it all to the sword. And that's why everything. Again, all of the acknowledgments of the discomfort of that language are present, but let's just keep rolling with the story. Well, Saul does part of it. He wins big time, but he brings a gag, the king of the Amalekites back in chains and he brings back his favorite parts of the plunder. And then he donates. Some of it or sacrifices some of it to God. But through the prophet Samuel, God is like, what are you doing? I give you really clear instructions. There was to be no quarter, no slavery, no plunder coming out of this. Nothing. He specifically says, totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Why? To me, it looks like an echo of the motivation that prompted the Amalekites to forgo their family ties with the Hebrews and the desert and attack them. It's because it was easy pickings for plunder. And that is what motivated them toward this genocidal impulse toward their distant cousins. And it looks like God wants his people to be set apart and distinct from that kind of behavior. And so while God on apologetically and without using nice modern language says, go destroy this age old enemy, wipe them out. The bill has come due. It would seem that he wants there to be a distinction as to why that is happening so that nobody will look at it and be like, well, they're just basically two sides of the same coin, both greedy, both wanting to plunder the other. This was just kind of a tit for that thing. It looks like there is a bigger age old problem here. Well, Saul doesn't follow through on it. Samuel comes along. They have a very difficult exchange. And in the end of all of that, Samuel relays to solve that God has rejected him as king over his handling of the aftermath of his defeat of the Amalekites. And this is what puts us on the narrative downhill slide toward meeting King David, who is, of course, Saul's replacement, the one who now God has chosen. So I think everybody remembers off the top of their head, if you've been through the Old Testament once or twice, that God rejected Saul as king somewhere in his reign. But maybe we're just jogging our memories together here to recall that it was over how he handled his business with the Amalekites that God ultimately rejected. Saul as king. Kind of interesting. Well, that story wraps up with Samuel going and putting to death a gag, King of the Amalekites himself, which is kind of dark. I'm glad that was never the role of a pastor when I worked at a church. And then that's also the end of the relationship between Samuel and Saul. They didn't have any interactions again, and the tension between the two of them has kind of driven a whole bunch of the narrative for the last several, several chapters at this point. And for Samuel 15, so it's a very consequential moment in the Old Testament. And it looks like it's a consequential moment that has echoes on into the future with this Heyman, the Aggagite thing. So again, just to put a bow on that, even though we got one more day of talking about the backstory on the Amalekites and the Aggagites and all that stuff. It looks like, at least at face value, the author of Esther is citing a gag to bring our attention back to the Saul thing in the same way that Mordecai is clearly described a chapter earlier as being descended from Kish. That's also the name of Saul, King Saul's dad. It looks like these two very old names are coming up within one page of each other to remind us intentionally of this age old rivalry, this age old unsettled thing. And to remind us that, Hey, remember this loose thread from earlier stuff in the story? It's still out there. There's still a people group floating around out there who wants to genocide God's chosen people. And this thing that should have been sorted out by Agag and the son of Kish way back here in for Samuel 15, it's not sorted out. And that kind of thing tends to come back to haunt you. And now it looks like in Esther chapter three, it's about to come back to haunt you more on this Agag stuff next time around. Final thought, the conversation at patreon.com slash the Tmbh podcast about what we do next when Esther is done has been. And it's not magnificent. You've pointed things out to me that I have not thought about. You've given me food for thought in terms of not just what we do next, but exactly how we tackle it. I've loved hearing your thoughts in terms of strategy and what would be the most useful and instructive, not just for what's next, but even for what's next after that. Thank you to everybody who is participating in that very formative conversation and everybody who's supporting the podcast at any level. It just means a ton. Okay, these were back to back pretty long episodes, but I'm having a lovely time. We'll see if we can get it back closer to the requisite time limit next time around. I'm so terribly terribly sorry, but not that sorry. All right, I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
