I came back upon Man of La Mancha, which is about Don Quixote. And I learned all that music when I was a kid, because I was raised around music people. My parents are into the music thing. They were both music majors. So they made my entire upbringing one giant music appreciation class. Musicals were a big part of it. I like show tunes. That kind of stuff is catchy. I like musicals in general. But even as a kid who didn't really know how to interpret things or understand how the world worked, when I was watching a musical with my parents, you could kind of tell when they were ramping up for a song because in musicals a lot of times, there's no music happening for a while. It's people acting. They're doing a story, and it's narrative. And then all of a sudden, there's a little bit of piano or strings or something. You're like, here it comes. And then all those extras who were just bustling around on the busy street scene, all of a sudden they start to line up. And it's all happening in rhythm. You're like, all right, here we go. We're going to get a catchy ensemble number, where everybody knows the words and all the dance steps and it's delightful. And then they'll just go back to working or whatever. Well, even as a child, never for a moment did I think to myself, that's so lucky that they all knew the dance steps and they all knew the song. What are the odds? No, I just obviously, you know, somebody wrote this. It's all planned and coordinated. And likewise, in Nehemiah chapter nine, we are about to get a very long, very elaborate prayer that looks like it is being recited by everybody. It's like musical. Everyone just suddenly knows the words to a two plus page long mega prayer of confession. But any sane interpreter, despite the fact that this isn't overtly spelled out in the text knows that somebody wrote the prayer and that the people somehow had either a copy of the prayer written out in their hands, or they'd all been commissioned to memorize it somehow, or maybe they're repeating it back, like a call and repeat kind of thing. Somehow this coordinated everybody knows what this giant prayer is going to be and they are ascending to it and repeating it and reading it together, maybe like a responsive reading in church or something like that. And pretty obviously, given the flow of Ezra and Nehemiah, the person who wrote the prayer is almost surely Ezra, who is leading all of the proceedings that we're reading here. Now, there's a small part of me that is like to imagine like a 1% chance, but this entire prayer that happened here in this passage with everybody in sackcloth and ashes actually had music and dance steps to it. But it probably didn't. It's probably just reading. So here we are. Nehemiah 9 about to get into this big corporate prayer. It's often referred to as a prayer of Ezra, even though I don't think the text once again overtly spells that out. Nehemiah 9, 1 getting into this big corporate prayer. Here we go on the 24th day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together fasting, wearing sackcloth and having dust on their heads. Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the wickedness of their fathers as we discussed yesterday. Oh, quick side note, correction. I have known the story of my ancestry. We got burned at the stake by King James for years and years and years. It's like a whole thing in my family. It's very formative. It's a very big deal. The guy's name is Edward Weitman. And you can imagine my horror when I got a comment correcting me today in the comment section over at patreon.com slash YouTube page podcast where we talk about this stuff saying, Oh, you kept saying George Weitman, but I think you must have met this guy. And it was a link to description of Edward Weitman's life. And I'm like, well, yeah, of course that's who it is. And that's what I said. And then I went and listened to no for whatever reason I just fixated on his son's name, George, and kept using that when I was talking about Edward. And it's a reminder that sometimes these things happen. Could I go edit that and fix it? Yes, I could. But it's way more fun to just let the bumble stay. Then, well, we're all human there it is. So I mean, that's a nice correction that needed to be made in regard to yesterday's conversation about confessing the sins and the wickedness of their fathers. Moving on, verse three of Nehemiah 9, they stood where they were and read from the book of the law of the Lord their God for a quarter of the day. We had a discussion back in Matthew about the hours of the day by Roman rendering and Jewish rendering. I don't think a quarter of the day there would mean six hours, like a quarter of a 24 hour day. I think the original author here in the original audience would have understood that to mean a quarter of the daylight. So let's call that three hours, a quarter of the daylight waking half of the day. So three hours would be my guess here. They stood where they were and read from the book of the law of the Lord their God for a quarter of the day, three hours, and spent another quarter, three hours in confession and in worshiping the Lord their God. Standing on the stairs were the Levites. Here we go. Jeshua, Bani, Kaudmiel, Shebania, Bunei, Sharabaya, Bonnie and Kanani, who called with loud voices to the Lord their God. There was no edit there. By the way, I got that on the first try. And if I'm going to give myself negative credit for screwing up my own ancestors name yesterday, you better dang well believe I'm going to take positive credit for reading that right on my first try. Oh, but here's a whole other batch. I don't know if I'm going to get this verse five. And the Levites Jeshua, Kaudmiel, Bani, Hasha, Bunei, does that count? I think I got it on my, we're going to count that is getting on my first try. Sharabaya, Haudaya, Shebania and Pithahaya dang it. I think I butchered that one. Pithahaya. So they're all standing on the stairs and all of these Levites, all of these leaders, you can kind of picture them maybe fanned out in front of everybody the way you would set up bridal party with them kind of fanning down the stairs symmetrically. And then you have the officiant and the bride and groom up in the middle, maybe picture Ezra, Nehemiah up there in the middle and all of these Levites fanning down the stairs. It's how it's kind of described here. And they all say, stand up and praise the Lord your God who is from everlasting to everlasting. And now, if you have a Bible in front of you, you're going to see that we get into a block quote. There's literally a quotation mark. And in my Bible, at least it's ordered as a block quote visually. In my edition of the Bible, this does a really nice job of setting aside this massive block quote that I think is reflective of a prayer written by Ezra and recited together with everybody all at once with the Levites kind of serving as amplification and guides once again for maybe their individual little pockets of people who they served and who they knew to get everybody to say the same stuff. Now, this prayer isn't being foisted upon them because remember everybody here is already in sackcloth and ash. They've just spent three hours confessing their sins. That's really easy to gloss over that, right? Like, okay, well, they went to church or whatever. And it was kind of a long service. No, when is the last time you spent three hours confessing your sins in private or in public? That doesn't happen very, I mean, I don't know that I've ever done that ever. And they all just got done doing this. So this isn't some prayer that Ezra wrote, he's like, you guys are in trouble. You're going to have to read this thing. You don't get to know what's in the prayer until I pass the prayer. But as you're saying it, then you'll find out what you're praying. No, I think this prayer was deeply reflective of where they were all at already. And I do think this prayer would be indicative of exactly what they were thinking it put to words with poetry and symmetry better than maybe each individual could say it themselves, what they were really all trying to say and what the day and what the week and what all of this, even going back 14 years to the beginning of this process, as we discussed yesterday, had been about. What is the prayer? It starts like this, blessed be your glorious name and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise. You alone are the Lord, you made the heavens, even the highest heavens and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything and the multitudes of heaven worship you. So movement number one here before they get into any specifics about the past or who did what or what they got right or wrong or where they're at now or things they might want. Everything here is first about posturing, assuming a right position before the king. They're already assuming a right position before God and that is one of humility. They look bad. They look dumpy and dirty and humbled and this isn't an everyday thing. Remember Nehemiah and Ezra and the Levites just a page earlier. We're telling everybody, don't dress all crappy and look miserable and cover yourselves in dirt and cry. This is the time to celebrate, but there's going to be another season coming up here in a minute where it's going to be time to dress all crappy and look sad about our sins and to be repentant. We'll get to that in a minute and now we're to that point that they promise. So this isn't like a permanent thing where people are being instructed to go around and be miserable for their shortcomings all the time, but it is the vibe and it is the point of the day that's going on here. So they're in this position of total humility before God. They're not impressing anybody. Nobody's got on their lipstick. Nobody's got their pomade in or their dapper Dan to make their hair look all slick and fancy like when they go to do business dealings with business negotiations for business. Uh-uh. Nobody looks good. They all look bad. They're all more or less on their faces before God. Nothing in what they're praying in this opening movement is we've done some pretty good stuff too. To be fair, you also made the heavens and the earth and ordained everything and all life belongs to you and you created everything. So we both done some good stuff. No, it is 100% about the awesome glory of God. We'll look more closely at this language tomorrow, but this is an intentional statement of orientation. Your God, we're not. You made everything. We didn't make nothing. You are in charge of all life. Everything that exists has been ordained and sustained by you. Nothing is truly sustained by us. You are king. You are God. You are maker and sustainer of everything. Full stop. This is abject humility and face down worship and exaltation of God. It is right humble posture before God, right humble posture before the king and generally throughout the Bible, when we see people adopt this posture in their language and even in their physical posture, literally posture, super good things are about to happen. There's a ton more of this prayer and we're going to look at it more in the coming days. But first, I promised an announcement and there is an announcement. I have got Nehemiah stickers. They're done. I shared a quick preview of those with the patrons last week. They look super cool. There's a stone wall. There's a sword and a trowel. The hologram version of these looks particularly awesome. And as we're drawing to a close here on the book of Nehemiah, it's getting toward time to start sending those out. My last mailing was not perfect. Let's just stick with the tone of the day, whether we're talking about the text or me screwing up the name of my great, great granddaddy yesterday. It's time for just donning our mistakes. And wow, did I make a lot of them in sending out the Matthew stickers last time around. I have brought in help to add an extra set of eyeballs to reduce the human error on my part. My bad. I've been moving, spent a little stressful. That was not my finest showing. I think this mailing is going to go way better. We already have pretty much everything on hand to send anyone who supports the program at any level on any platform, a sticker, Nehemiah achievement unlocked sticker. That'll be gold for anybody who supports in any way. Then as is usually the case, I've got a few of these super limited edition awesome hologram stickers that I send out to people who've gone ludicrously above and beyond. And you know who you are. Thank you for doing that. Thank you to all of you. You're all going to get the achievement unlocked sticker for Nehemiah. You're also going to get the new and redesigned little notebooks for the upcoming series on Galatians. You will have those in hand comfortably before we get into our next season on the book of Galatians. And all of that is the way of saying thank you to everybody supports this thing because it does not exist without you. It's free. So the whole economic model is some of you kick in and you don't have to. So thank you for making this go. You don't have to do that. It means the world. It is my great privilege to send these out. If you would like to receive the achievement unlocked Nehemiah sticker and the newly redesigned notebook for Galatians, it's coming up. You can jump in and support at any level on any platform and make sure to enter your address properly on that so that you can be a part of the six mailing and we can get that off to you. Okay. Repentance is a unique and powerful posture. It's humbling. It doesn't always feel good, but it seems like really good things come out of it. And I'm excited to see what comes out of it next in Nehemiah chapter nine. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
