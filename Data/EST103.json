Maybe that's too strong. We're in a conversation, let's say, that needs to happen. And really everything is stuck until you have this conversation, but it's hard. And the situation is one that's on a razor's edge. And you know it could even come down to just the moment and how things feel and what mood or mindset the person you're talking with is in. If you've been there, I mean, presumably you've all been there. I've certainly been there many times. But let me stretch it further. Have you ever then mustered all of your nerve and courage? You've thought about what you're going to say and you got it all mapped out in your head and you go to talk with this person and some doesn't feel right. I can't really put your finger on why, but this is just not the true moment. It's not the right moment to broach the thing I need to broach. And you size it all up and sure you mustered your courage and sure you put in the work and everything, but it's not right. Abort, abort, abort, abort, abort, abort. And you just call the whole thing off and you decide you're going to wait for another opportunity in the future. I bet most of you can relate to that. Some things in life are a little more objective, but some things in life are subjective and require a little bit of touch and a little bit of feel. And my guess would be even that the people who you and I both know where it seems like everything always works out for them. Their relationships pan out, business stuff pans out. These things just land the right way. I bet that those people have got a really good sixth sense, a really good intuition about the kind of scenario that I just described. And I bet they've got super hyper overly developed metaphorical antennae that are out when they're in that kind of situation to figure out if now's the time to pull the trigger on this given topic or not. We run into one of those kind of very familiar social situations here in Esther chapter five. In Esther four, of course, the crisis, the Heyman wanting to kill all the Jews comes right to Esther's doorstep. Well, it had been right at Esther's doorstep the whole time, but she finally becomes aware. And as we discussed, there are going to be some people who read the events of Esther chapter four and they're like Mordecai. You know, he was just trying to say you got to, you got to do something. They don't think that you're going to survive here in your palace of all of this goes down. I, as we've discussed in length, think that Mordecai is lightly rattling the saber to just say, you have to muster your courage one way or another. They're going to find out that you are a Jew and you're going to get caught up in this thing as well. Come on, Esther, you need to do something here. And that pressure seems to be the thing that causes her to go through her huge growth moment in the story. She emerges. She evolves from that pressure. She comes out of that pressure new and changed. She takes charge at the end of chapter four and is like, all right, well, this is the deal. Let's do it. I will go talk to the king. And hopefully I show up paraphrases mine on the right day and under the right circumstances, something has to be done. Then maybe it'll work. Maybe it won't, but I will go to the king. And if I perish, I perish. I think that's the most famous line in the book of Esther. It's poetic. It's noble. It's brave. It tells the story of the stakes. It tells the story of Esther's growth as a character. And so then in chapter five, the Esther finally, she does it. She puts on those royal robes. We imagine to the scene together of what it's like for her to be walking through those halls, her shoes clicking on that marble floor and she walks right into the doorway where the king is holding court after he hasn't seen her for who knows how long, at least a month. And he receives her, but he's understandably really curious about this little, not breach, but pushing of the boundaries of protocol and they have a friendly exchange. Now, what am I talking about? Friendly exchange isn't nearly enough. The king is very generous in his reception of her chapter five, verse three. What is it, queen Esther? What's your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you. He can see in her eyes and he can see by her attire and he can see by her action that she's in business mode. Something is up here. He's wanting to cash in some of the banked equity that she has earned with the king. She replies, if it pleases the king, let the king together with Heyman come to a banquet. I've prepared for him. Okay. Here's the next hurdle that we have to clear. And once again, we clear it, bring Heyman at once. The king said so that we may do what Esther asks. And to you and me as the reader, where we feel no actual personal stakes, I mean, we're not going to get killed in Heyman's purge. We're reading it from a distance. We care, but I mean, there's no immediate threat to you or me from that seed of comfort. We get to that part in the story and we're like, great. Let's get some resolution. Yep. Right now is perfect. But was Esther thinking that clearly her plan was to peak the curiosity of the king. She apparently knew the inner workings of his mind better than most people. And she knew that taking a bit of a flanking approach to this was far more likely to work than Kool-Aid manning through the door and just yelling at him about what policies he should make or what policies he shouldn't have made. But I wonder if for Queen Esther, now there's this moment of panic. Now the heart goes from flutter to full on pounding as the king's like, yeah, sure, great. Let's do it right now is perfect. Wait, what now? No time for you to do on it. You want to reflect on the banquet that we're going to have and wonder why? No, right now is awesome. You look beautiful and I've missed you and it's good to have you here and hey, I got to eat anyway. Let's have a banquet. And so the text here in Esther five, five makes it sound like it's just immediate. Now bear in the back of your mind. What we were talking about at the beginning, those kinds of situations where you amp yourself up because there's a subjective thing that really it's a huge pressure point in your life, but it's all going to come down to how the other person you need to talk to, the person who really has the keys to your situation here is going to respond to it. Well, now of a sudden we're in warp speed when it says so the king and Haman went to the banquet, Esther had prepared what now? Yep. As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther. Now what's your petition? It'll be given you and what's your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it'll be granted. So he doesn't just say this kind of stuff in front of whoever is in the royal throne room to impress them. Now it's much more intimate and he's still in the exact same spirits. That bodes well. What doesn't bode well is this bit about as they were drinking wine. I don't know. Last time we were in a banquet and he was drinking wine, the queen was interacting with him about his decision making. It did not end well for her. I think there's a very intentional echo back to that point. Lest the reader here a few verses into chapter five. Think well Esther's got it in the bag now. The scepter's been extended. Everything is going to work out. He is drinking at a banquet though. Pump the brakes a little bit here and also remember this seems to be moving at a quicker pace than maybe what Esther had in mind. Well now here we are at the end of verse six where the king is saying again. All right. What do you want? I'm inclined to grant your wish. And as we move into verse seven, there's an invisible place here where Esther has to make a decision. She's got to feel the room. She's got to feel the vibe and the mentality of her man and make a decision as to whether now is the time or not. Well, she decides now is not the time. Esther replied. My petition and my request is this. If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition, I picture Heyman may be curious, but the king in particular leaning in. Yes, if the king is found favor with you. Uh huh. And if it pleases the king to grant my petition, yes wife. Uh huh. And to fulfill my request. Okay. If the king and Heyman come tomorrow to the bank, what I will prepare for them, then I will answer the king's question. What this seems to reveal to me is that her strategy going in after three days of fasting and thinking about it and getting all gussied up was that she wanted to peak his curiosity. And maybe the king likes a good riddle, maybe in a world where he's in control of everything. The slightest little bit of teasing would have an effect on him. See their echoes here, even of the way Delilah, an undesirable character, shrewdly played on the curiosity of her very powerful man, Samson, over a bit of time. Well, whatever the case, Esther doesn't feel good. Whether she's going with the original plan of the long game or there was just something off in that moment, either way, she wishes for more wishes and invites the king and Heyman to come back next time around. Like I was saying at the beginning of this conversation, I think we've probably all been in a situation with probably with lighter stakes, but a situation where the anatomy of the decision and the anatomy of the outcome is very similar to this. And my guess is that we have all at some point pressed the abort button to postpone the big confrontation or the big nuts and bolts, brass tacks part of the conversation that needs to happen to get to resolution to wait for more favorable conditions. And I suppose the shrewdness or lack thereof of her decision to do so will play out in the coming chapters. Last thing before we wrap up here, I have a request of you and I'm hoping that I'm catching you at the right time and asking in a shrewd way. I could use some help with an editing project. I'll just tell you what I'm doing. I'm taking season two of this podcast that through the Bible one book per day. I'm reworking those episodes just a little bit so that they will function effectively as a voiceover for a series of YouTube videos. There's great stuff in that genre that already exists covering the books of the Bible already on YouTube and on the internet. I think there's room for hopefully more really good stuff in that regard with maybe a little bit of a different tone, but I need help putting stuff over the top of my voice and what I'm doing. I don't want my face to be on these videos per se. What I want to do instead is cover the raw audio of the podcast episodes I did on each book of the Bible a while back with images, text, maybe even funny and fun stuff, maybe some stock video of key locations that we're talking about, maps, details. I want to add visually a bunch of stuff that is going to help the existing podcast that I already recorded make more sense and be more useful to you and others who might be interested in that kind of thing. But like I said earlier, I need a hand. You are an artist or a video editor or you know someone who is and you're also interested in the world of the stuff that we talk about here. I would love to hear from you. If you wanted to just shoot me an email, that'd be cool. My email address is thetmbh at gmail.com. All right. Thanks for hearing me out on that. Tomorrow we'll keep moving ahead and trying to figure out whether or not Esther is playing her hand the best way she possibly could. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
