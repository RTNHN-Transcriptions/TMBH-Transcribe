I mean, that what a lame understatement. I got to try that again. My freshman year of college, I took a class called Hebrew History and Literature. And I don't even remember why I took it. I don't think I had to. It just looked fun. I guess it looked interesting and it was. It was amazing. Professor in that class, his name was Samir Masu. This dude just had his brain wrapped around everything that happened in the ancient world. And he could zip in and out of the Bible and historical documents and weave the whole story together into something cohesive in a way that was, I mean, it was so compelling that it still affects what I do with my life to this day. It was amazing to watch that. And then I think for me being raised around an exclusively devotional style of Christianity, I'm not saying that's bad, but for me, I had questions, I had history questions, I had story questions, I had narrative questions. And that was the first class where I really saw somebody do Christian faith and thought in a way that addressed those things and engaged with those things. And it was just very compelling to me. And as a result, I am such a sucker now for any place where the Bible clearly overlaps with the larger historical narrative of the world. And I mean, what are we like 13 episodes into this conversation on Esther and we're two verses in because I keep digging into the historical context that I guess I'm being redundant here. Obviously, I love that kind of an exercise. And I think there's a lot to be mined from it. A while back, you and I looked at that bit with King Josiah at the end of Second Kings, where he delays the Egyptians under Pharaoh Nikko, who were on their way to support the Assyrians and the campaign that eventually led to the Battle of Karkamesh in 605. And every time I've ever discovered one of those little nuggets, I just I get all amped up and excited. And we have one of those little nuggets here in 539 BC as we've been tracking the story of the Achaemenid Empire. That's the Persian Empire. And this great leader and founder of this empire, as we know it, Cyrus the Great. And after he defeated his grandpa, Astaiages, in an ill-advised war between the two, he eventually turns his attention to the floundering city of Babylon, where you've got a king named Nabonitis, who isn't really interested in governing at all. And it looks like you've got his son functioning as a regent king. That guy's name is Bel Shazar. And in Daniel chapter 5, which again is a prophetic book, this is not part of the historical book section of the Old Testament, but we get historical stuff in this book. I mean, actually like a third, maybe half of the book is historical stuff all set at the very end of Babylon and into the very beginning of Persia. And in Daniel, we see a floundering Babylonian empire that's being held back by its aging, narcissistic, indecisive king. That king, Nebuchadnezzar, goes through a pretty significant process with the God of Abraham, the God of the Jews, even he receives judgment from that God and even repents before that God. There's a lot happening in the context of Babylon. So like we talked about a couple of days ago, Nebuchadnezzar failed to groom quality heirs or successors to the throne. And they just didn't seem to care that much. They seemed willing to coast on the power of Babylon and that left them vulnerable to the upstart Persians under Cyrus the Great. And finally in 539, the damn burst and the very night that the kingdom of Babylon falls and the Persian Empire for my money is established. It's established on this page on this night. The events of that night from the Babylonian perspective are recorded here in Daniel. There's this meal being hosted by Bell Shazar and he's flashing all of the wealth that was stolen from the temple and from the royal treasury in Jerusalem. And then this hand appears and it starts writing literally on the wall. This is where we get to saying he saw the writing on the wall from and nobody's quite sure what it means. And then they remember that there's a wise man, maybe even in the same tradition that the wise men from the east were from that came to visit young Jesus in late Babylon and on in Di Persia. There was this class of mystics of people who had secret knowledge from the distant past and new things about things and maybe could even interpret dreams called Magi or wise men. It looks like Daniel was a part of that class. He gets called into this weird party and is like, okay, let's see what we got here with this writing or whatever. And Daniel's like, yep, sure enough, I can interpret that one. He's like, yeah, yeah, I know you're promising me a bunch of gifts and stuff. You can keep all of that. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means. Okay, the most high God. This is Daniel five verse 18. Oh king, the most high God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar's sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor. Because of the high position he gave him all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted put to death. He put to death. Those he wanted to spare. He spared those he wanted to promote. He promoted and those he wanted to humble. He humbled. But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal, he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle in his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the most high God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes. But you, his son, O bell Shazor, son, meaning descendant here, have not humbled yourself though you knew all this. Instead, you've set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from the temple brought to you and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. He goes on to talk about this pronunciation of guilt. And then Daniel says, this is what the inscription means. Literally, the writing on the wall says, menay, menay, tekel, parsen. And Daniel says it means this, menay, God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. Tekel, you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. Parsen, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and the Persians. You can maybe even kind of hear the word Persian in there. Then despite the writing on the wall, not being exactly fun, bell Shazor rewards Daniel. But then the last verses of Daniel five say that very night, bell Shazor, king of the Babylonians was slain and Darius the Mead took over the kingdom at the age of 62. I made a video about this a while back. I think that Darius, the Mead character is a general of the Medes who were working with the Persians under the authority of Cyrus. There's a general named Gobrius who Herodotus tells us about. He is a Mead and he seems to be the guy who initially conquered Babylon in October of 539. And then like a week and a half or so later, Cyrus himself shows up and then begins undertaking an approach to governance there that is in keeping with that Cyrus cylinder. That'll like football size thing that I was reading to you from a while back where the strategy is to say, Hey, I love Babylon. So glad to be here. Totally love your God. In fact, it's your God, Marduk who put me Cyrus in charge of Babylon now. So let's just keep rolling with what we're doing, except now my family will just have the dynasty and this will just be the new way the Babylon moves forward. That seems to be the tone of Cyrus's approach for how to handle the whole Babylon situation. Now, the city, according to other sources was very hard one. I mean, Babylon is a boss of a city back then. But after this victory, all we're going to see from Babylon moving forward is the occasional rebellion and upstart King claiming to be descended from Nebuchadnezzar from here on out. It really is going to be one of the four main capitals of the new Persian Empire. And our buddy Daniel was there on one of the fault lines of history, one of the most pivotal moments in the history of ever to watch the whole thing unfold. Pretty cool. We're not going to spend a ton more time on Cyrus after this, just a little bit next time around. And then we're going to get into Darius, the father of Xerxes. And then we're going to be into the book of Esther proper itself. Thanks for diving deep into this with me. I'm having a blast and I feel like we're getting to know Persia a lot better, which is great because then we're going to get to know Esther a lot better. All right, I'm Matt.
