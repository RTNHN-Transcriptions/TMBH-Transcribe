This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and right now you're in the middle of something that for some of you Is gonna be just the coolest we are having so much fun. It's nerdy. It's technical We're digging into Bible language stuff to try to make sense of a little Bible riddle We've got going on here in Galatians 4 for others of you You're going to be like literally all the other episodes of this podcast or why I like this podcast How soon will this be over? Well, the answer is I've already recorded it and it will be over after tomorrow We're doing a three little episode arc here on How you do the work to sort through a question like the one we have in front of us as to what Paul means when he uses the Greek word for element or Elemental as he tells the Galatian church and Galatians for that once we were slaves under the Elements of the world, but now we are made free in Christ. What does he mean by that? I could have just done all the work real sneaky like off microphone and just told you here Just how the things are but I don't know how the things are so instead We're doing this nerd arc together to put our heads together in real time and try to make sense of it ourselves And we're in conversation number two about that right now I'll have Jeff play some music and we'll pick up right where we left off yesterday here we go Now look as much as I'd like to imagine a you and I discovered some new controversy here and we're terribly smart and Better than everybody else the truth is this is not an original question People have wondered about this for a very long time and people who were much better Greek than I will ever be who lived much closer to this era of Greek than I will ever live and And you were probably way better at being Christians and reading the Bible than I will ever be they weighed in on this question And I've gone in preparation for this conversation. I've pulled up a few of the things of some of the ancient church fathers Said about this particular passage. Let's start with Marius Victorinas what an awesome name by the way good heavens That just sounds like somebody whose character was forged and fire Then to be the kind of person it bits like a chill name to it seems like the kind of person who could whip you in a strategy Game but then turn around and make you ice cream with a smile on his face Marius Victorinas I adore that mental note about that name Marius Victorinas writes the elements of the world were thought to have in themselves at the same time their own Motions and as it were certain necessary consequences of the motion of other beings such as stars by whose revelation Human life was brought under necessity. This guy has read the tameus isn't that interesting and so humans served the elements as the stars Or dained and the course of the world required. That's from his epistle to the Galatians So clearly this Marius fella who has a name forged and fire Looks at this passage that we're looking at in Galatians and he's like no the elemental thing It's there you're not imagining it and he's going right back to some of the same stuff that I've kind of teased out a little bit Let's keep going those see what other people think. I've also pulled up a quote from a guy named ambrosiaaster I want to go down the rabbit hole about this dude. Nobody knows who it actually is He got his name from Erasmus Erasmus is like the guy who came right before Martin Luther like the 1400s There's this commentary on the letters of Paul from the early days of Christianity that is written I guess anonymously but his ideas kind of sound like Ambrose I think and that's why Erasmus writing maybe a thousand years after this anonymous commentator on Galatians wrote I think it's why Erasmus was like he reminds me of Ambrose I'll just we'll just go with that at least I think that's a story with this fellow whatever the case Here's what he had to say by the elements Paul means new moons and the Sabbath. Oh, he's going a different direction New moons are the lunar days that the Jews observe while the Sabbath is the day of rest Therefore before the promise came that is the gift of God's grace and justified believers by purifying them We were subject like those who were infants and imperfect to our fellow servants as though to custodians our pernicious freedom Was the matrix of sin? Okay, so this is anonymous person. We call ambrosiaaster He isn't tapping in to the same elemental theory although I got to tell you where was it? I think it was in the it was in one of the lexicons There was a note in there that said some of the church fathers erroneously made this translation error with that stoichion word and they Accidentally associated it with the moon and the stars as opposed to the elements. I don't know where that is I'm not gonna go dig it up again But I think I have seen somebody Suggesting that what we just read from emprocy asked her is a mistaken use of the word here's somebody whose name We do know a little more reputable. I'm gonna read you his thought. This is Jerome Jerome is the guy who created the Latin Vulgate. He translated the Bible that just an amazing Mega genius people still depend on his work to this day. He says Paul has used the name Elements of the world for those whom he called tutors and overseers above Now remember Jerome's very very very good at this language the ultra Excellent at this language. So if he says that Paul is using the word for elements of the world Jerome is probably right so he goes on to say some hold that these are angels that preside over the four elements earth wind fire and water interesting Many think that this is the heaven and earth with their inhabitants that are called the elements of the world Because the wise Greeks the barbarians and the Romans the drags of all superstition venerate the sun the moon from which we are liberated by Christ coming Knowing them to be creatures and not divinities others interpret the elements of the world as stated by Paul as a law of Moses and the utterances of the prophets because Commencing and setting out with these letters we imbibe the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom the Mosaic law and the prophets can be taken as the elements of writing Because through them syllables and names are put together then they are learned not so much for their own sake as for the usefulness to others So it looks like Jerome has given us three different theories for how people read that turn of a phrase even in his time Then he was aware of the interpretation of like the moon and the stars being one of them And it sounds like he's not gonna give us the final answer there I've got a couple more here, but they basically are different people saying the same stuff We've already heard those are the basic opinions that I found about what to do with this little turn of a phrase They all seem to land on the same conclusion Paul's point is not obscured But there's acknowledgement that even way back in the day people put eyes on this story he onward the elements and Their brain went to slightly different places with it And I find that reassuring that we're not on a fool's errand here as we think it through for ourselves But with that said and that done let's get toward landing the plane on this for ourselves As promised at the front end of this conversation we have one more day of this nerd Bible study arc that we're doing here So for some of you you're thinking great mercifully that will be the end of that. This is heady and not what I'm into I don't like doing this stuff. I Smarted other things in my life. This just this isn't my world. I don't do this kind of thing That's okay You don't have to do this kind of thing to be good at the Bible and understand what God is saying the Bible's meant to be understood It's meant to be something you have in your hip pocket. This is the kind of rabbit trail I like to go down from time to time But as I've said already two or three times in the course of this is I'm gonna say again tomorrow The meaning of the passage I think works really well and is really clear either way I'm just curious and this format allows for that curiosity to happen in front of you And I like that and so I'm taking advantage of it right now with this little arc So we'll round all of this stuff out about what Paul means with this use of the word this turn of the phrase Elemental or elements of the world tomorrow and then we're pressing forward in Galatians chapter 4 after that All right, we'll pick up where we left off next time around I'm Matt.
