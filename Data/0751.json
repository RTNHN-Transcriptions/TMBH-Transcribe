I think it made a mess of civilization. But their plan was to earn brand loyalty from young people to new brands by driving a wedge between young people in the previous generation. And so they would promote art that wasn't the kind of thing that really pushed anybody to change or grow or think like art in previous generations and centuries had done. Instead, it just constantly fed this two part message, this two part narrative, one being your parents just totally don't understand, but we understand you. And the other being, hey, sex is no big deal. Also it's the most important thing ever. Also it's no big deal, like whatever, but it's the most important thing ever. And it's all we're going to ever talk about ever. And they just pounded this and pounded this and pounded this with music and music videos and kids programming. And after school programs, just everything was on the message. Well during that same time, Christianity is trying to figure out what it looks like to exist in the age of mass media. And that didn't go super well. The strategy that seemed to win out was, ah, we can't deny the appeal of this post-beatles era mass media stuff for young people. They love it. But also we can't go along with the messaging and some of the dirty stuff that's going on with these obviously corrupt corporations trying to ruin family relationships just to exploit a new generation for their money. So what should we do? I know they decided we're going to make a Christian sanitary family friendly analog of every dirty thing that the world comes up with. Ah, wow. I want to give that crowd the benefit of the doubt. I know they were trying. I'm not saying I could have done better. It was a strange unprecedented time, but I do feel comfortable saying I don't think that worked out very well. Some of the most laughable cringe worthy things in the history of Western art and Christian art happened in those few decades, 80s, 90s, early 2000s in an attempt to play catch up and have an answer for the things that these very corrupt corporate powers were inflicting on kids. And so it's just a weird time. And I think it doesn't form a lot of the weirdness that we feel culturally right now. I think we're still in dialogue with whatever went wrong there between those two parties. I went way longer on talking about that. Kind of got down the rabbit hole a little bit there. There's a point here for what we're talking about in Matthew 27, but I'm still not there. So there's a thing that one of those companies came up with called American gladiators late eighties early nineties. They put a bunch of Jim rats, a bunch of muscle bound model types in spandex and then they would take average people like you or me and put these poor normal people like a countenance and everything out there, put them in a unit art also and be like, Hey, run through this obstacle course while these mutated giants abuse you repeatedly and people are going to watch that and we did watch it. And I think that is what informed the Christian more family friendly response called the power team. Now I'm not going to make fun of the power team. You got to command anybody who takes the stuff that they're into and they try to do something with it that is useful and good and redemptive. I have a hundred percent sure good things came out of this, but what they did, the power team is they went around to schools and different events and they would put on displays of feats of crazy strength and it was crazy strength. They could do amazing things and then they'd have a message about the gospel or the kingdom or whatever. Look, I don't know, it was a different time. We need more time to break all of that stuff down. Here's the thing that I took four minutes plus to get here and I don't care. Where was this one stunt where they would do where they would take like a New York City phone book and they'd put it in front of some poor kid in the audience, some sophomore who's just trying to impress a girl, get a date to homecoming. They'd be like, yeah, rip this in half. And of course a kid can't, you can't rip, you can't rip a phone book in half even though it's just made a weak little papers. You still, you put that many papers together, you can't rip it. Just be reasonable, but then they'd rip it in half and not like shred the thing down the middle, but they'd work it around real hard. And when it did finally start ripping, you know, it was pretty impressive. And even if I didn't maybe gain tremendous spiritual benefit from watching the power team do their thing, it sure did make me think real hard about how difficult it is to rip thick stuff. And that's a physical conundrum that we're coming up against right here in Matthew 27 when this temple curtain tears. Again, I just want you to note the time to acknowledge what just happened. But no, Jeff, keep that. That was all very important material and it's going to stay the temple curtain tears right after Jesus says in a loud voice, whatever he cries out there at the end, and he gives up his spirit, an expression, maybe a euphemism that we talked about last time around. And then the very, very next thing that happens in Matthew 27, Jesus has just died. And then Matthew tells us verse 51 that at that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn into from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. That is a lot of stuff without explanation that is unfolding here. What does all of this mean? What's the message that all of this is supposed to convey? What are we supposed to take away from this? Well, I can tell you this much that even though there might be some debate as to what all of these things symbolize, it had a profound effect on the centurion who was there. That would be somebody who was commanding a unit of Roman soldiers like the guy back in Matthew 8 when Jesus came down off the hill from the sermon on the Mount. There's a centurion who's there and he sees all that stuff. And it says, when the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and exclaimed, surely he was the son of God. So I think to just cut right to the chase, I think the reason the temple thing is in here. The earthquake thing is in here. The darkness thing is in here. In addition to just covering the base that, hey, this happened, you original audience members, you probably heard rumors about this. Yeah, I'm confirming that that happened as the author of this book. In addition to just that historical detail confirmation stuff, I think it's here so that people would look at it like the centurion did and be like, I don't even have to get all of it. I just believe John two times at the end of his gospel effectively says the same thing. Like Jesus did a ton more stuff. There's not enough paper on earth to record everything that would need to be recorded. But the stuff that is here, the mind blowing stuff you just encountered. This is all at the end of John. It's there that you would have sufficient evidence that you would believe that Jesus is to be says he is the son of God. There's a lot of paraphrase there, but I think it's a fair paraphrase. So look, just cut into the chase, which I haven't done much of in this episode. Admittedly, the temple curtain being torn into at the most basic level is supposed to be persuasive. The question I want to work through well over the next couple of days here is why. How would that be persuasive? Is it just a feat of power like the power team where they're like, I'm going to rip a phone book in half. Now you should believe in Jesus because look at that. Look at what just happened. And I think their message was more complex. That wasn't totally fair on my part. Is it just a gesture of power that is meant to unsettle people and make them more receptive to believing in something that previously they hadn't believed in? Or is there a more complex theological message and surprise? I think there's a more complex theological message. And so do people throughout the history of Christianity, but there's some debate as to what that more complex theological message is. Some people look at this and they're like, Oh, well, it's a, it's a follow through on all of the stuff that Jesus said where he was in conflict with the religious leaders. It's, it's a further indication of judgment. We'll explore that more tomorrow. Other people look at it and they're like, well, what curtain are we talking about? And there are more than one curtain in the, the temple and the temple area. I mean, what curtain could you really see from where the crucifixion was happening? Wouldn't that be more likely to be the curtain that divides the part where the Gentiles can go from the part where only the Jews can go? So some people would look at this and say, ah, yeah, this is the, the moment where the division between Jews and Gentiles is broken down by this work of Jesus that was always meant to be for everybody. Other people are going to look at this thing and be like, ah, it looks like there's a lot more evidence in the Bible to suggest that what's happening here is that the division between God and man is, is being overcome by Jesus, this mediator, this great high priest, this go between not just to disclose my biases here. I was raised around the idea that it was that third one. And I hadn't really thought about the other two until I sat down just now and looked at this and I was like, well, I wonder if people read this one differently because it doesn't super spell it out and mark or Luke and John doesn't give us quite the same details about the curtain and all of that. So what does it mean? So we're going to unpack that a little bit, but back to the power team deal and rip in a phone book. The other thing that I think is interesting is we try to tackle this. What does the tearing of the curtain mean, which I think does have very big theological implications is just the physical question of how hard would that curtain be to tear. Now if you're picturing one of those super breezy tropical kabana curtains that you can mostly see through and that you can like walk behind when you're doing an ad for banana republic or some kind of perfume or something, then it's going to be pretty easy to rip. I mean, I'm pretty sure that Hulk Hogan intentionally picked super, super ripable fabric for those shirts he ripped off before he got in the ring. It'd be very embarrassing if you went with like a heavy triple thickness burlap and then he just yanked on it a whole bunch and grunted and veins stuck out in his forehead and finally he had just slowly take the thing off and shame. No, no, no, no. I mean, we all know. There's fabric that's going to go real, real easy. And then there is other stuff and you're like, dang, that actually would be pretty impressive if you could rip that. It's again, like if somebody said like, Oh, God, I do ripped up book in half. Okay. But like what book was it the pokey little puppy or crime and punishment? Because ripping those in half would mean different things and would get my attention to different degrees. So I am not kidding. We're doing this. I've been doing a deep dive into the question of how thick actually was this curtain and how mind blowing would it be for that thing to just rip? I actually think that detail affects what we make of this passage. And so we are going to do a little bit of history, Bible deep dive on that topic tomorrow. I don't know if all y'all are bonus episode listeners. We don't publish those very often from time to time. We do the one that I published on Saturday two days ago as I'm recording this. That's a really important episode. Episodes I don't even know the right word. It's a conversation like people because we're people and we do a thing together. And I've been putting a lot of thought and work in behind the scenes in terms of where we go next and what the plan is for the long haul. And there is going to be a long haul on this podcast and a bunch of you responded to that episode already in such positive ways. Thank you for listening to it. Thank you for the encouragement on that. Thank you for the thoughtful feedback, the suggestions, the ideas. I would be very grateful if you are a listener to this show, if you would do me the honor of going and catching that bonus episode. I think it's really important for our conversation. Thanks a ton. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
