I don't feel like I'm learning anything So you can imagine my delight when in the early days of the internet There is a series of videos where they dubbed over all of those gi-jo and knowing is half the battle Little life lesson things except they were super super offensive most of them and so don't go look these up on the internet They'll ruin your day. You won't be happy. You won't laugh at all. I don't recommend anything on the internet But what would happen in these videos is they would just I don't know what was going on They're just nonsensical ridiculous and I remember this one where there's this guy Who's like the Arctic gi-jo fighter dude? I think his name was snow job get it like you spray snow on something like with your skis I don't know and some kids are running along in there on the ice and they fall and one of them cracks their head or something And then the other kids are trying to get them off the ice and here comes snow job skiing up And he just starts yelling at the kids with this British accent and I have no idea why it was funny at all Other than he tells the kids to give the kid that's out on the ice a stick give him the stick and they start to give him the stick And then he yells don't give him the stick And then the one kid's like do you know my dad and that was it that was the whole thing again Don't look it up But from that moment forward whenever somebody seems to give conflicting instructions in my head my internal monologue Pictures snow job saying give him the stick don't give him the stick and the last couple times that I've read through the gospels It's sort of how I felt about the sword thing I haven't really put a lot of thought into it, but it seems like there's some conflicting instructions on swords from Jesus It's like it's don't take a sword do take a sword because in Matthew 10 which corresponds with I don't remember Luke 9 Something like that Jesus clearly says they don't take anything. You don't need to take money You don't need to take a sword He's go around to these different places And you're equipped with the power of the kingdom the power of God miraculous stuff is gonna happen go with the message repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand you remember all of this we talked about it in Matthew chapter 10 and You don't even need to defend yourself God's got it. You don't need to worry about that kind of thing, but then in Luke 20 It's got to be 22 turning very very quickly. I'm gonna give you an answer I think it's Luke 22 in the parallel passage to what we've been looking at in Matthew 26 It looks like Jesus right as they're leaving for the Garden of Gethsemane, right as they're leaving the Last Supper It looks like there's a detail there that Luke includes that Matthew does not whereby Jesus perhaps Countermands his orders about swords and we're talking about all of this because I think it's important because Peter's hacking around of people's ears and Jesus is saying you know my kingdom is we're not gonna do the violence thing and so which is it because if right before that Jesus said go get some swords, but another time Jesus said don't get swords give him the stick don't give him the stick That's really really confusing. Maybe it was confusing for Peter and maybe that makes it confusing for us But if we can sort through it over here in Luke Maybe it'll make it a little bit easier for us to understand the exchange we're looking at in Matthew 26 where they come to arrest Jesus and one of the unnamed disciples is swinging a sword and Chops off somebody's ear. Okay the Luke 22 verse 35 then Jesus asked them when I sent you without purse bag or sandals Did you lack anything nothing they answered he said to them But now if you have a purse take it and also bag and if you don't have a sword So your cloak and buy one it is written as he was numbered with the transgressors And I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment the disciples said see Lord here two swords That is enough he replied then they went out as usual to the Mount of Olives and his disciples followed him and The reaching that place you said to them pray that you'll not fall in temptation and then he goes and he prays and Luke's account looks a lot like Matthews the arrest is fixing to happen in the disciples They actually ask and look like should we stab somebody and then before they even get an answer One of them struck the servant of the high priest cutting off his ear. Okay, the conundrum set up What's going on here? Give him the stick don't give him the stick get a sword don't get a sword. What are we doing? Well the first Expression of all of this is pretty straightforward. She says clearly said don't take a sword with you And then all the disciples come back from their big open-world quest in Matthew chapter 10 Which is really funny because the example that we use for all of that is as dangerous to go on take this Which is an expression from the beginning of the legend of Zelda where you literally get given a sword I didn't think that through very well, but they don't have a sword in their initial trip when the sword thing initially comes up here It looks pretty overt doesn't it if you don't have a sword sell your cloak and buy one But this is where it starts to get a little bit trickier just here in Luke 22 It is written and he was numbered with the transgressors How this is tricky for me because Matthew is written to a Jewish audience and Matthew is all about pointing out every single place where Jesus is a fulfillment of Anything that happened in what we would call the Old Testament Luke is Also interested in that but doesn't spell it out at quite the same rate So I would expect that to be a point of emphasis in Matthew and not in Luke yet Here it is the way it is and I don't really have any great theories off the top of my head as to why that is the case But all on that aside, why would Jesus be bringing that up here? Because he's not a transgressor and are those guys really transgressors? Well, maybe I suppose one way to read it would be Jesus commanded them not to have swords and Then he is like yeah, go get one of those and they're like oh two of them are like oh we already we already got some Well, were they transgressing maybe against God then because he told them not to have the swords? I don't know it seems pretty obtuse it could be read that way, but I don't know That one seems like a little bit of a stretch Maybe what he means is that everybody is gonna falsely assume that he's a transgressor and we'll get into the passage that he's referencing here It's in Isaiah chapter 53 here in just a minute and Since Jesus is supposed to be among the transgressors having swords would make it look like maybe they were terrorists or rebels When they get arrested here in a minute and so it will round out that unfair Judgment or assumption or maybe the judgment is fair Maybe I mean if Peter's hacking around in years maybe he really is a transgressor and the right way to think of him is some kind of violent rebel and so the very fact that Peter and I guess we're gonna assume Simon the zealot would be the other one I was talking with somebody with Jeff the other day about this and I think that was the guess we came away with like Simon The zealot he's always on the lookout for the government He probably would have had a sword underneath his cloak somewhere. It just makes sense So maybe in order for the prophecy to be fulfilled properly they had to behave the way they were gonna behave and Two swords is more than enough one of you two guys is gonna act out and when you do act out Okay, well that'll be enough to fully justify my arrest and now that'll give everybody all the mental ammunition They need for me to end up where it is that I need to end up for the grand redemptive plan It could be other people very credible people have suggested that Jesus is in Invoking some kind of sarcasm here. I'm a very big fan of sarcasm. I think it's a good idea I think it's an overly criticized underused figure of speech in Christian circles and Yet at the same time I'd have to admit that usually the sarcasm comes through a little more clearly in the Bible if this is the case Man that is really dense sarcasm And it almost feels weird to write that down in something that you're gonna hand on to future generations because people are gonna miss that Indeed like if that is sarcasm Most people who read it are missing it still other very very smart people have Suggested that what's happening here is Jesus says this thing like hey He's just saying like we're moving into the next phase of the three phases I talked about back in Matthew chapter 10 Then you get this initial open world quest then we got what happens with the rest of your lives And we got how things are gonna play out when people talk about the kingdom on into the future Maybe he's saying like we're moving into phase two where this is gonna get a lot more difficult for you You're gonna have to fend for yourself and handle your own business financially maybe even defend yourself I mean maybe he's saying that and As he throws that out the couple of the disciples are like yeah We got swords already like we were already ready to do that and Jesus is just sick of the conversation He's like no, you're not understanding me or maybe Jesus some would suggest meant something totally different than what I just threw out But the it is enough or that is enough comment that he makes at the end is kind of a hand wave dismissal to just say We don't need to straighten this out right now You don't get it and the conversation is lingered on long enough. They're bigger things going on right now Let's go deal with those bigger things What doesn't make sense to me as a read on this passage is either a universal prohibition on self-defense with a weapon or a universal endorsement of self-defense with a weapon for the gun control debate crowd people are really interested in that I Just think you're gonna have to look at other parts of the Bible to decide what you're gonna do with that one Because if he did mean Two swords say do we have him? Okay, that should be enough enough for what to defeat Rome Enough for what to fend off his arrest? Well, he didn't even try to fend off his arrest So at least in this circumstance, it doesn't look like he had any interest in these swords being used to defend him Remember he's going willingly to the cross so Might Jesus have strong opinions about self-defense and what weapons are on the okay list and what weapons should be on the band list for self-defense? I mean, I'm sure Jesus knows exactly where that line is and how things ought to be But I don't think it's expressly spoken to here and so often this is a passage that gets co-opted one way or another to try to address that issue at the most basic level it looks like Jesus is indicating that we're turning a page here in terms of Circumstances from the way things were to a new way things are supposed to be and also somehow This is a fulfillment of prophecy is that just for a moment is that forever? I don't think that's as abundantly clear and certainly we cannot read Luke 22 Matthew 26 John 18 Jesus arrest in the garden We can't read any of that as being some sort of wholesale endorsement of violence or Jesus being like yeah We need to kill a lot of people to make this kingdom thing happen So let's get started right here in the garden He just seems to be saying the exact opposite. We'll talk more about that kind of stuff tomorrow So yes on the surface this does seem if you just snip out a couple of verses here Like a little bit of a give him the stick don't give him the stick kind of situation in the Bible But given that Jesus is talking about being the fulfillment of what we said in Isaiah 53 12 something We'll get to in a future conversation and given that we are on this pivot moment between One era of his time in ministry and with his disciples and into another era of the disciples and the church I would say that that contradiction is maybe not as grand as it is sometimes made out to be But we'll have more time to sort that through in coming days. Don't go check out those GI Joe videos I'm telling you they're offensive and you're not gonna like them and you're not gonna laugh And I'm sorry I had to bring them up But I just wanted to try to make the Bible make sense and I couldn't think of any other way I'm Matt.
