And right now, we're going to rest her. I had a professor in college. I studied political science. I was one of the things that I went and got a degree in when I was a kid. And we had a professor named Gwen. Gwen was great. She was a lawyer. I think she's still a lawyer. And she was different than all the other professors at my liberal arts college. She jabbed the bear a lot and she was very comfortable in her own skin and with her own knowledge and understanding of the world. And she knew she couldn't just do her to force, make a bunch of 18, 19 and 20 year olds think the right things. So the classes were very so kratik. And there's tons of debate and back and forth. And a lot of the debates were very sophomoric and super basic things that kids just haven't thought through yet. I just hadn't thought through those things. But I wanted to do these poli-sai classes with Gwen because I was a thinker. I was a politically motivated young man who saw the way the world ought to be. And I knew which team was right and which team was wrong from the devil. And I was going to go and argue for that stuff and crush the opposition. It was very much a political team player all in on my team. Like the same way I would root for the Denver Broncos. I rooted for my political team. I didn't care about stupid stuff like the rule of law and a bunch of dumb idiotic procedural things that get in the way of doing what needs to be done. Gwen in our classes constantly argued that there is a deteriorating phenomenon that occurs when one party gets a little bit of power and then violates a whole bunch of norms and rules and due processes of law even tries to jump the boundaries of separation of power within a government because eventually the shoes on the other foot. Now the other team is in charge and everything that team A did to violate political norms and rules and laws when they were in charge. Team B will feel free to do plus a little bit more which then makes team A even angrier when they get back in charge and they're going to violate things even more to punish that wrongdoing. And eventually there is no rule of law and things deteriorate into third world tin pot dictator political nonsense prosecute your political opponents just usual run of the mill bull crap like you see throughout the political history of everything. At the time I remember thinking oh Gwen you're so naive and simplistic so dedicated to these archaic ideas about the rule of law you don't understand the times we live in and how urgent it is certain things be done. We don't have time for warrants. We know who the bad guys are we just got to go get them. I thought thoughts like that and she was very patient she humored me a lot and just kept pointing back to this thing about how no whatever violations party A does party B will not only imitate but will increase. I was again probably 18 or 19 years old when all that was going down and eventually I turned into an adult because of the passage of time and I assumed some things with my glands or whatever and when I became an adult I started to look at how the things are in the world and was like oh you know who had a point Gwen Gwen had a point because over the course of my lifetime all I've seen is this cycle back and forth it's like you've got a bed of loose soil that is barely holding together and that is the stability on which society stands and then you got this pendulum acts that swings back and forth and it's like the rule of law keeps that from striking into its own foundation and cutting into that soil but every time party A is in charge or party B is in charge and some things are just too important this isn't the time for a warrant or the rule of law and they violate the rule of law they violate in our country the Constitution it's like they just lower that swinging expenulum down a little bit of that dirt and it scrapes off the top layer but it's still mostly there the foundation is pretty strong but then the other team does it a little more now it digs a little deeper than the other teams in charge now they do it more because these are very dangerous times it's time for the Constitution or civil liberties or human rights the things are very very dangerous there's an economic military medical crisis we just got to do things to people right now and with each one of these violations the pendulum with that swinging acts cuts deeper and deeper into the foundation on which it rests and eventually societies fail well I think we're seeing one of those shoe is on the other foot kind of situations in Esther chapter eight and did I talk about that whole setup too long oh heck yeah I did also I'm feeling things today so this is just what you get this stuff happens in real time I think it's part of the fun of how we do this you get wherever I'm at on a given day and well that's where I'm at thinking about stuff like that and then of course when you're thinking about stuff like that stuff on the page just pops because what really is the anatomy of what just happened here in Xerxes court over the past few months as we get into Esther chapter eight this guy had personal problems and gigantic crises and he wasn't attentive to the rule of law he gave his signet ring to somebody else and they just started writing vile legislation in the name of the king so all of the power of the king was in play and used by Haman but none of the integrity that theoretically comes with that office remember this is an absolute monarchy there's no one else to check the bad impulses of government it's the king and maybe his wife if she's noble in some way would speak into his ear and help him resist those darker impulses this kind of absolute monarchy is so dependent its success is so dependent on the competency and the character of the king there is no separation of powers everything comes to that point at the tippy top of the hierarchy and Xerxes is portrayed in the book of Esther as completely failing in those duties he is not demonstrating character or conviction he is not keeping tabs on the integrity of the system of government and his empire and he completely abdicates that responsibility lazily and flippantly in Esther chapter three when Haman comes to him with his plan he doesn't even bother to ask who the people group is that Haman intends to kill he's just like yeah here's my ring whatever just yeah write your bloodthirsty edict i got some things to do and he walks out and that's it all of this could have been avoided if Xerxes who wanted to be in the role of the guy where the buck stops if he had done what he's supposed to do and even been attentive even low character and attentive would have got it done here then all of this would have been avoided but he didn't so the one side the Haman side says there is such an emergency right now it's such a crisis there's a people in our kingdom who should not be tolerated that's the language that he uses remember we asked nicely for them to behave well and they didn't our tolerance is running out modern day tin pot dictators even in my part of the world in the last few years have said phrases like that and so the tolerance is over and we got to do this things or excuse me like great go ahead and do the thing so he just gives him the ring and Haman does whatever he's going to do that is a swing of the pendulum of the trustworthiness of government and the rule of law into the foundation on which it stands the pendulum got lowered and it took a huge chunk right there out of the credibility of the rule of law in Xerxes court in Xerxes kingdom and now that foundation is a lot more wobbly because the axe got lowered and took a chunk out of the foundation of it well what's going to happen my college polycyed professor Gwen she knows the answer to this but let's just run the rhetorical question anyway what happens when side a team Haman violates the norms of law and does something like this and then team B Mordecai Esther and those who care about the fate of the Jews what are they going to do when now they're in charge when they have the gavel when they have two of the three branches of government when they have the power of the all-powerful extra legislative executive order that just kind of happens as a dare to ask anybody to stop them what are they going to do is team B in response to the actions of team A now that they have the ring of power well tell you what they're going to do the exact same thing and maybe more and so Xerxes negotiates against himself as we talked about last time well all right you asked for all that stuff and well because Haman attacked the Jews I've given his estate to Esther and now hanged him on the gallows so there we are oh boy you don't look happy with that it looks like you're waiting for me to say more things than I'm gonna do well I will not be made a fool of I had some other things than I was gonna say and going on just catching my breath there for a minute also now write another decree in the king's name on behalf of the Jews it seems best to you Mordecai and seal it with the king's signet ring for no document written in the king's name and sealed with his ring can be revoked and then it looks like he just basically leaves and now human nature tells us that there's no chance that Mordecai is going to be like whoa whoa whoa Xerxes here's the thing man the rule of law and the relationship between the people and the government and the government's credibility is kind of like a pendulum suspended over a stable but fragile foundation of packed dirt and hanging from that pendulum is an axe swinging back and forth just above the foundation on which it stands but every time we violate the rule of law it's like we lower that pendulum and allow it to cut into carve into the foundation on which the whole thing is predicated I'm sorry good king while Esther and I appreciate the gesture we simply cannot risk this violation to the stability and future prospects of good governance for the people of Persia here's the ring back I just can't write that edict even though I'd love to save my people the rule of law is just too important and hopefully with this gesture our political opponents who want to see us completely eradicated will match pace and no longer violate legal norms to seek our destruction now of course he's not going to do that he's going to match whatever the last guy did and that's exactly what he does so as is it once verse nine of Esther eight the royal secretaries were summoned on the 23rd day of the third month the month of sivan they wrote out all of these orders we'll talk about what those orders are next time around but look that brings us to our little land the plain moment here a little life lesson because we're so into that here we do so many life lessons what should Mordecai have done should he have tried to stick up for the constitution I say that in quotes of the a key minute empire to make sure that no further decline occurred here or should he use the same systems that were so fragile and corruptible for his own to save his people at least here I guess I'm on team Mordecai generally speaking I'm with professor Gwen on the idea that you don't want to violate legal norms but here the violation isn't trifling the violation if it's not addressed is going to be the end of the Jewish people then so I guess if the mechanism you were offered to fix it and amend the problem is the exact same mechanism that made the problem in the first place I suppose you use it but I would also say this if you're in a desperate situation and you have to use that same legally shady mechanism that was used to put you in a bad spot in the first place to get out of the bad spot you haven't really done anything to future proof this kind of situation from occurring again and indeed it's only going to be a matter of a few years later and we're going to see similar shady uses of the quote unquote legal system to do all the proper paperwork to punish and persecute the Jews during the reign of Xerxes successor art as Xerxes so this looks like a way that is fixing to solve an immediate crisis but it doesn't look like this is a way to create a long-term solution within the parameters at least of the Persian Empire to the problem and I'm happy to announce we're going to get a much closer look at exactly how that plays out in the reign of Xerxes son and successor art as Xerxes when we go and look at the book of Nehemiah in our next series yep that's going to be season four of this podcast we're steeped in Persian stuff already I mean right now me and probably every single one of you is more fresh more clear more precise on the details of the Persian age of the Old Testament than we've ever been at any other moment in our entire lives and there's a whole bunch of story left to play out after the situation that we're dealing with in Esther finishes up and that happens in the book of Nehemiah and a little bit more in the book of Ezra which we'll dip into as we work through Nehemiah as well also there are three minor prophets who were speaking during this time and we're going to get a closer look as we work through Nehemiah next as to what they were saying and how somehow in the midst of these chaotic stories like Esther and what we see in Ezra and Nehemiah points back to the New Testament which is where we'll go in the season after that and the person and life and death and resurrection and reign of Christ as well so I'm super excited about that next thing of course I'm printing up books and I got some other ideas for things we're going to do for patrons and I'll get into all of that stuff later on this has been another long one that's two in one week I'll get it back under control I promise we're going to try to stick with the 10-ish minute Bible hour thing that's that I mean those are the ground rules we're going to try to do it I want this to fit into your commute all right I'm at this attempt in a Bible hour podcast Nehemiah next so exciting let's do this again soon you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 12.96, "text": " You're listening to
