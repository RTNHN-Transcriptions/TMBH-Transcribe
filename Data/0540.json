It looks like they're about to pull the old bait and switch on you. I was like, Yeah, I was thinking that too, dad. What the heck? Also what's the bait and switch? I know I just want you to say it so that I can hear how you would say it. I didn't know. And dad explained that the bait and switch was the thing where you say one thing is going to happen, but then surprise once you get inside and you're kind of locked into the deal and a little bit obligated and on the hook. Now it was this completely other thing. And now you got tricked. And because of some basic aspects of our shared human psychology and sunk cost fallacy, then you can't get out of it and now you feel obligated and you don't want to be embarrassed or admit that you were wrong or that you got tricked. And so the bait and switch is a really effective tactic because it weaponizes our own dignity and pride and also decency against ourselves to get us to go along with things that we never would have gone along with if they just set up front. Here is the horrible thing I'm inviting you to go along with. Likewise in Matthew chapter 23, Jesus is pretty much saying that the Pharisees and the teachers in the law are exceptionally gifted at the bait and switch with imagery about clean cops that look good on the outside, but on the inside they're rancid and full of junk. You'd never want to ingest and another image about a whitewashed tomb that looks so pretty inside. But did you catch the part about it's a tomb? There's also some dead rotting person in there with these two images. He's accusing them of being like one of those giant tooth angler fish from finding Nemo that dangles out the little thing and like, that's a pretty light. I'd like to be around that, but then there are gaping jaws of death right behind it. But now you already got suckered in. What Jesus is saying in Matthew 23 verses 25 through 28 is happening in front of the whole room. Everybody in the temple area is hearing what he's teaching. And in the same way that in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus is teaching his disciples. It literally says that right at the beginning of Matthew chapter five. But the teaching is also very cognizant of the fact that the religious leaders, the Pharisees are right there hearing what's being said. So here when we get deep into this text, it feels like, oh man, this is all directed at the Pharisees. But really, this is still for the benefit of the crowds and the disciples. The denouncement is pointed at the religious leaders. But verse one of chapter 23 says, then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples. So the conversation with the religious leaders is over. This is directed at them. But if we bear in mind that this was meant to be consumed and internalized and processed by the audience at hand, then when Jesus says the kind of stuff he's saying here, what he's really saying is you guys got tricked. You guys got duped. You got trapped. You got suckered. And hopefully if the crowds and the disciples are listening, they're hearing like no shame that that can happen. But you need to pull away from this mess now because now your eyes are open. You're seeing what's inside the cup. You're seeing what's inside the tomb. Good heavens don't double down on it and defend your previous choices, which is the second mistake and fatal mistake that the person who's the victim of the bait and switch makes. Like, okay, you got baited. It happens to the best of us. Well, not to Jesus, but everybody else. It happens to the best of us. Just don't go for the switch. Walk away when the switch happens. And so if this is truly directed at the larger audience, and it looks like the text is saying that it is, then the take home lesson of this is my friends, the curtain has been pulled back. Look at what this actually is. Just walk away. And then report to reference all the way back to the very first message Jesus ever taught anybody, repent, turn in the other direction for the kingdom of heaven is near us. Just to make sure we're all up to speed. I'm actually talking about, let me read the text because I mean, it's 10 minute Bible hour. I'm supposed to read the Bible because it's like super important. And sometimes I get going. I forget that and read at the beginning goes like this. What do you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites, you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they're full of greed and self indulgence, blind Pharisee. Just clean the inside of the cup and dish. And then the outside will also be clean. What do you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites, you're like whitewashed tombs, which are beautiful on the outside, but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way on the outside, you appear to people as righteous, but on the inside, you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. We already talked about one place where I think this is a payoff on earlier stuff, Jesus said, and that is the business about repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. You got fooled, you got tricked, you got baited. That happens. Repent, turn in the other direction while you still can. There are only gaping jaws of fangs and death. If you keep going down this sunk cost fallacy road that you are headed down right now, and that message of repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand is clarified in chapter 16 when the Pharisees and Sadducees come and ask like jerks demanding the sign from heaven. And Jesus is like, no, we're not going to do that. You know how to interpret the signs and deontones their wicked and adulterous and that they'll only get the sign of Jonah and then he tells the disciples, be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. So we're getting more clarity on what it actually is that most people in Jesus audience, the disciples and the crowds. Remember, that's who he's talking to here in Matthew 23. This is what they need to repent of. This is what they need to turn away from. Okay. So once again, payoffs here and repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. That's there. Pharisees and the Sadducees are demonstrative of most of the things that you probably need to actually repent of. A third theme that pays off here is the hypocrisy versus purity of heart theme. Jesus pounds that in the Sermon on the Mount, talking about what it is to do the right thing externally to seek approval from men, whether it be spiritual disciplines with how you pray or donate or fast, or whether it be on issues of obedience, like not killing people or not committing adultery. On all of those things, the heart of the Sermon on the Mount has Jesus distilling it down, being like true obedience. True righteousness means that you embrace the values of the kingdom. And what happens on the outside of you is reflective of the good things, the kingdom-value things that are happening on the inside of you. And he makes it pretty clear, knowing again that the Pharisees are in the audience there in the Sermon on the Mount, that your religious leaders are not the ones who are getting it right as he calls out how they pray and the other hypocritical things that they do. Also in the Sermon on the Mount, this is another payoff that we're seeing here in these two twin woes about hypocrisy in the false outside versus that dirty actual inside. Another one of these payoffs is with the planks versus specks in Matthew 7 at the end of the Sermon on the Mount. The whole thing about worrying about stupid little things that are in somebody else's eye when you got these gigantic things in your own eye. It seems like that language from earlier in chapter 23 about straining out a gnat, but you guzzled a whole camel. That's pretty indicative of that missing the pointiness that is introduced in the planks versus specks passage in Matthew 7. And then just in general, I think we're seeing a payoff on the notion of a failed righteousness that is from the Pharisees. Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5, Sermon on the Mount, your righteousness would have to exceed the Pharisees if you wanted to get into the kingdom. Ultimately, what we find out is that it would have to exceed it by so much that only a righteousness from God imparted to people by the miraculous gracious work of God could get that done. But even if we read it in a more literal human sense, we would still have to take it as Jesus saying, these guys aren't even close. What they're doing, it isn't even on the track of righteousness. It's hypocrisy. So obviously it would have to exceed that. Now pretty simply put, we can read Matthew chapter 23 and forget that this is all spoken to the crowds and the disciples, people who've been tricked and people who are now on the threshold, they're on the verge of being destroyed because they got tricked and they got the little spirals in their eyes and they can't walk away from it. They got Stockholm syndrome. They're so used to these abusers abusing them that scary to imagine doing things in some other way and so they keep marching toward this inevitable destruction and implicit in this whole Matthew 23 is guys, your eyes are being opened. Listen to what I'm saying. These are blind guides. They are fooling you. They are tricking you. They are hurting you. They are driving a wedge between you and God by continuing down this path. Each step you take toward this weird version of religion is one step further away from what you say you're actually trying to achieve, which is closeness with your maker. No, the quickest way to get to where you want to be is to turn around and walk back in the exact opposite direction. And so, yeah, this is a condemnation of the Pharisees and the religious leaders, but also this is a warning and an exhortation to the original audience and at the risk of violating the it's the Bible without the sermon tagline promise that I have made to you. It feels like this kind of resonates across the ages, doesn't it? It feels like there's something here for us too. I mean, maybe it makes sense for us to be gracious to each other in this moment in history and acknowledge that the people were angry as that are usually just people who got tricked in a different way than we got tricked. They got tricked into being mad at a different group of people than we got tricked into being mad about. They got tricked into a different kind of pride than we got tricked into. I think this passage is supposed to build some empathy for other people who got fooled, who got baited into something that is destructive. And I think there should be some degree of collegiality we come away with here where we're all like, dang, this really is a poisonous trap that looks good on the outside, but there's only death on the inside. We're all kind of victims of this thing, maybe a little bit even perpetrators of it. We should get out of here together and we should encourage each other while we do so. Yeah. So narratively, thematically, I think it's important for us to pay off some of those themes like we did earlier in our conversation here. But I think this particular passage does speak into our lives and the equations you and I have to run for ourselves right now as well. So easy to look at other people's lives and be like, you got fooled. You should stop walking into that trap right now. But weirdly, we just cannot see that as clearly when it's happening to us. Strange how that is. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
