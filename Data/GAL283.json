podcast we're in season five of this podcast which is on the book of Galatians and some of you probably thought well this is gotta be about done several weeks ago because we finished the book of Galatians but then you found out no we're not done because this podcast follows one the Bible and to my curiosity and we got to the end of Galatians and I started thinking well I still have curiosity then my curiosity was to track down a question I've never tracked down before which is how did it work out for the people who got this letter how did the whole Christianity thing play out there after the Bible was over and so you and I for the last couple weeks something like that have been tracking down Bible clues for whether or not the message of Paul in the book of Galatians worked it stick with the original audience did Paul's argumentation win the day or did the Judaizers come back in and circumcise everybody big bloody circumcision fast right there in church and then the wheels fell off and totally went to garbage well it looks like it was the prior according to the Bible Paul's argument won Paul went out on the second missionary journey to circulate the decisions of the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 they all seem to like Paul very much they all seem to agree with him very much so it's been very fun doing the actual leg work together here in the Bible over the last week or two tracking down these clues to determine that yeah it looks like Galatians one Paul won the day with the letter Paul won the argument clue number one was that the Jerusalem Council affirmed the letter to the Galatians yes I wrote these down I've got them in front of me in my little notebook clue number two that we came across is from the second missionary journey when we found out that Timothy job opening is from Lystra Lystra is almost surely one of the churches in view with the letter of Galatians of the fact that Timothy was still there and there's a thriving community of faith means that they got it right Paul wouldn't have taken somebody who had been swayed by the circumcision arguments that the Judaizers were making with him but he did take Timothy with him our clue number three comes right after that in Acts 6 5 where it's or 6 5 what am I doing Whitman come on read the thing it's didn't plain English by your own hand acts 16 5 where it says so the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers in the context there is the Galatian churches that indicates the Galatian stock and the clue number four is a deduction that we made from the second missionary journey about where things seem to work on that journey and which stops were relatively unproductive and the only time that we know that Paul was in the neighborhood of the place where some people theorize Galatians was written to that being North Galatia not much happened that leg of the trip wasn't very productive but the southern leg of the trip was very productive and the southern leg of the trip the first part of the trip was in South Galatia where these churches are so clue number four there is kind of a negative argument and a positive argument positively the southern Galatian churches were thriving when Paul went back through negatively nothing of note happened apparently in what we could call North Galatia and I think if the fire were still burning and the letter was written to North Galatia and everybody up there was like no we reject your dumb letter of Galatians we'd have a lot more fireworks in Acts 16 there in the second missionary journey with Paul going up there to duke it out and make sure he won those arguments clue number five is that the same message of the book of Galatians worked pretty much everywhere else everywhere that Paul went and engaged with this he might not have convinced everybody he might not have convinced all of his old classmates but what we do see happen is a whole bunch of churches get established and they all get established by embracing the gospel that is articulated in Galatians so there's our five biblical clues that we've been working on but now our quest takes a slightly different turn now it's time to go beyond the timeline of the Bible and consider what we find in these towns that I think Galatians was written to but we'll also go even consider the towns that I don't think Galatians were written to up North that we know a couple of towns up there that were prominent heck why not we can go dig around to get the internet for that we'll go see if we can find anything up there so over the next few days we got to do a deep dive into Derby, Lystra, Iconium and Passidian Antioch those are the four churches that are either in Galatia or right on the fringes of being in Galatia that we know Paul went to again and again and again and then like I said we'll go and explore a couple others that don't really come up in the Bible but if Paul were writing Galatians to somewhere else I guess it would have been those two towns those would be the best candidates so we'll go see what was happening there but before we go any further here let's just do a little Bible trivia or Bible intuition here and I know that some of you have been around the Bible forever and some of you are pretty new to this I actually think this will be trickier for the people who have been around the Bible forever but here we go what do you picture as being the churches Paul most visited or the towns Paul most visited on all of his journeys throughout the book of Acts where does your head go for me without if I didn't think about it at all the ones that would pop would be Corinth and Ephesus and you know obviously there's the sending community of Antioch where they were first called Christians but I don't count that that's like the launching spot it's not part of the journey he goes to Jerusalem a lot but that's not really part of the missionary journeys he's kind of checking back in with the home office when he goes there setting those two aside it's Corinth and Ephesus right we know from the New Testament that he was there a lot those two towns are the two places he kind of set up shop and did work I mean he was in a lot of these places for a decent chunk of time compared to how quickly you and I travel now when we go on like vacation or something or a short-term mission trip but in Corinth and Ephesus I mean he was there for you know years combined between the two but I'm just asking you which towns did he visit the most even if it was just there very briefly well my math says it was actually the towns that we're talking about here in Galatia Derby Lystra Iconium and Piscidian Antioch those four towns are listed very explicitly in the first missionary journey and if you go and pull up a missionary journey map they don't draw it right because if they were really gonna draw it they should just draw squiggly lines between these four cities a whole bunch because Paul bounced back and forth among them a lot and it's kind of hard to even nail down how many times he dipped in and out between these four cities because sometimes they like them and hailed him as a god incarnate other times they hit him with rocks a lot Derby seems to have accepted the message pretty quickly they might have been the most receptive town of all the towns of all of his journeys ever if you really think about it was pretty wild because that's pretty early on in the game that Paul went to Derby but if we only count those each as one visit which I don't think is fair I think it's actually more than one visit you can show it from the text and then we also add that to his second missionary journey where we know for sure he went to Derby, Maestro, Iconium, and Pecidian Antioch then already through the first two missionary journeys these towns are they're going to be at the top of the list of total number of visits and then finally starting in Acts chapter 18 where we get the somewhat accelerated account of Paul's third missionary journey it opens with him maybe quickly maybe it took a long time but he definitely went through this area again Derby, Maestro, Iconium, Pecidian Antioch maybe the fact that we don't get a lot of details there and maybe the fact that he doesn't seem to stay for really all that long comparatively says that stuff was good Paul was not a guy who liked to sit and be comfortable maybe this is clue number six actually in a way Paul wasn't a guy who'd be like god things are great here I'll just sit tight and relax I don't really like trying hard or doing things or pounding pavement I only sort of believe in Jesus and don't feel that much compulsion to go tell everybody about him no Paul was always on the move he was a mover and shaker he would figure out how to keep going and doing what needs to be done he set up shop at times to strengthen the church he'd figured out the Corinth and Ephesus were good landing spots where he could regionally affect a whole bunch of things now that he had helpers and stuff who he could dispatch from there with letters but Paul was always on the move so on the beginning of the third missionary journey flies through these towns comparatively my assumption would be because stuff was going great on that third missionary journey Paul almost surely went west out of Pissity and Antioch which is pretty much dead center the part of modern day turkey that we've been talking about this whole time and he would have gone west from there toward Ephesus he would have passed right by Colossae I don't think he ever actually went to Colossae more in that in the next season on Philemon at Ephesus things got a little bit crazy kind of started to bog down and the rest of this journey is fraught with all sorts of adventures and peril before Paul finally makes his way back toward home and then he gets arrested and Paul's story rounds out with a couple of very long arrests a journey to Rome as a prisoner maybe he gets released for a while and does one more journey we'll explore that more when we get into Colossians all of that to say Ephesus and Corinth they're real sexy they sound cool those are the places that you think of they got books of the Bible named after them but really part of the reason that we think of those two churches so much is because so much ugly stuff happened there Corinth was a disaster it's not that he visited there the most it's that things always seemed to be going wrong in Corinth and he did go there a lot too so they got two books of the Bible and then more that didn't even make it into the Bible whereas maybe the fact that we only get one letter and it's a lump letter to Lystra, Iconium, Derby and Pecidian Antioch means that they listened better and got it better well well whatever the case which is a wonderful reset phrase that I have discovered I use a lot lately hmm whatever the case whatever the case these four towns were clearly near and dear to Paul's heart he showed up there a lot it seems like things went okay as far as we can track it in the Bible even though we hear more about Ephesus and Corinth, Philippi, even Thessalonica later on so if these churches were that big a deal you would think there would be something left there ought to be something we can dig up there should be a rock or a engraving or something that points to the church thriving there in the immediate aftermath of the Bible and I've done some metaphorical digging around about the literal digging around other people have done and I'm pleased to announce that I have things to report all right tomorrow we're going to go to Derby and find out what the heck happened there as we continue on our quest to figure out whether the book of Galatians worked all right that's good for now I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast let's do this again soon you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "
