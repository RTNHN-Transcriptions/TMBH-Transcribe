It's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we spend three days talking about Caiaphas, the high priest, the son of Anas, bummer name for that guy who was the former high priest or son in law of Anas, I guess as it were. And I think after three days, it's a little easier to understand the pressures that Caiaphas was feeling historically, politically, socially, spiritually. But that brings us to a place where now we're back to the narrative here in Matthew 26. And things are coming to a head between the religious leadership and Jesus. And they're really in a much more difficult spot than it seems like. Every time that I've read through the book of Matthew up until this time, I have felt like the religious leadership were in the power position. And Jesus was in the weakness position. I mean, not in the grand scheme of things. The Bible holds him out as being God in the flesh. And we've seen him break the laws of time and space. Obviously Jesus is in the power position. But I just mean, you know, looking at it from a political point of view, from a narrative point of view, I just always felt like, Oh, Jesus, there's nothing he can do. He's headed to the cross. It's just, it's just inevitable. It has to happen for the grand unfolding of things. And the ones who really have their hands on the wheel here, it's the religious leaders. But this time through, I'm like, dang, now that ain't even close. Jesus is in the power position here. And if you wanted to exploit his position, he could just win. But he doesn't. He's headed to the cross on purpose. The religious leaders are the ones who were totally on their heels and desperate. It's like when a team goes up three zero and a best of seven sports playoff series. And then the opposing team takes one game and now it's three one. And all of a sudden, if you're rooting for the team that's up three Oh, you got a real nervous, uneasy feeling and to outsiders, it might look like you're in charge. But the insiders, especially if you get a team with a history of choking and screwing everything up, you start getting real, real nervous. And I think that's probably what Kiyefis fans were doing at this point. And especially Kiyefis and his pals himself. And I think that's evident in just these couple of verses we've been looking at here. Here we go. Matthew 26, three, then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace, he gets a palace dang of the high priest, whose name was Kiyefis. And they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him. But not during the feast, they said, or there may be a riot among the people. What we've seen here is that Jesus has a surprising amount of support in Jerusalem. Now, on paper, you would figure he would not, right? He hasn't been there very much. I mean, we know he made more trips to Jerusalem than Matthew records from the other gospels, particularly John. But it seems like all of Jesus support is up north. He's got a pretty good reputation up there. I mean, at the most, what we've seen from people is indifference. I mean, really, not a lot of overt hostility and Nazareth. They were like, yeah, I don't know. Not that impressed carpenter's son, some Gentiles. They didn't like what he did with the pigs, the cast and the demons in the pigs. And they went off the cliff and they're like, yeah, just leave. And so he left. I don't know. I got, I don't got much more negativity than that. You have the Pharisees who are mad. The Romans, they don't seem to mind him. Jesus did a solid for one of their higher ups. So he's got solid support up north. And at some time, a while back, I ran the numbers on this. I was like, yeah, how many, how many people would have seen all the stuff that Jesus did? What percentage? And I don't remember it. I don't have it in front of me. But I was pretty staggered by how likely it was pretty much everybody had some kind of encounter with Jesus. And even if they didn't know what to make of him, they would have been one connection, one relationship away, one degree of separation away from somebody they could talk to and be like, did it? Did that guy's hand actually grow back at a nothing? Huh? And you were there and you saw it? Huh? Okay. Did he actually feed thousands of people with one lunchbox? And you were there and you saw it and you watched the whole time. There's no, like you could see his hands. Huh? Yeah. Okay. I, I don't know what to make of it myself, but I trust you and you were there and you saw it. So all right. And when you've got that kind of grassroots support ranging to grassroots, friendly and difference, that's pretty good. And you're going to be on solid footing up north. And that's why the story takes such a dark turn, such a like, wow, what are you doing? Jesus kind of turn when he turns and starts walking towards Jerusalem. It's like you don't really have to do that. You could just stay up here forever. And things are going to work out pretty well. I mean, Luke marks that as like the turning point of the whole gospel. I don't remember exactly what the verse is. I used to know that off the top of my head, but it's something like then Jesus turned and said his face resolutely toward Jerusalem. Dang. I'm I hate that I don't remember that. That's that used to be like my Matthew 5 17 thing. Like this is the pivot point, but I don't know. It's, it's in there. I promise that actually happened and is a really important thing. Yes. I'm, I'm blatantly fumbling around to try to find and see if I can save face. And the answer is no, I can't, but that's in there somewhere in that definitely, definitely happened. So Jesus abandons his support base, which makes it seem like he's in a position of weakness and goes to the headquarters, the place where all of his opposition is concentrated and bolstered by military presence. None of the military Roman leaders in Jerusalem had received any favors from Jesus. They wouldn't have been sympathetic to him the way the centurion way up north would have been. So Jesus goes there and on paper, this should be a disaster, but you know, we talked about the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread that comes right after it. And that means it's a tiny year when country goes to town, everybody gets gussied up and goes to Jerusalem and they do their religious activities and they have their meals there and they reconnect with family. And that means a lot of Jesus support base was traveling with him at the time, maybe not like literally in his party, but they were making the same migration as Jerusalem was swelling for these events. And I'm sure that every year, this was an uncomfortable time for the religious leadership because they held sway over the urban elites, but the more practically minded outsiders, they're always going to be interested in seeing the town folk get taken down a peg. They're always going to be a little suspicious of that central authority. And now add to that, the most credible messianic claimant that anybody could remember ever having come down the pike. And that adds up to pressure on them. Jesus receives a super warm reception on his way into town in chapter 21. The little children are all calling in the son of David when the religious leaders ultimately confront him and get mad about all that. He deftly maneuvers around their stupid questions. He calls them out for things that the country come to town crowd as well as the people who are just playing along, even though they live in Jerusalem. All of those parties heard what Jesus said in Matthew 23 when he pronounced those seven woes against the religious leadership and they're like, yeah, kind of smacks of truth. These guys, Caiaphas and his ilk would have been heavily on their heels. And as evidence of that, look at how afraid they are of the people in chapter 21 verse 23, a passage we've looked at a lot. You'll recall Jesus is in the temple area teaching. And he's being very well received there. And then along come the religious leaders, specifically the chief priests and the elders of the people. These are the big dogs, the big dogs who assemble with Caiaphas in chapter 26 at the priestly palace and the religious leaders can't refute the stuff that Jesus is saying. And they can't refute the things that Jesus has done in front of the Julian witnesses. So instead they go with one of the limpest of all arguments. But unfortunately, this is an argumentation style, which is really a logical fallacy that has become very popular around here in our culture in the last few years. They show up and they go with, where do you get off? By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority? Now this appeal to authority fallacy that they're employing here is a really tricky one and deceptively effective. Because what it does is it exploits this ring of authority that gets created in the circle of authority works like this. One group says we have authority because we did some paperwork. And then they confer that authority and licensing and blessing on somebody else who plays by their rules. And then that person can confer authority on someone else. And then that person can maybe give an award to the people who conferred the authority in the first place. And so you get a whole ring of people doing paperwork and guarding the boundaries of what is authoritative and peer reviewed and true. And as a result, any outsider can be checked and pushed further to the margin simply by saying, you don't have authority. You're not a part of the authority ring. But Jesus counters it beautifully. I mean, he can handle his own business. He's not worried about this. He says, I'll also ask you one question. If you answer me, I'll tell you about what authority I'm doing these things. John's baptism, where to come from? Was it from heaven or was it from men? And then they go off and they discuss it amongst themselves. They shouldn't need to discuss it at all. It's literally their job to know when something like this is happening and that it's from God. And if they don't know that, they've disqualified themselves. What purpose do they even serve? No, they know dang well where it's from. They just don't like the answer. So they get together. And like what is true doesn't even cross their minds. They instead think just strategically. And if we say from heaven, and Jesus is going to be like, well, then why didn't you do what John the Baptist said? Why don't you believe him? But then the religious leaders and their little enclave are like, but if we say for men, well, then the people are going to get mad because they all believe that John was a prophet. So they come back and they just say, you know, we don't know, we can't speak to that. No, that's too hard of a thing to define. No, the leadership of this country does not have a position on that issue. No, I'm sorry. I'm not a prophetologist. You would have to consult someone else to find out. I don't have a position on the issue. And Jesus is like, cool. Well, then neither while I tell you by what authority I'm doing these things and the stalemate persists. But you can see there as we revisit this passage that those are the actions. That's the thinking of a team that is on defense. They are freaked out by what's going on. And they're not in the power position we imagine them to be. I'm having a lot of fun poking around at this intrigue, this little dance that's happening in front of everybody and Passover, Swalen, Jerusalem. And I'm not done having fun with it yet. So we're going to talk about it more tomorrow. And I'll just pick up right where I left off. All right, thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
