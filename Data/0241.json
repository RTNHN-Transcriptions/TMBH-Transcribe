So we ran into them all around town and that was just fun because they're winning championships. Michael Jordan lived right there. I delivered pizza to his house a couple of times. So this is really entertaining to be around such greatness. And then it was also really entertaining when earlier this year ESPN put out this documentary called The Last Dance and it recounts the glory years of the Chicago Bulls and what was going on behind the scenes. It's just awesome. And so I got started on it and I'm like, oh, maybe we can watch this with the kids. This helped them understand some of the formative years for us, you know, as we were growing up around there and then the F-Bombs came out. So hey, watch with care if you don't want to hear that kind of stuff. What I will tell you is it's about as great a documentary series as you'll ever watch on excellence and goofy personality traits and the cost of winning. And you get this great behind the scenes look at Michael Jordan, the competitors sitting in his living room through every episode. And eventually it almost becomes a running joke that he talks about a slight that he either actually endured or just as likely imagined from another player or coach. And he looks into the camera and he's like, I took that personally. And then where his opponents would let their talking do the talking, Jordan would let his play and the scoreboard do the talking and was just always classy after he beat him. And then he'd move on having made his point. Likewise in Matthew chapter 11, John the Baptist, a character who I really think we should feel more sympathy for than impatience with seems to be not quite sure what to make of Jesus, and though his only job is to be quite sure what to make of Jesus. And so being a religious leader and having disciples of his own, he sends them to Jesus to ask, are you the one who was to commerce? Should we expect someone else? So what I'm getting from this moment is a little bit of impatience on the part of John the Baptist. Like, are you going to be the one who I described in these glorious terms? Because maybe not totally glorious things are happening from where I sit. Now, granted, he's sitting in prison on the shore of the Dead Sea and can't really see what's going on. And Jesus response to that is going to be, yeah, scoreboard. Granted, it's a more empathetic calling of scoreboard than what Michael Jordan did throughout his career. But nonetheless, Jesus just goes to the public record and is like, I think what's happened speaks for itself. So as we break down what Jesus says in response, I again, just want to reiterate, I don't want to sound like the guy who's saying that John the Baptist in those horrible circumstances should be just fine. I mean, this dude is a wild man. He is like the 10 times more version of me living out in the wild west. Well, him, I guess in the wild east, handling his own business, living off the land. I mean, he's what I imagine myself to be or aspire to be when I put on a flannel and go out in the snow and chop wood and endure mild inconvenience. And I worry about what it would be like to have that taken away from me. I love my freedom. And that's an important part of who I am. What if my whole life was based around that? I mean, if you think about it, that prison cell might have been the first roof John the Baptist slept under since he was a little kid and now sleeping under that roof is involuntary. So I get it. This is a difficult circumstance that messes with somebody's perception a little bit yet. He is asked the question. And here is Jesus reply as to whether he's the Messiah or maybe they should be expecting somebody else. Jesus replied, go back and report to John what you hear and see the blind received site. The lame walk and those who have leprosy are cured. The deaf here, the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor. Blessed is the man who doesn't fall away on account of me. Well, when you put it like that, I don't see how anybody could get this wrong. But let's go back and think about what John the Baptist was actually looking for. Matthew chapter three, you know, okay, John's out baptizing. He's wearing camel hair and stuff and got leather belt and eating bugs and some people come up and he's like, you're a brute of vipers and you got to repent and stuff and some stuff about Abraham and aha. Verse 11 of Matthew three, I baptized you with water for repentance, but after me will come one who's more powerful than I also. This is what he's expecting who sandals. I'm not fit to carry. He'll baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand and he'll clear the threshing floor gathering his weed into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire. And then Jesus shows up and more things happen. I got to say after refreshing my memory on what John the Baptist was saying, Jesus would be more sympathetic to him because that is in keeping with the most Messiah-ish of all the Messiah stuff in the Old Testament. That being Isaiah nine. This is the Christmas passage that we all know by heart as soon as we start to hear it. The people walking in darkness have seen a great light of those living in the land of the shadow of death. The light has dawned, you've enlarged the nation and increased their joy. They rejoice before you. A people rejoice at the harvest as men rejoice when dividing the plunder. I mean, this sounds huge and unmissable for as in the days of millions to feet, you've shattered the yoke, the burdensome, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of the oppressor. Jesus has not done that yet at the point that John is asking. Every warrior's boot used in battle in every garment, rolled in blood will be destined for the burning, will be fuel for the fire. That hasn't happened yet. For to us a child is born to us a son is given and the government will be on his shoulders and he'll be called wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace. None of that has happened yet. I mean, a child has been born, but none of the government stuff has happened yet. Of the increase of his government and peace, there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom. Jesus is not reigning over David's kingdom yet, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this. Remember this verse? Nothing fits the description at this point. And John is like, Hey, I don't know if you guys have heard about Herod Antepas or whatever, but he's crazy. He's his murderous people at times like somebody does a sexy dance. Sometimes that's enough for him to just kill people. And I kind of want my life's work to be targeted in the right direction. I'm over here in this prison where normally people get killed real quick. Then there's all these things that we said were going to happen. Like, no, no, we're really happening yet. So I'm not trying to nag or rush, but if there's somebody else I should be expecting. That would be helpful because I have like one job in life. And so far you haven't actually done the big gigantic things that are supposed to be there. And rather than unpacking all of the history of redemption and how everything is going to work out right now, Jesus response is instead to point John back to stuff in Isaiah, the same author, the same document that he's drawing on to create his expectations for Jesus and to remind him about all the other things that Isaiah said would happen as markers for the arrival of the kingdom. So let's just run through the list of what those things are. And I'm going to do it out of order from how Jesus said it. Because I'm going to go in order for how Isaiah listed him out. Isaiah 26 19, but your dead will live there. Bodies will rise. You who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy. Your do is like the do of the morning. The earth will give birth to her dead. Isaiah 29 18 says in that day, the deaf will hear the words of the scroll and out of gloom and darkness, the eyes of the blind will see this harkens back to all that stuff that we talked about with the senses being restored in Matthew chapter nine. And then Isaiah 35 five through six says, then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped, then will the lame leap like a deer in the mute tongue shout for joy. And then Isaiah 61 1 and 2. I'm going to go a little bit out of order because it makes my point better says the spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. What I think Jesus is doing here is twofold. One, he's saying, look at all the stuff that's happening, dude. Like you're fixating on the end game of the messianic prophecies and we're going to get to all of that. But there's a whole bunch more to the messianic prophecies in the very same book that you're looking at and all of those things that are a little more subtle and that you would expect to happen first. They are happening. In other words, you question me and I'm going scoreboard on you. Look at what is going on. What other explanation could there possibly be? The second thing that I think he's doing here that is genius that is often missed is he's harkening to clumps of verses that all not only include an awakening of the five senses but a liberation for the captive. Well, I bet when John encountered those verses back in the day, he thought of Israel being captive in Persia or maybe a harkening back to Israel being captive in Egypt. I didn't picture himself being captive in a cell waiting to get beheaded. But now that notion of liberation because the kingdom is at hand, the liberation that goes beyond the physical world, suddenly that is in view. Well, I think Jesus does even more than that to round out this thought. Remember the last thing that John said that this one who's coming who's going to bring the kingdom and be awesome would do. He said that his winnowing fork is in his hand and he will clear the threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire. Matthew chapter 13, just a couple pages ahead of where we are right now as Jesus responds to John has Jesus talking about people who want to rush toward this reckoning. They want to get to the place where God sorts everything out. James and John, they want Jesus to sort everything out. Samaritans are bad. Call down fire. Burn them. The disciples, even in Acts chapter 1, Jesus is risen from the dead and they're like, all right, now we can have our reckoning and get Israel straightened out. Are you going to get everything fixed there and Jesus is constantly pushing back on his followers desire to have that reckoning right now. But it's not like he's doing nothing. I mean, he's making it so that people can't talk and talk and people who can't see can see and people who can't walk and walk and people who are dead are alive again. And he's setting the captives free. So there's this beautiful, redemptive stuff that is happening in the meantime, but everybody wants that reckoning. Everybody wants to get to the end when they get vindicated and it looks like they were right. And you know what, if you're locked up in prison and you're suffering a horrible gross injustice, how much would you want on a very human level to have Jesus accelerate the timeline a little bit here and get past the part where you make people's legs better so they can walk. That's only temporary. Get to the big things. Everybody's like, ah, John was right all along. We never should have locked him up in that jail or maybe you don't even get beheaded. Even in the 2000 years since the events that Matthew describes, we've still seen Christians of all different stripes want to skip to the end of the process. All right, that's enough redeeming. All right, that's enough of the patient forbearance with the bad people. I'm obviously on team good, which makes me incentivize to want to wrap this thing up here and do the reckoning. Let's do the judging. Let's do the straightening out. Let's do the separating the wheat from the chaff thing. So the chaff can be gone. The wheat can be embraced and everybody can know who was right and who was wrong. But Jesus always pushes back on that indicating that he's got a much different timeline. Jesus got a much different agenda. Jesus is assuring John. Oh no, this is it, man. There's no way to misread this thing. All the stuff that's supposed to be happening is happening right on schedule. You were right cousin. Rest easy. You are vindicated whether everybody sees it yet or not. You advocated for the kingdom. You paved the way. You ran your leg of the race. You crushed it. I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to do and you did exactly what you're supposed to do. And if you suffer, just like I said, what happened in this kingdom, you suffered for exactly the right thing. But if every single time throughout history that any follower of Jesus or representative of the kingdom had been like, oh, things are just too bad, we need to end it all right now. We need to have our reckoning. If Jesus had gone with that at any point that people had wanted him to go with that, everything would be reckoned now. What would that mean for you and me and everybody we love outside looking in? That's what it would mean. So even though John is a great dude who did great stuff and we'll talk about that more in the passage that comes next, the impulse toward reckoning is one that has to be in the hands of the king. And no matter how desperately we might want to see the whole kingdom thing realized right now, no matter the cost, Jesus plan is far better for initiating that kingdom and how it unfolds than our plan, which is going to be very much shortsighted. What an interesting little passage. Hey, thanks. Everybody supports the program on Patreon at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. That's why we get to do this. Then I know I say it a lot, but I'm thankful a lot. So seriously, thanks for doing that. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
