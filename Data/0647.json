This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast when we're trying to figure out what the deal is Judas Iscariot. Why is he jerk? Why would he sell out his friend? And what we've I think come to conclude is that it's very unlikely that Judas Iscariot sold out Jesus just because he really liked money. He got paid somewhere between very modest money if we counted it in terms of just 30 coins of silver value given the coins that would have been in circulation at that time. I mean, we're talking like really modest money, like a hundred to 300 bucks if we just go with the modern equivalent of the silver value. If we go with the trading currency value of the time, you could maybe make a case for upwards of $9,000 equivalent to as I record this June of 2022 modern American money, but it still just doesn't seem like enough. That said, I've had a couple of conversations in the interim as we've been talking about this whole Judas and money thing that deserves a brief little sidetrack to go and track it down. And this is going to require us to skip ahead in the narrative. But you know what, we're on the trail of a mystery and so we're going to skip ahead in the narrative a little bit. Some of you have rightly noted that the Bible talks about Judas taking that money in the Luke and Acts account and using it to buy a field. That's got to be an Acts one, right? Acts one, Acts one, okay. They replaced Judas with Matthias. Here's where they clarify it. Acts 18 of Acts one with the reward he Judas got for his wickedness. Judas bought a field there. He fell headlong. His body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. Yes, we are going to talk about the whole intestine body burst open thing a whole bunch more. That is obviously pretty juicy history, but there's a question here and that is dang. How could he have bought a field if that's all the more money that we're talking about over in Matthew. If we run into what for now we're just going to have to treat as an apparent contradiction. We will break that down more specifically when we get to this point in our conversation. But in Matthew 27, all the chief priests get together. Jesus is being bound up. He's going to be handed over to Pilate, but then it says when Judas verse three of Matthew 27 who had betrayed him saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned to the 30 silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. I have sinned, he said, for I've betrayed innocent blood. What's that to us? They reply and that's your responsibility. So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself again fully acknowledged that we're going to have to get into the way he hang himself or his intestines all come out. Can that both be true? I mean, maybe if you were terrible at hanging, I guess. And also here we're throwing the coins in at the feet of the religious leaders and then they go and buy a field. Like I said in Regent that part, verse six, the chief priests picked up the coins and said, yeah, it's against a lot of put this into the treasury since it's blood money. So they decided to use the money to buy the potters field as a burial place for foreigners. So we've got at least an apparent surface contradiction there as well. All of that aside, Matthew confirms in Matthew 27 that we're definitely still talking about 30 coins. The number doesn't go up here. And somehow those 30 coins were enough to buy a burial field. I don't know about that. It seems hard to imagine that you could buy land in one of the five biggest cities on planet earth for less than 10,000 bucks. And as we discovered the high end number that Judas got paid here, if we go with the most valuable way of calculating what 30 silver coins could have been is 9,000 bucks. I mean, give or take a little bit for inflation and all of that kind of stuff. You'd have to go to some pretty ludicrous extremes to try to make the case that Judas got paid way more than that. I guess maybe if there's some other coin that history forgot and it was a really, really big super heavy silver coin that's just gone maybe, but it couldn't be a Roman coin because everything above this value flips over into gold to account for massive amounts of individual silver genaris. So how then did that amount of money buy a field? I don't know. My first suspicion is that the money that got paid for Judas's betrayal was somehow part of what was used to buy this field. And the only part that would have been interesting or important for the biblical authors would be the part that was from the betrayal. I think presumably this must have been supplemented by something else because I went back through it and it looks like the people who study this for a living are saying that we have 60 roughly original real estate listings or receipts from this era of the classical world around Jerusalem, even Rome, and that the cheapest chunk of land that I could find on any of those receipts was 10,000 denari. And that was a receipt for a developed property with an actual building and housing on it, which means that the 30 denari we're talking about here, it's just really hard for me to believe that you could go by land in Jerusalem for that amount. So I think it's a really valid question that comes up there, but I'm still at the same place I was before to say, nah, it looks like this really wasn't that much money, like good money, but not crazy money, not betrayal worthy money. I'm having fun thinking about what makes Judas tick. And I think we all know that there's a grander explanation going on here. His behavior defies reason to such an extent that we have to go and look at the spiritual side of things. And that's where we're headed next on has going to be interesting too. On Saturday, we did a bonus episode in that bonus episode. I announced a new thing. It's called eyes up. Eyes up is a thing that a couple of friends and I built in response to what we've heard from you over the years of doing the 10 minute Bible hour on YouTube and here a whole bunch of you have reached out with great questions, great ideas, wanting to workshop ideas to think about what to do with your church or in your own life to communicate the values of the kingdom, the message of the kingdom to this very weird, very unprecedented, contentious moment in the history of planet earth. Your questions have been awesome and insightful. And because of my lack of bandwidth, because all the stuff that I do on the internet, I have not been able to engage with those to the degree that I would like to enter my friend Aaron Utech, who's been around the channel for a long time, enter eyes up. The idea of eyes up is to help pastors, churches, individuals, people who are thinking in terms of kingdom values and how to articulate and live out kingdom values in this weird unprecedented moment of planet earth. We're trying to help anybody in that crowd think it through game it out and swap good ideas with each other for something makes sense and is working and is human and kind and charitable and in keeping with the values of the kingdom. So we got a cute little baby website for that. It's go eyes up.com. What it is is pretty succinctly explained right there on the front page. But part of eyes up is a new podcast called good ideas for churches. And I will be a part of that a little bit. But for the most part, Aaron Utech is going to be the guy who runs with that. And that podcast is exactly what it sounds like. We bring people on who have a good idea for church. We have got an idea for how to express the values of the kingdom to their community in a new and effective way. Cool. We're going to have them share that. Maybe they have an idea for how to make church make more sense and just work better. Cool. We're going to bring people on and have them talk about that. And then the point of the podcast is you can listen to other people's best ideas and think about whether or not it makes sense for you or it's helpful for you in your context at all. Take it, leave it, integrate it, adapt it, whatever. It just seems to me that there would be great value in comparing our best ideas and putting our heads together a little more. And I think that format really lends itself to it. So if that sounds interesting to you or if you just want to be cool and supportive is me and the people I work with are trying to think of things to do to make things better, I'd be super grateful if you would go and check out that podcast. It's available. You'll find it right on the front page of goisup.com where you can just search good ideas for churches anywhere you get podcasts or you can just follow the links down in the show notes, hitting the subscribe button, making a little comment or something after you've listened to a few episodes to decide what you think. That would be really welcome and really helpful as well. Again, the new project that Aaron is running with is called Eyes Up. It is a not for profit help for churches and leaders who are trying to figure out how to say kingdom stuff to a weird moment in planet earth. And it comes with a new podcast called Good Ideas for Churches that I'm on occasionally and that Aaron will be in charge of and the guy hosting. Thanks for letting me share that with you. More Judas stuff tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
