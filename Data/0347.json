This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and we are going to talk about a topic today that has all the potential in the world to be offensive because we're going to talk about offendedness. And as you know, if you've hung out with me for any period of time, I am of the deep conviction that offendedness is the laziest and least useful of all of the human emotions, that much gets done there that is particularly productive. So as always, I got to turn over my cards because you've got to take those things into account because I didn't write the Bible and I don't own it and I could be wrong about a couple things or a few things or all the things. And I wouldn't know because I would think I was right and then I would charge ahead and be like, I think this is the best read on it and I would just keep saying stuff like that. But I could be wrong. So with that in mind, we get to this passage in Matthew chapter 15 about offendedness or at least it starts that way. And I think the way it's framed in the language of the text isn't particularly flattering to the idea of offendedness, but it gets us into some interesting thoughts about the human phenomenon, human emotions and how that overlaps with the Bible and what Jesus is doing here. So let me just read the thing. Matthew chapter 15 starting in verse 12, the Pharisees have come up from Jerusalem. They're mad about not hand washing properly. Jesus fiercely verbally retaliates in a way that embarrasses the Pharisees in front of everybody and equates them with God's chosen people who are absolutely rebuked in Isaiah. What was it? 27. It was 27 29. I'm looking. It was 29. My bad. Isaiah 29 in the Old Testament. Then Jesus turns to the crowds as we talked about yesterday and was like, Hey, we got to rethink the whole clean unclean thing. It's not about what goes into you that makes you unclean. It's about what is in you and what comes out of you that makes him unclean. And that as we talked about yesterday was a sea change, which prompts now, Matthew 1512. Then the disciples came to him, him being Jesus and asked, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this? And we'll break down Jesus answer that's forthcoming here in just a minute, but I want to give you a little bit of a preview of it. He doesn't care. Not at all. He has no regard for their dumb offendedness and he's going to pivot so hard against that that he's effectively going to tell them like, Why are you listening to anything these people say? But my friends, what an interesting moment until very recently, most of society view defendedness the way I do. It's not very productive. It doesn't get much done. If you have a real problem, getting offended isn't the way to solve it. If you have a real problem, you go to the person you have a gripe with and you work the thing out. If you're taking angles or being manipulative, well, your offendedness is just a smokescreen for what you really want anyway, so then your offendedness is a joke. And if you're so offended that you can't go and talk to the person, then you don't really want things to be better anyway. You just want your offendedness because you like it. And so you would go and tell somebody not that long ago, like, I'm offended and they'd be like, Buck up. Well, okay, well, you have a recourse to go and address that. Go address your offendedness. There's a way. But something has changed. There's a little bit of blood in the water. And you know, I guess when there's a little bit of blood in the water, it's not just like this group or that group sees it and thinks to themselves, oh, we can exploit something here when there's ideological blood in the water. People of all positions realize, wait, that trick works. Like I can do that and I get political power. I get clout. I can defeat people in arguments on Twitter. Wait, I could do that and I wouldn't even have to confront the people that I'm offended by or irritated with. I could just complain about that and maybe get sympathy or even money or a Kickstarter for me on the internet. Are you kidding me? Offendedness is the best thing ever. And it just flipped from the stuff that we got taught, I think rightly taught as kids to what it is now. Offendedness is currency. It's like Bitcoin except Bitcoin has gone up and down over the course of the last decade. The currency value relative to the US dollar of offendedness has only gone up. Now coin to the moon, bro. But despite how optimistic all of the offendo coin speculators are about its futures, let's think about the actual value that this produces. Let's try to be very generous here. What good does offendedness do? Well, maybe you could argue that it is a form, a passive, very passive form of sticking up for yourself and saying, I'm not going to take that anymore. But I say it's a very passive form because offendedness then says, I'm offended. Now the impetus is on someone else to do something about it. Either the person who has offended me needs to change or someone needs to pick up the banner of my offendedness and go and do something about my offendedness for me. And by the way, if you're listening to me here and you're like, oh, I bet that guy's a pretty hardcore Trump supporter. And he's talking about lefty snowflakes. You're wrong. And I also would say that if you're like, ah, this guy, he always flirts just a little bit with this whole like manby, pamby, liberal thing. I think he's doing it again. And he's trying to implicitly criticize people on the right. I honestly think you're wrong. I say this respectfully to all of you, my friends who might imagine that I mean this thing or that other thing in a subtle way that no, in earnestness and I hope humility, what I'm talking about here is something that I see as a cultural phenomenon that impacts all of us and that is a temptation for anybody of any ideological, political, religious or a religious stripe to employ. And what I'm positing is that I know this from observing other people and from the shame and ineffectiveness of the times that I have tried to play this game that I just don't think it's a good idea. I don't think it's productive and that I don't think Jesus is very impressed by it either in this moment. So what was I talking about here before the disclaimer that offendedness might be productive for it? So yes, maybe it could be productive in that it notifies other people. It puts them on notice that you're not going to take this anymore. Now offendedness in and of itself has no action plan or action ability. So I don't know what I'm not going to take this anymore means if offendedness is the only play that really doesn't get it done. But the downside of offendedness starts with what I was just talking about that the balls in somebody else's court to do something now I'm offended. There's not a dang thing wrong with articulating a gripe. There is a dang thing wrong with that being the only thing that is contributed here because that doesn't produce change. And what that really communicates is that change isn't what's interesting. What's interesting or appealing is whatever you get in terms of social clout or credibility or influence or even money by expressing your offendedness in a social situation. Defendedness is further complicated by the fact that it is a vicarious human expression as often as it is an articulated individual human expression. How often have you been in an environment and somebody says something or does something or acts out or whatever. And your first thought is, oh, that is going to offend people. I mean, for me, that happens a lot. I don't think I'm offended, but I'm anticipating the offendedness of the room or of somebody or I'm judging that lady that looks like that or that guy that looks like that. They seem like the types that we get offended. Oh, I bet you're offending them. That's not a good reflection on me, but it is something I do. And in this way, offendedness can be vicarious where nobody's actually offended, but we're also sure everyone else will be offended that in a way we get second hand offendedness. Overwhelmingly, the sum net result of both firsthand offendedness, which it would make sense that the Pharisees were feeling at this moment or second hand offendedness, which the disciples are ascribing to the Pharisees. I don't know if they knew that the Pharisees were offended or if they're just filling in the gaps and assuming that they were going to be offended. But the net result of both layers of types of offendedness is one, not much actual effective change to address problems and make things better. Two, tons of relational mistrust because this is like the GM that airs out gripes with a player on his professional sports team in the media. Instead of working it out with the players and individual, usually if they're having a contract dispute and it plays out like that, that player is going to end up playing for somebody else. That technique doesn't usually work very well. It ruins trust. And the third thing that these multiple layers of offendedness produces is a collective inability to actually think about the merits of the situation or of the topics at hand. I think about what just happened here. The Pharisees say, we think you should wash your hands this way and we are put out that you didn't. Jesus is like, yeah, you guys are clowns. That's a stupid thing and you're being totally hypocritical. And no, I'm not going to make the people who follow me bear that burden and maybe you ought to take a look at your own soul. Wow, dang, that was intense. Then he turns to the people who listen to the Pharisees and is like, yeah, I'll tell you how things actually are. Clean and unclean thing. It actually works like this. And then the disciples come back instead of being like, whoa, that is a landmark moment in this whole discussion. Dang, I'd never thought about it that way. Their very next thing is to come back to Jesus and be like, the Pharisees are offended. What a limp, ineffectual response that is. And so Jesus is going to demonstrate some pleasant impatience in his response that we're going to get to tomorrow. And surely some of that impatience is born out of, did you all hear what I just said? And you think the more powerful of the two things that just occurred is not what I just said authoritatively about clean and unclean and taboos in our society. You think it's that those people and those outfits are offended and that they're broadcasting that with their body language and they want people to now come groveling back to them and begging them to please, please, please, please still like us and please not be offended. You think that is the more powerful important thing of the two things that just happened? Huh. So this is one of those conversations where I in my not infinite wisdom feel like, and I could be wrong, that in order to understand the social moment that we're seeing here, we sort of have to sort it out in line to the social moment that we're feeling here because the word offended is the key word in this exchange. And that has a lot of loadedness. As always, my friends, you do not have to agree with a dang thing that I say or agree with my assessments on stuff like this at all. But should you disagree, thanks in advance and thanks after the fact for always doing such a good job of not being just offended, but instead either disagreeing and moving on or disagreeing and shooting me a nice note. I like your style and I appreciate how you are and I'm excited to break down Jesus response with you, manana. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
