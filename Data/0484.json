It's like a pre invitation invitation. It's like an invitation to think about going to the wedding. We don't have all the details nailed down yet, but we know it's going to be on this date in like a year and a half and we want you to get that thing inked in on your calendar right now. I remember the first time I saw one of those ever is like, what the heck is this the thing now? And I asked several people who were much older than me and they were like, I've never seen that. Like it used to be some people in invitation and that's that. Well, why did that change? I think the save the date thing, it's like a countermeasure to the, I'm not pointing any fingers here, like I'm part of this culture in this moment in history too, but it's kind of a countermeasure to this new found social acceptance toward flakiness that we all have just learned to live with and probably contribute to a little bit as well. People find that if you want to plan a thing, that is a much larger endeavor at this point. Well, this is not a new phenomenon that you want people to show up for your thing and you want to try to plan it in advance. But how the invitation got delivered in the past and different parts of the world was a little bit different in a more agrarian moment in history in a more localized, slower-paced moment in history. Like say in the first century AD in the ancient Near East or Judea or Galilee, you would just simply let people know like, Hey, this thing is coming up and it's going to happen and we understand people are traveling on foot and it's going to be a while for everybody to get there. So we're going to let you know like when all the preparations are made and then we'll send somebody to let you know that, yeah, it's happening and then yeah, it's knock out whatever you're doing. And if you can just start making your way over to the event, then we're going to eat and we're going to drink and it's going to be a multi-day thing and it's going to be a big expensive, happy thing that's going on. That is the kind of save the date that is in view when we get into Matthew chapter 22 and yet another rapid fire kingdom parable from Jesus in this ongoing conversation that is happening between him and the religious leadership and also the people who are standing around listening to him talk not just to the religious leadership, his enemies, but also about the religious leadership. So what we've seen, just a refresher in Matthew chapter 21 is Jesus has finally made his way into Jerusalem, he rides in on a donkey and people are excited and they're throwing their stuff down and yelling Hosanna to the son of David and they're like, he's a prophet, which is close. It's pretty good. And he goes into the temple and he clears it out of all the money changing and the ick that's going on there because it's his father's house and people are even more excited about him after that in chapter 21. And the religious leaders who are getting to a place of complete, open hostility toward him are like, oh, we got to do something. Let's get him to denounce what all these people are saying. And they're like, Hey, denounce the kids for saying Hosanna to the son of David. And Jesus is like, yeah, here's some Bible for you. Like this Bible has got in there. It says from the lips of children and infants, you've ordained praise. And so reference to Psalm eight, I think is what we decided. And then Jesus goes from there back out to the little suburb, the little bedroom community of Bethany where he's staying. He comes back the next morning and he's hungry. He wants to get some figs off of the fig tree, but there's no figs on there and he curses it. Odd little cursing sets us in to the line of thought that we've got cooking right now through the rest of 21 and to 22 and actually well beyond that because this cursing is metaphorical for him saying you should be bearing fruit. You hold yourself out as bearing fruit, but you're not bearing fruit. So may you never bear fruit again. It's a, it's a rejection and it's a harsh one. So while there is definitely a lesson about faith mingled into it, the immediate context tells us that no, he met what he said and the imagery that was there is pointed toward those religious leaders who have been missing the point of God and God's redemptive work and Jesus and everything. So they come to him in chapter 21 verse 23 and they want to get after him about where he gets off doing all this stuff, where do you get the authority to do this stuff? And Jesus is like, well, how about I ask you a question and then I'll tell you where did John's baptism come from? Was that from heaven or from men? And they're all like, oh, we didn't think he was going to ask us a question. Hang on just a second. And they run or the side and they're like, I don't know. We can't say is from God. It'll be like, why didn't you listen to him? And we can't say that the power is from nothing like just from people. Everybody thinks John was legit. So we're going to go with, I don't know. We don't know. We decided we don't know. We're going with, we don't know. And Jesus is like, cool. All right. Well, neither will I tell you about what authority I'm doing. These things. And then Jesus rolls right into the first parable that we looked at and a week ago, two weeks ago, whatever it is. And this is the one about the two kids who get told to go work in the vineyard and the one's like, yeah, I'm not doing it. And then he's like, yeah, I probably should though. And he does it. And the other one's like, oh, yeah, for sure, I will go work in the vineyard father. But then he's like, yeah, I'm not doing it. And he doesn't go and do it. And then Jesus is like, which one of them got it right? And begrudgingly the religious leaders are like, yeah, the one that actually went and worked. And Jesus is like, yeah, cool. And I tell you that the people you find deplorable, the prostitutes, tax collectors, they're going to enter the kingdom of God ahead of you. This is a continuation of that rejection of the Jewish leadership theme that is very heavy, handily foreshadowed in the rebuke, the cursing of the fig tree that I was just talking about. Well, these guys aren't off the hook yet. Jesus rolls right into another parable that we've also already talked about. And this is the one about the landowner and the vineyard and the sky owns it. He wants his vineyard to make money and so he rents it out to some tenants and the deal is they're going to get a percentage and he's going to get a percentage and he wants them to be really, really good at it and for it to be fruitful. And then everybody wins. But even though that was the deal, when it comes time for harvest and payoff, they're like, yeah, we're not really into that. So the landowner sends servants and there's like, yeah, we'll kill them and they kill them. And then the landowner sends some more representatives. They kill them too. Then the landowner is like, what is going on? And rather than just punishing them, he's patient with them and he sends his own son. He's like, well, listen to my son. And not only did they not listen, they kill him too opportunistically. And then pretty clearly you would expect that the landowner is going to be real mad and Jesus asks the religious leaders like, what do you think that landowner is going to do guys? And they're like, well, he's probably going to kill the tenants who murdered his kid and then give the vineyard to somebody who will actually do it right. And Jesus implicitly is like, yep, but he says it. Thusly he says, if you never read the scriptures, the stone, the builders rejected has become the capstone. The Lord has done this and it's marvelous in his eyes. Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed. Who's getting crushed on and by that stone? Well, it would appear to be the religious leaders, the people who hold themselves out as being fruitful, but it's a fraud. They're not actually fruitful. The people who hold themselves out as being those who give access to God and help people know God, but it's a fraud. They actually do the exact opposite and obscure God from people. And then chapter 21 ends with the chief priests being like, I think he was talking about us. It says when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus parables, they knew he was talking about them. Well, yeah, you think? And they looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet. So that's the point of tension that we land on. But then we get into chapter 22. And oh, here comes another parable. And I'm sure the Pharisees feel like Muslims in the 1990s with action movies where they're like, no, not another action movie. We're always the bad guys in these. Like, I hate this. I'm sure the Pharisees are like, not another parable. We're always the bad guys in the parables. Things always get worse every time he tells one, but you can't make him stop telling it because the people like him and they're listening. So then it says in chapter 22, verse one, Jesus spoke to them again and parables saying the kingdom of heavens like king prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who'd been invited to the banquet to tell him to come, but they refused to come. Then he sent some more servants and said, tell those who've been invited that I've prepared my dinner, my oxen and fat and cattle have been butchered and everything's ready. Come to the wedding banquet. So the parable is starting off with a problem, but not really a twist. My guess is that people could imagine something like this happening. And this is this exciting moment in the life of a family and surely the invitations have already been sent out, save the dates and a primitive sense, if you will. And everybody knows that they're supposed to be on notice because this thing is about to happen. But we're talking about an era before refrigeration here. Sid Meier's Civilization 5 taught me that. And because we're pre refrigeration, when it's time to eat, it's kind of time to eat because you have to murder some animals right at that moment to have them fresh and available. It's not going to be feast worthy if you wait several days or a week. We're ready right now to eat. And you guys were supposed to finish up whatever you were doing and you were supposed to come. But that's what friends do. That's what we did when your kid got married and you invited us to the thing. And what we see in verse 3 is it wasn't even like, yeah, probably like, yeah, be right down, be right down. It was like, no, refusal. I'm not going to the banquet. Well, culturally, the original audience wouldn't know. If these invites are going out, they're not haphazard. They're not an afterthought. These people already agreed to go to the banquet. But now they refuse to go to the banquet that is in celebration of the father and his son and that they're supposed to be celebrating too. They were intended to be guests of honor provided for and cared for and sharing in the celebration and the harvest and the optimism about what was going to happen next in this family. But they don't want to be there. I'm going to metaphorically press the pause button. Why do I say metaphorically? I'm literally going to press the pause button right here. And we're going to pick up right where we left off tomorrow. This is a parable that probably needs to be broken down in three parts. It's fun. It's interesting, but it's also super sobering because reading this as a reflection back on what we encountered in chapter 21 makes it pretty clear that no, there is a denunciation going on here. There is a rejection of the behavior of the Jewish leadership and it's scalding. This is not happening quickly. Jesus is tripling and quadrupling down on it. And so we'll take our time and try to get to the bottom of what all of it means starting tomorrow, picking up where we left off. I like that we get to do this and you're the reason we get to. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
