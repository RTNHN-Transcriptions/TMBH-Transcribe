And one of those is probably the alibi things. Let's say you're getting accused of stealing cookies. You ate all the cookies out of the cookie jar and you weren't supposed to. That seemed innocuous. I went through like four or five things in my brain that were actually like really bad crimes and I think would make it far less fun for us to game it out. So we're going to go with something easy. Stealing cookies. You get accused of it. Well, speed dial defense number one would probably be alibi. I wasn't even here when the cookies got stolen. It's just simple logic, right? Speed dial defense number two might be to offer a more plausible theory. Well there are a whole bunch of crumbs all around Kyle's seat right there and he has chocolate chips smudges on his shirt and his lips. Maybe it was Kyle. A third defense that I think we keep on speed dial is the appeal to our track record. If you don't steal things from people, you might just be like, I don't steal things. You all know me. I don't take people's stuff without permission. I did not steal the cookies. But there's a fourth one that I think we all have on speed dial as well. This is a little more complex technique, but it's very effective. This is the one where we point out the flaws in our accuser's assumption of our motives. Are you tracking with me there? So in this case, let's say that you are celiac and you just got accused of stealing a bunch of chips of hoi cookies and eating them all. Well, I mean, you could come back and be like, why would I do that? I'm celiac if I eat the cookies, it would destroy my digestive system. I'm clearly not the person who ate those. Your assumption of motives doesn't make any sense and your charges entirely collapse on themselves. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 12, Jesus is about to be accused of something that doesn't make sense. It's an irrational accusation that collapses on itself and it's going to be pretty easy for Jesus to point to the absurd accusation and demonstrate its absurdity and therefore the absurdity of his accusers. But today, all we're going to look at is the setup to this accusation that Jesus is going to have a pretty easy time knocking down with one of the defenses that we all have on speed dial. Matthew 12 starting in verse 22, then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute and Jesus healed them so that he could both talk and see. Well, that's nice. In fact, it's a familiar nice. We've seen that demon possession can manifest somehow in physical ailment. So okay, yeah, Jesus shows up. He heals a lot of people. I don't know about you, but I'm starting to leave him. He's a track of how many times demons have been cast out or people have been healed. It's just so commonplace. And if you weren't paying close attention, you might start to think that Matthew is just being lazy here and he was like, uh, yeah, I'm just trying to in order give you all the accounts of all the times Jesus healed people or something. Be careful reading of the text indicates that it's not the case. These things are not coming up as happenstance or just because that was the next thing that happened. Matthew is advancing a much larger thematically driven narrative with when these accounts of healings come up. And that's part of the reason that it looks like we get repeat healings from time to time or healings that look a lot like other healings that we've already seen. The reality is Matthew is leaning on an earlier instance of a healing to make one theological point a few chapters back. And now he's leaning on another healing. That's just a normal Tuesday night for Jesus. I mean, he's probably healed, blind and mute people constantly all the time, but here it fits into the narrative in such a way that it is going to advance a point that Matthew is making that we will get to in just a minute. Verse 23, all the people were astonished and said, could this be the son of David? Now, this is starting to ring a bell. So we have the blind and the mute thing going on. We have the demon possession thing and we have that attached to the notion of the son of David. I'm just going to go to my Bible here and flip back a couple of chapters and ah ha. There's a reason it's familiar. Verse 27 of Matthew chapter nine. Do you remember this one? As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him calling out, have mercy on us, son of David. Whoa. So we're one verse into this anecdote from a few chapters back and we've got two parallel features to the passage we're looking at today in Matthew 12. I got the blind thing and you have the son of David thing. Okay. When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him and he asked them, do you believe that I'm able to do this? Yes, Lord, they replied. Then he touched their eyes and said, according to your faith, will it be done to you and their sight was restored? Jesus warned them sternly. See, the no one knows about this, but they went out and spread the news about him all over that region, which causes a problem because then in verse 32, while they were going out, a man who was demon possessed. Okay. Here we go. Now we have a third feature that matches up with today's passage and this demon possessed person could not talk. My mind is blown. It's for straight parallels. It's like the mashed potatoes and devils tower. This means something. And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel, but the Pharisees said it is by the Prince of demons that he drives out demons. Now when we covered that passage, we just looked at in Matthew nine, several episodes back, I mentioned we were going to come back to these themes because it comes up again in a few chapters. And now we are there in Matthew nine, the version of Jesus who has not yet condemned Bethsaida and a Chorazine who has not yet condemned the spirit of the age who has not yet engaged with two Sabbath controversies with the Pharisees. That version of Jesus from a simpler time restores sight and restores speech. And again, we see the connection between the demon possession and the inability to speak on the part of the one guy. And for the people in the story here who think that's pretty awesome, they look at that and they're viewing Jesus as the son of David. Well, what does that title mean? We covered it before. It's pretty obvious though, right? I mean, the son of David fits with the whole theme of Matthew starting with the genealogy in chapter one, I mean, David's right here in this list of people. The idea that Jesus is the king of this promised kingdom and that that kingdom is the one that was pointed toward in Isaiah and the prophets. I mean, that's the whole point of everything that Matthew is driving at. So to have these guys rightly identify Jesus as the son of David, the descendant of David, but the descendant of David, the one who will reign on David's throne forever establishing this eternal kingdom. Well, that's a big deal. That means their eyes are not just physically opened. They're metaphorically opened. And that miracle in Matthew nine, as well as the miracle we're looking at today in Matthew 12 are both in keeping with what happens in between in Matthew chapter 11 when once again, John the Baptist disciples come and ask Jesus whether he's the actual one or they should expect someone else. And Jesus references a bunch of stuff from Isaiah 42. Again, one of the servant song passages saying, go back and report to John what you hear and see the blind received sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf here, the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor. So like I'm telling you, Matthew is an absolute master and he's stitching all of this stuff together in a way that makes it clear to the reader that the person whose five senses are working is the one who God has enabled to see the truth of who Jesus is that Jesus is the son of David and the one whose senses are not working, the one who's blind and deaf and mutant can't figure anything out is the one that's like, I, you're casting out demons in the name of an even bigger demon. What? But which of these two conclusions makes more sense? But there's another layer here to what Matthew is doing, the title son of David. Did you notice that here in this anecdote in Matthew nine where the blind guys get healed and as well in Matthew 12, when people see this casting out of the demon that's causing the blindness and the muteness and then what do they say they say, could this be the son of David? Why is the son of David attached to this mercy thing? Well, because think about the promises surrounding the son of David. Think about yesterday's episode and the four servant songs that we get in Isaiah, the idea that this servant is the one who would be descended from David is the one who will ultimately sit on this great eternal throne. Well, what comes with that? The son of David will heal the people. The son of David will defeat evil and heal the land, straighten things out, make it right. So all of these individual miracles are, I mean, like the best day ever for these people who were afflicted as individuals who just happened to be standing there when Jesus was making a theological point. But the larger implication that in chapter nine, only a few people were getting in chapter 11, even John the Baptist disciples weren't quite getting yet. But now in chapter 12, that even the crowds are starting to get is that this full picture of the Messiah is not the conquering king who defeats all the enemies militarily, rather this is a king who brings healing and restoration. And ultimately, though the times will be tumultuous on the way there will bring peace. So the crowds see this and arguably miraculous, awesome, good thing. And like, this is great. This is what we've been waiting for. But the Pharisees see it and who knows, I mean, we've broken down their motives a lot, jealousy, defense of the nation, whatever. They're like, no, okay, well, we can't argue that something miraculous just happened. Okay, we'll grant you that, but we can argue about the source. And we think it is from the Lord of flies, the Lord of dung. Yeah, those linguistic connections are all present in the name of the Elzebub, who is the Prince of demons, the right hand man of Satan himself. That is the power that this Jesus is summoning. Now back to what we were talking about at the beginning is not going to be very hard for Jesus to deflect this really limp thrust of the rhetorical accusatory sword of the Pharisees here. I mean, what he's doing doesn't really look like what demons do with wrecking people's lives. I mean, the whole Beelzebub thing, the Lord of the flies play on words pun that goes at that name. I mean, that's where you get in lore, the idea of someone opening their big maw and a bunch of flies symbolizing pestilence, go flying out of their mouth like in what was that the green mile? This association of flies and death and darkness and disease is still something that lingers with us in culture and that at the time was very attached to the name Beelzebub. No, you get this pure, glorious, awesome thing happening with Jesus. And then you get this disgusting, weird, revolting connotation with Beelzebub. I think Jesus is going to have a pretty easy time deflecting this accusation. And that is what we're going to look at tomorrow. Big thanks to everybody supports the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. I think it's really fun that we get to do this. And the reason that we get to do this is because some of you support the program. So seriously, thanks a ton for doing that. More on this tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
