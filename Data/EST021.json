And right now, we're going through Esther. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and I just repeated a thing. It's Monday, right? Which means that my wife just said the exact same thing. That's on purpose. Just say that on Mondays so that anybody who's new can get oriented real quick and get a sense of what this thing is and how it works and what to expect. By the way, if you're new, thank you for showing up. Thanks for trying this thing out. I hope you super like it. You can jump in wherever and if you enjoy it, you can go back and binge from the beginning of the whole big series that we first did on the book of Matthew, which is I don't be intimidated. 800 episodes, but they go fast and I think they're fun. And then we did another season that was much shorter, just I don't know, 60 some. I think it ended up being about 70 episodes where we just went through a book of the Bible per day, including a little bit of bonus stuff. And now you're coming in here at the beginning of our third series, which is on the book of Esther, which brings me to something I want to talk about. But before I talk about the thing, back to my wife, she has to me the most enchanting voice I have ever heard ever. And I think she beautifies this space so nicely by jumping in and just saying hello to everyone and occasionally saying a couple things on the way out the door. And I'm very grateful to her to lending that touch of elegance to this otherwise dude in a basement, rather clumsy, brusque thing that I do here about this book of Esther business. We are working our way toward a place where we are ready to dive deep into the book of Esther and understand the cultural nuance and historical nuance and all of that stuff. We're looking at the book of Ezra. We're looking at the book of Nehemiah. We're looking at the book of Daniel. And all of this is meant to give us a glimpse at this little sliver of the Bible that happens against the backdrop of the Persian Empire. Persia is not on screen much in the Bible. So we don't think about them very much. And the whole Persia story arc of history rounds out in between the Old Testament and the New Testament. So we never really even hear what happened to them or where they went in the Bible. You got to go to extra biblical history to fill that stuff in. So as a result, as you know, I think this time period is oft overlooked. I also think this time period is wildly interesting. And these few books of the Bible that deal with this, they all really compliment each other. And that's why we're trying to lay out the story deeply. And it seems like about once a week, I make some kind of apologetic for why we're coming at it this way. And I don't know why I do that. I don't think I feel terribly insecure about it. I have not received one note from anybody at all who's like, what the heck? You said we were going to talk about Esther. I like Esther. And we're not talking about Esther yet. That was really mean. I made that person's voice sound super, super dumb. But what? No, it's not mean because that person doesn't exist. I haven't heard from you at all. What I have heard is just a lot of excitement, enthusiasm and appreciation that I share with you for how much the Bible is held out as happening in real moments in time with real people in real places. And then unlike some other religions that just unapologetically hold out their narratives and their stories as being entirely fanciful and set in a fantasy moment, a fantasy land and entirely otherworldly thing, the Bible doesn't do that. That's different. I think there's a God behind it or not. You got to acknowledge that is a different way of approaching it. And indeed, whether you think there's a God or not, the Bible has a remarkable track record of the people, places and things that it says should be in certain places in certain times, being right where they're supposed to be when you go and look at extra biblical history. And I think that adds a layer of extra fun. But yeah, it's like this. I was thinking about this the other day. I was watching an older person talking with who I assume would be a grandchild. I'd have been a great grandchild in public at a restaurant. I could tell they were explaining some things about when they were younger. And I was watching this conversation. I was thinking, you know, that kid, they haven't seen any fads come and go yet. They haven't seen the churn of history yet. Everything that they've lived through and had their eyes open and been aware for has looked and felt pretty much the same. But that old person who is patiently delighting and sharing that story, they've seen that a lot of churn. That person's old enough that commercial flight was probably not much of a thing when they were young and just seen a lot of turnover, I guess. And for the kid, there's not going to be much difference in their mind when they imagine the 1960s being talked about in a story and the 1990s being talked about in a story. But if you're someone who lived in either of those decades or somebody who's just old enough to have culturally as most knowledge about the difference between those decades, you're like, Oh, dang, that's super different. And someday the kid will understand. And what I'm trying to do here is move myself from being a kid who looks back at history and is like, yeah, all of the Old Testament, like, I don't know, they were like robes or some kind of like bathroom robes or something. They had sticks probably and like maybe they had like swords, rocks or I don't know. They lived in the law of huffles or something. There are probably some kings and things. I don't, I don't know exactly how it all worked, but it's all pretty much the same. I'm trying to understand this better and share the journey with you to flesh that out and be like, no, the 600s BC are way different than the 500s BC in the same way that the 1800s AD are way different than 2000 AD way different. And so in pursuit of that, we've looked at the way these little micro kingdoms of the Hebrew world of Israel and Judah and their neighbors. I mean, that was, that was a dominant story. These little kingdoms, these little people groups and tribes all packed into this little area. That was status quo for hundreds of years of what we look at in the Bible. And then we get into the 600s BC and stuff goes crazy. And Assyria has been on the scene for a long time, but now the idea of mega empires and fighting for who gets to be the next mega empire, it's the real deal and history changes dramatically in this era we're looking at with the defeat of Assyria in the late 600s, the rise of Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar, his defeat under the Persians and Cyrus the great who outmaneuvered their frenemy, cousins, rivals, the Medes and swept up in this tumultuous moment in history are the Jewish people who did not play all of their cards right. And it was very costly. But now as we've read in the book of Esther, the land has been resting during this period of great global tumult. And God has preserved these people under two different captors in Babylon in captivity. And now he has moved the heart of Cyrus the great to let people go. And as we looked at the last couple of days, they've gone up and they've taken money at the behest of Cyrus at Cyrus gave them and they're on their way back to rebuild things and they're having to sort through questions like who actually is a participant in this grand rebuild that we're going to do. And some people didn't want to go back and rebuild in Jerusalem. Some people wanted to stay back East in Persia because they knew it and they liked it and they'd been there for a generation or two. And in the book of Ezra, we get the impression that the author of Ezra thought the more noble thing was to go and re-colonize land that is your hereditary home from ages past. And that's what we were kind of looking at in chapter one and chapter two of Ezra. We looked at the theme of reversal that there's this God-ordained sovereign reversal of fortune, reversal of fate that is a completion of what God had promised through the prophets. And then we get into chapter three and this is pretty easy to summarize. But what we get here is the statement that when the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled into their towns, the people assembled as one man in Jerusalem, then Jeshua, son of Josodak and his fellow priests and Zerubah-bul, son of Shealtiel, more on him in a minute, and his associates began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it in accordance with what is written in the law of Moses, the man of God. For most of us who are in this conversation, whether Christians or people who are now maybe on the fringes of Christianity, sizing that up, trying to make sense of maybe the religion you were raised with, or people who are agnostic or atheist who are here and we're all having this conversation together, for most of us, we're just not culturally going to resonate with this idea of the centrality of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament properly. Some of you who are in the conversation are of Jewish descent, maybe even more traditional Jewish descent, and you're going to have a little bit more cultural memory and appreciation for how much this is at the heart of things. Remember when we talked about the Mandalorian the other day? The Mandalorians, they have this great forge in the Star Wars universe on their planet of Mandalore, and when the great forge is shut down because they're a warrior cult, so all of their armoring is central to what they do, and without that they lose their identity. Things don't make sense. It's the heartbeat. It's the rhythm of who they are culturally, religiously. And like we talked about the other day, that little Star Wars show is drawing off of this example. It's a metaphor that is based on the example of Hebrew culture, Jewish culture in the ancient world in the sacrificial system. And so it's a very telling detail that basically the first thing the Jewish people did when they got back to the rubble of their old temple was rebuild the altar and resume sacrifices exactly as prescribed in the law of Moses, the quote, man of God. Now you've traveled before you've probably been away from home for a week, a couple weeks, maybe longer and extended period of time. Maybe you studied abroad or something when you're in college. And at some point when you're traveling, you start picturing what it's going to be like to get home. And you probably got something about home that you just love. I mean, whether it's people or rhythm or a certain food or drink, you can only get there. And you start thinking to yourself, what's going to be the first thing I do when I get back? Is it going to be go stretch out on the back porch and see how the plants that I've planted are growing or the leaves coming in? Who knows? Whatever your thing is, you think about what's the first thing I'm going to do? Well, these guys had a long time to think about what's the first thing we're going to do. And the answer was, we've got to resume this thing that is the heartbeat of our culture and our relationship with God so much more importantly. And so it's really encouraging as we get into Ezra chapter three to see that it looks like some lessons have been learned, that this direct descendant of David who would be sitting on the throne if there were still an actual throne here is arubable. He is pointing things in the right direction. He's leading like David would lead pointing things toward the house of God. We have to resume this thing to deal with to a tone for the brokenness of our people. This is how we resolve sin, ultimately under the grace of God. This is how we have communion with God. And so the first thing they do when they get home is they start that stuff. And it's awesome. And it looks like this thing is on the right track. But as is the case so often when we're going through the Old Testament stuff that is promising is followed by stuff that is difficult. And we're going to run into trouble not too much further into Ezra chapter three. And we'll look at that next time around. I say again, I love that this format allows us to go as big picture as we need to go to pinch zoom in on stuff as tightly as we need to do that to understand things. More or less the problem that we're trying to solve together is hey, we'd like to understand a part of the Bible and that might come with some challenges. The solution is well, let's just do what it takes to try to understand that part of the Bible better and we got time. Thanks for going along on that journey with me. Thanks for being down with that kind of a pace. And we'll push forward in Ezra three next time around. And Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again.
