These my name is Matt Whitman. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and I would like to make a historical assertion. And then I want you to tell me who I'm talking about. Okay, right? Here we go. I think when you look at US history, the Johnson presidency makes it clear just how long a shadow and assassination casts over the next administration. All right, understanding that not everybody's from the United States. And even those of us who are maybe not everybody's a huge fan of US history, I'm still going to pose this question to you wherever you are right now, especially if you were on a treadmill at a workout club on the count of three. I want you to shriek as loud as you can who it is that I'm referencing as president Johnson, whose administration was affected by an assassination. Ready? Three, two, one, go. Hey, wait a darn second there, pal. I heard you on the first treadmill at the workout club, shriek, Lyndon Baines Johnson. And you're absolutely right. But then I heard somebody five treadmills down shriek, Andrew Johnson. And that lady also could be absolutely right. So who was I actually talking about? I don't, I don't know who I was actually talking about. I tried to pick something that would be ambiguous to illustrate the point. I think maybe I've even used that one before, but you get what I'm driving at, right? A thousand years from now, if somehow people are like, I haven't had podcast was very important. We need to dig deep into that to figure out that guy meant by that. It would be ambiguous and it would be difficult to figure out which president Johnson I was just referring to. Likewise, when we look at this verse in Matthew 23, verse 35, we run into the same kind of historical ambiguity. It does cause confusion and even some friction like you are no doubt feeling right now with that person at the club who shrieked the wrong Johnson. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth from the blood of righteous able to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barakiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. While I believe, as I argued yesterday, that the meaning of Jesus statement was crystal clear to everybody who was standing there in the original audience, I would have to also bet that there were a whole lot of people in that original audience who were like, yeah, I get exactly what you mean, Jesus. Also, which Zechariah, because aren't there like 30 some in our scriptures? And indeed, I think it is like almost 30 different Zechariah's appear in the Old Testament. And some of them are even somewhat ambiguous in terms of having overlapping names of parents or grandparents, which is wildly confusing, far more confusing than LBJ and Andrew Johnson, both having been president of the United States of America. And my guess is that the readers of the gospels as they first went into circulation were even more confused because Matthew records Jesus as saying, Zechariah, son of Barakiah, but Luke in chapter should have written it down. So, I'm just, second, I'm flipping. I want you to know how long it takes to find things like this. No, no, no. Yep, there we go. End of 11. From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. So Luke doesn't record Jesus saying that Zechariah is descended from anybody in particular. And all of this gets even more confusing and maybe even high stakes as it possibly strikes to the heart of the reliability of the gospels because this Zechariah son of Barakiah doesn't look like that's the one who is in view in the second Chronicles chapter 24. It looks like that's the Zechariah who is responsible for the book of Zechariah right near the end of what we call the Old Testament. Zechariah chapter one verse one says in the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Barakiah, the son of Ido. And then the rest of that book of Zechariah goes on to be super, super messianic. So some people might look at that and say, okay, well, the prophetic book of Zechariah, which was written somewhere in the 500s BC, one of the last books of the Old Testament to be written chronologically, since that book is so Messiah heavy, maybe that's exactly who Jesus is referencing in Matthew chapter 23, because everybody in their brains would have associated that Zechariah son of Barakiah son of Ido with the Messiah. And so then Jesus remarks would be framed as your spiritual intellectual tradition is guilty of all the blood dating clear back to Abel and all the way up to the prophet Zechariah who was prophesying about me. So if you rejected him, it would make sense that you reject me also. But again, we run into that problem of second Chronicles chapter 20 is describing like a completely different era in the history of all of this. I said second Chronicles 20, second Chronicles 24. Why did I just, I mean, I could have just bookmarked that it would have made everybody's lives better. And now I'm first Chronicles 24. Here it is. This is what it actually says starting in verse 20. Then the spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoia. Oh, I was different than the other Zechariah, the priest. He stood before the people and said, this is what God says. Why do you disobey the Lord's commands? He will not prosper because you have forsaken the Lord. He has forsaken you. It sounds like the message of John the Baptist or Jesus himself. You brood of vipers. You guys are completely missing the point. But verse 21, they plotted against him and by order of the king, they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lord's temple. Oh, well, working with the king, these religious leaders have somebody killed in a very public dramatic way who had called them out. That sounds a little bit John the Baptist. And he was just referenced a couple of verses ago. Verse 22, King Joash did not remember the kind of Zechariah's father, Jehoia, had shown him but killed his son who said as he lay dying, may the Lord see this and call you to account, meaning that in second Chronicles 24, in this instance, you've got this curse is too strong a word. This narrative arc that is still hanging out there that needs to be finished. There's this call for accountability and this is a righteous person who speaks on account of God according to the text. And he said, this ain't done. There is an accountability that still is to come. And then we get to chapter 23 of Matthew and Jesus says, and so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth. So given the geography of Jesus remarks murdered between the temple and the altar, which squares perfectly with second Chronicles 24 and given the imprecative remarks that Zechariah calls out and the narrative arc that runs out into the future, begs for justice and for completion, it looks like pretty clearly this must be who Jesus has in view. Well, then why is he saying it's the son of Barakiah who comes along clearly hundreds of years later and there's just no way to go back and be like, well, you know, maybe the second Chronicles 24 Zechariah, maybe Barakiah was also his dad. I mean, okay, I take that back. Maybe it's the same kind of thing where there's like a grandfather or the guy went by two different names, but it doesn't look like that. And this is usually the place where I relieve the tension by being like, okay, well, in the same way that it's pretty easy with one or two more context clues to figure out which President Johnson I'm talking about. So it's pretty easy to sort this one out if we look at one or two more context clues. But I'm not going to say that here. We're doing this whole Matthew project with eyes wide open, which means that we don't get to take cheap little shortcuts to feel better or to relieve tensions. It means we have to dive deep into the questions or else should you be a person of faith in Christ or someone who becomes that you might end up with this little nagging voice in the back of your head that's like, yeah, all of that makes sense and it all holds together. But what about that one verse in the Zechariah thing? Did Jesus screw up? Did Matthew screw up? And while we might not ultimately get final and satisfactory answers for everything about this 2000 year old document we're looking at that can't come as a result of just abject laziness if we're here and we're aware of the issue. We got to look at it closely and it's going to take me two episodes to get through that. So we'll dig deeper next time around not with the objective messing with people or being disruptive or trying to discredit the Bible, but instead with the objective of being honest with ourselves, honest with what we have in front of us and doing eyes wide open faith if indeed we are going to do faith at all. More on the possible explanations for the frictions this passage presents next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
