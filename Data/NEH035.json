So people want to come here, but the result isn't if you happen to live here, you can go to other really neat places for really cheap, and I like going to neat places and meeting people and seeing cool things. And so I have used Rapid City because of the ease of air travel from here as something of a launching point to get me into seemingly distant locations, but that are actually very accessible from this location. Likewise, that's what we're doing with Ezra and Nehemiah Endester. I don't know if I've completely spelled this out yet, but you're smart, you see what's going on. I don't want to go and do one straight walkthrough of the entire Old Testament all at once over the course of 15 years of podcast. I want to jump around a little bit and I want to get back to the New Testament soon because there's more stuff there that I want to go and look at and think about. But we got to strengthen the base. We got to go and dive deeper into the Old Testament stuff before we go and do New Testament stuff. And so when we got done with season one of this podcast, which was massive, 800 episodes on the Book of Matthew, I thought to myself, okay, well, let's do the one book per day kind of survey thing that'll strengthen our base of operations here. I don't want to go to the next season, but I don't want to go to the next season. I don't want to go to the next season. I don't want to go to the next season. I don't want to go to the next season. I don't want to go to the next season. I don't want to go to the next season. I don't want to go to the next season. I don't want to go to the next season. Technically, I live in this one little place, but that airport facilitates travel all over. Technically, we're in Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther over the last couple of seasons. But these books chronologically are happening at the end of the Old Testament. And so all the storylines and story arcs of the whole Old Testament come forward into these books. And we can use them as a launching point, both to understand the setup for the New Testament and when we get Jesus on the scene and all of that. But also we can use them to bounce all over the place, like a good quality, fast service regional airport, into the Old Testament to get all of these stories and understand better all of these little important details that undergird the grand historical redemptive narrative of everything. So I love opportunities like what we're being presented in Nehemiah 1 with Nehemiah's prayer because it allows us to go and dip into something quickly that is really important to our larger understanding. But yesterday, we're looking at Nehemiah's prayer and he's quoting stuff God said a long, long time ago, back to God. It looks like Nehemiah is trying to activate a clause, a promise that God has said he would deliver on. God said in Deuteronomy 30, if your hearts get right, even if it seems like things are totally broken years from now, things are totally wrecked. Big paraphrases mind. This is just if your hearts get right. Yeah, I'll fix things. I'll reconnect you with this land that is connected to my relationship with you. I will do that even if things seem really busted up. So the first part of Nehemiah's prayer is him saying, here's how my heart is. It is like how you said you would want our hearts to be if we were truly repentant and wanted to be right with you even after great calamity and many years of getting it wrong. That's how my heart is. And I think implicitly, please help my heart to be more that way and all of our hearts to be that way. And then part number two of his prayer is, and in keeping with our hearts being that way, would you do the thing that you said you would do and solidify this repatriation, this restoration that you have been chipping away at here over the last hundred years. Let us get to the finish line in rebuilding the people and rebuilding the physical place as well. And you got to understand that the way this is phrased, remember the instruction you gave your servant to Moses saying, that's Nehemiah 1, 8 in the middle of this prayer. Remember, this isn't like some kind of thing where crazy Bible scholars are like, well, I think maybe this is evocative of this or if you look really closely at the way he phrased it in the original Hebrew, it could be an odd to this other. No, no, no, no, no. He says exactly what he's referencing. Remember that promise you made to Moses and these were the exact words of it. Remember that one? So we know exactly what he's pointing to. And it is Deuteronomy 30 as I did not know off the top of my head and discovered along with you yesterday. But that is not the only time in the Old Testament that that clause is brought up by God. In second chronicles, really the first seven, hang on. Yeah, really about the first seven chapters of second chronicles are an account of the early reign of King Solomon, the son of great King David, and Solomon's building and dedication of the temple. Now, if you're thinking, isn't the dedication to temple stuff, isn't that in a different book of the Bible? What are you talking about? Well, we're both right because this story gets told two separate times. So this is kind of the way you got to remember it in big sweeping terms. The first second Samuel gives you a whole lot about David's early life and David as king, the ups and downs of all of it. Then when you turn from the double book of the Samuels to the double book of the kings, you jump from David's stuff to Solomon's stuff. And so early in first kings, you get a very similar account of the building of the temple, the preparation of that, the dedication of the temple. And then the double book of kings, first and second kings, ends with the calamity, the deportation by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians that we talk about all the time in 586 BC. That deportation is where we leave off the second kings. So the double book of Samuel, think of David, the double book of kings starts with Solomon, but then it covers all of these big and little mostly calamitous reigns that lead to a calamitous failure and the curses described in the Mosaic covenant coming to pass. But then you turn the page to the next double book of the Old Testament, first and second chronicles, and you start all the way over. That can be a little disorienting at first, but it looks like first and second chronicles is a big picture overview, maybe slash some would say likely even written by Ezra himself as a huge big picture overview with really a pretty positive outlook of the whole relationship between God's chosen people and God and all of it. So it's a recounting of the whole grand thing. So first chronicles takes you through the entire history of the Old Testament up until the end of the life of David, and then it neatly divides with second chronicles opening with the life of Solomon. And then as I said, the first, what did I say, eight chapters? How quickly we forget. Seven chapters of second chronicles takes us through the early reign of Solomon and the dedication of the temple. And Nehemiah's prayer regarding that clause about God repatriating his people and all of that is a reference back to this as well. Why? Well, because Solomon takes great care in using all of the wealth and riches and influence that have been gained during his kingdom to go and build this amazing temple, just like God told his father David was going to happen through his own Solomon. And so the temple gets built is nuts. The description of this is just beautiful. It's one of the real high points in the entire history of the Old Testament narrative. All of this is happening 600ish years before Nehemiah's life and events. In chapter five, we get into the dedication of the temple. The Ark of the Covenant is there. Solomon speaks to the people and recounts a bunch of the big picture stuff that we're always talking about, the big through line narrative of the whole story, the God and his people in the redemptive plan in the Old Testament. And then Solomon turns and prays to God and it's really good. This is one of the wonderful prayers of the Bible. I don't think any of them are particularly awful, but this is amazing. It's a whole double page spread on my Bible. And he's praying for something that sort of also Nehemiah is praying for in Nehemiah chapter one. Solomon is praying for these blessings of God and steadfastness of God and for him to remember his people during very good times. Nehemiah's prayer echoes a lot of this language, but during very bad times. Both of these prayers highlight the theme of God being one who keeps his promises and remembers for a very long time. Solomon even specifically uses the same language Nehemiah does in verse 40 about God being aware of them. Now, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. And again, Nehemiah 1-6, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. Solomon is praying this at the newly dedicated temple. Nehemiah is praying this in exile. So there's some real cemeteries, some real echoes here that are pretty cool. In chapter seven, God's glory physically shows up and fills the temple, fire and smoke. It's inarguable to all of the witnesses who are there that this happened and that God is indeed present. And then God speaks to Solomon. And tomorrow we're going to look at exactly what God said to Solomon after all of these amazing events and this incredible dedication and the initiation of a building that has a legacy that would last far, far longer than the 35th Street Burger King in Greeley, Colorado. We'll go and we'll look carefully at those words from God in 2 Chronicles 7 and consider what Nehemiah is making of those in his prayer in chapter one. And again, all of that tomorrow. Alright, I'm Matt. This is The 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
