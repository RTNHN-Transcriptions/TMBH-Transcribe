we're kind of this cool little pivot point here as we're going through this season on the book of Galatians we're right in between the end of chapter two in the beginning of chapter three really verse one of chapter three and i've been using this verse that says you foolish Galatians who has bewitched you before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified i've been using this verse as an excuse to go and look at what smarter people than me have to say about the situation that's unfolding here in the book of Galatians about who these people are about what mistake it is that they've made i mean why are they foolish what does it mean that you were bewitched are they responsible for forgetting the gospel message they received and chasing after something that is no gospel at all or is it something that just happened to them then they got put under a spell or an enchantment well i am far from the first person in the history of christianity to be obsessed with the book of Galatians both because of the implications of the book for understanding the whole new testament but also because of the implications for me and my own walk with god my own trying to figure this stuff out whole but just tons of other people have thought about this book very deeply and written about some of the greatest minds in the history of the church and over the last few days we've been going down this fun rabbit hole of seeing what many of those brilliant minds from across the centuries have done with this question of what's going on here in Galatians and what is Paul calling out on the part of these people so we've looked at Charles Spurgeon Martin Luther John Calvin and today we are going to go east and much further back in time where we are going to hear from John Chrysostom the archbishop of Constantinople he was in charge in the late 300s and early 400s the leading voice of christianity in the eastern mediterranean greek speaking world and he wrote a commentary on the epistle to the Galatians and so i went looked up what he had to say about the passage we're looking at Galatians 3 verse 1 he says this let not Paul calling the Galatians foolish surprise you for it's not a transgression of christ's command not to call one's brother of fool but rather a strict observance of it whoa well he took that in a really interesting direction didn't he i didn't even think about that you foolish Galatians but remember Jesus said that you're not supposed to call people fool where is that it's in the sermon on the mount right in a second second i brought a bible in case something like this happened we're learning together in real times now we do things it is hatred murder yeah here it is is Jesus talking about yeah you've heard it said but i tell you it's in the middle of those uh Matthew 5 21 you've heard that it was said to people long ago do not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment but i tell you that anyone who's angry with his brother will be subject to judgment again anyone who says to his brother raka is answerable to the Sanhedrin i don't know exactly what that word means but it apparently is really mean it's Aramaic is answerable to the Sanhedrin but anyone who says you fool will be in danger of the fire of hell it is crazy that we've been lingering on this verse for a week and it never even crossed my mind until i've read john chris system right now to you that this would actually be an issue or attention i mean legitimately saying you foolish Galatians i don't know seems like it's a little gentler and a little more paternalistic here on the part of paul i think it's meant as an exhortation i don't know let's see how john chris system sorts it out if he tries to get paul off the hook here let now paul calling the Galatians foolish surprise you for it's not a transgression of christ's command not to call one's brother of fool but rather strict observance of it for it's not said simply whoever shall say to his brother you fool but whoever shall do so without a cause ah so chris system is saying that jesus is talking about just flippant cruelty and hatred not just the use of the word itself uh he goes on and who more fittingly than the Galatians could be called a fool who after so great events adhered to past things as if nothing else had ever happened if on this account paul had to be called a reviler peter may likewise on account of ananias and sapphira be called a homicide oh wow he's getting so deep into all the different new testament stories here this is complex but as it would be wildness to do so in that case much more in this so his point is it was god's righteous judgment against ananias and sapphira in the book of acts that caused them to be killed when they lied to the holy spirit and tried to wreck the early church that was in peter's fault that was god's judgment so chris system is saying here that it's god's judgment against the Galatians that they're being called foolish because indeed they are being foolish this isn't a statement of hatred it's a statement of correction okay let's see what he's doing cool i hadn't even like i said thought about that tension but let's get to the witchcraft stuff and the big guilement and all of that what do we have next here okay he goes on for after he had shown that they had rejected the faith and made the death of christ to be without a purpose paul introduces his reproof which even as it is is less severe than what they deserved note how paul doesn't say who has seduced you or who has perverted you or who has philosophized you but rather who hath cast an envious eye on you oh interesting chris system who is more of a practitioner of the greek in the eastern world he's digging deep into that word that paul uses here about bewitching and getting way down to the core of it which is this idea of an evil eye or almost like possession that can happen by like this old ancient pagan greek notion of making eye contact with the evil spirit or allowing it in almost how people in the middle ages or i guess later than the middle ages the rumors about vampires you remember this like they can't come into your house unless you willfully let them in if they seduce you and let them in then the vampire can come in that that concept of being bewitched and staring down the evil until eventually your guard goes down and you let the evil in voluntarily wasn't a new concept invented by bram stoker when he wrote dracula that's tapping into very old ideas about the relationship between beguiled people and the evil and the act of the individual being bewitched or allowing or participating with a bewitching by opening their eyes to it and in doing so welcoming it in and even jesus seems to acknowledge this idea is still in the sermon on the mountain matthew chapter six when he's talking about the eyes being the lamp of the body and if your eyes are good then your whole body will be full of light and then conversely if your eyes are bad your eye your body will be full of darkness i think that's the same kind of stuff that chris system is drawing on here and that old legends drew on and so he's kind of painting a picture of these Galatians being like deer in the headlights staring into the thing getting the kind of swirly eyes like what was the name of the snake kah in the jungle book you can remember the animated jungle book you can make the swirly eyes and then your eyes would start to swirl and then you get all enchanted and things would happen i mean it's kind of that image that chris system is painting here and he's pointing out paul didn't say the Galatians got seduced or perverted or out philosophized he's saying they got bewitched envious eyed and then chris system tips his hand that and paul is kind of taking it easy on them in this regard chris system rights thus paul is tempering his reprimand with somewhat of praise because it implies that their previous actions had excited jealousy and that the present occurrence arose from the malignity of a demon whose breath had blasted their prosperous estate oh what an interesting read he's saying they did so well that they put a target on their back for these malicious spiritual forces who wanted to come and do damage to them this is a very sophisticated interaction with the text that we're getting from chris system that i did not see coming well that was fun all right just a couple more little quick ones here and then we need to be done with this exercise and move forward with Galatians three theodorate of syrus this is not syrus like syrus the great this is a town in seria that was founded by one of alexander's generals it would have been general salusus so this is a guy who was associated with anti-ak his maybe parents i looked this up i knew this once either he or his parents had some kind of blindness malady that was cured so this is a dude who's writing in the four hundreds who has kind of a lot in common with the apostle paul in that regard connections with anti-ak blindness and healing and all of that and he has just a little remark that's been preserved here about Galatians three one he writes the way paul frames things here in Galatians chapter one quote indicates the Galatians previous zeal for piety and manifests the fatherly affection of the apostle paul he grieves over them for their loss of i like this phrase wealth accumulated theodorate reads it and he's like he had something special and you gave it away for nothing you traded an amazing inheritance for a garbage inheritance it's just sad that you made such a bad deal that you got taken advantage of and that you were so foolish i thought that was an interesting way to phrase that from this less well-known church father from way back in the day finally i went and found a brief remark here from saint gerome the guy who translated the scriptures into latin he's the dude behind the vulgate he's an interesting character because he's a saint in the catholic church and sometimes catholics really like the stuff that gerome says other times they're like uh you know that there's friction there between him and the church but no matter what you make of gerome i mean he's a guy who spent a lot of time around the bible thinking about this stuff and here's what he had to say about Galatians three one and the whole enterprise of what's going on here in the book of Galatians and what this conversation is gerome writes we have to expound this quote from paul quote who has bewitched you in a way that is worthy of paul who even if he can be rough in his speech is not so in his understanding it must not be interpreted in such a way as to make paul legitimize the witchcraft that is popularly supposed to do harm rather he's used a colloquial expression and as elsewhere so here he's adopted a word from everyday speech in the same way as tender infants are said to be harmed by witchcraft so too the Galatians recently born in the faith of christ and nourished with the milk not solid food have been injured as though someone has cast a spell on them interesting so gerome is saying this was inflicted on the Galatians primarily he'd used them as victims of what these outsiders these interlopers did to them but he would also say that they weren't truly beguiled or bewitched gerome is very cautious he doesn't like the idea of paul legitimizing that power in any way so he kind of wants to retreat from that and be like hey paul's just using an expression here i've enjoyed these last few days i think this has been fruitful i know it's different than what we normally do but it seemed in order because i genuinely didn't know what to make the word bewitched here and just going and looking up the original greek didn't answer the question for me and i wanted to get a better sense of his paul really saying somebody did a thing to you and therefore maybe you don't totally have culpability or is he using an expression here and saying no this is disobedience you disobeyed god by rejecting this thing that you were given that is true and exchanging it for this false thing that these false apostles brought to you in the end i think i'm with the ancient scholars who say it's kind of both something did happen to them they were acted upon i really appreciate chris system's remarks that part of the reason they got subjected to this test is because they initially had done so well there's kind of a compliment in there but clearly they did not pass the test when the pressure got turned up and now paul is coming to sort things back out whether he literally means they were bewitched or not i suppose i'm coming to the conclusion is irrelevant either way something was done to them and they have ownership of what happened here they're morally culpable and the people who did it to them are morally culpable also as we're going to read as we go along this is correctable so we probably aren't going to need to linger too much longer into Galatians on what they got wrong and then we'll be ready to make the pivot into how to get it right from a firm historical biblical theological foundation this fun i would love to hear your thoughts on it i would love to hear which of these thinkers we've read from over the last few days that you may be resonated with the most and if you would be okay with me ever doing a jaunt like this again because again i know it was a little bit different all right that's a lot today we'll wrap it up there we'll keep moving forward in Galatians 3 next time around i'm matt this is the 10 minute bible hour podcast let's do this again soon", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": "
