And right now we're talking about Galatians. My family and I have all of these cutting boards that we hang on the wall of our kitchen. And they're all the places that we have lived together as a family because we've moved around a little bit for school, work and things like that. And this is fun to acknowledge that all of these places have a piece of our heart, a place where we spent a good chunk of our time together. But there's one place that we have not technically lived that we also have a wooden cutting board of. And that is the state of Alabama. We've been in Alabama a lot because we have great friends there. But Alabama, we felt like it deserved a place on the wall because it's sort of a home away from home. We like the culture there and we even have a church there that we love a great church that we go to whenever we're there in Northern Alabama. So Northern Alabama is kind of our adopted home away from home as a family. Maybe you have one of those as well. Well, I can tell you who definitely had one of those and that is the Apostle Paul. Now, maybe he had a few because dudes from Tarsus and somebody asked a really good question the other day, by the way, about Tarsus. They were asking whether Tarsus was in Galatia. And I think no, I think Tarsus is in Solisia. I think it's a little bit further east, like toward the extreme northeast corner of the Mediterranean Sea. Galatia is more center cut turkey. But yeah, Tarsus is kind of around Galatia. Maybe there's some cultural similarities, but Paul's home home was Tarsus. And then his school home was Jerusalem. I suppose he worked out of there for a while. But then when he had his transitional moment and everything after that on the road to Damascus, after that, it seems like he maybe has a home away from home in Antioch or maybe that just counts as a home home. I mean, he kind of lived in Antioch. He had great affection clearly for the people in Ephesus. But there's one other place that I think was a home away from home for him. And I think it was Galatia. I think it was all those towns around the middle of the province of Galatia. I think that always stuck with him. I think it always had a special place in his heart because as you read through the rest of the book of Acts, one of the things that you discover is that those are the places that he went on every single one of his trips. Now, on the first missionary journey, the prove it deal we've been talking about around here, he hung out there for a long time. In fact, pretty much the whole journey was there. He started on Cyprus. He met the governor there, Surgius Paulus. There's some smart people who think that maybe those guys really hit it off. Paul was even in some ways treated as an adoptive member of Surgius Paulus's household. That household was headquartered in Pecidian Antioch on the mainland. Maybe that's why Paul kept making trips there. Maybe that's why Paul even started going by Paul more regularly than Saul. Maybe that's just a bunch of hokom. But what I can say is this, Paul hung out there an awful lot in the old stomping grounds of Surgius Paulus and his family. He hung out right there around the pinch point in the middle of the hourglass, on the southern half of the hourglass of the province of Galatia, Lystra, Derby, Iconium, Pecidian Antioch. Every trip he goes through these places. Now, on the second missionary journey, which is no longer a prove it deal, now he's playing on the negotiated contract and he's off with the full blessing of the organization. Here, we don't get a lot of details about those particular stops, but the first stops on the journey are to go back to these places where there would be fledgling churches that Paul had just started up. And again, on the beginning of the second journey, Paul picks up Timothy early on in the journey at Lystra. And apparently Timothy's been under all kinds of pressure from some of these Jewish Christian-ish type folks who are like, you got to circumcise this guy or else he's not really a Christian because he's a Gentile or half Gentile. Something's got to be done about that. So this issue, it might seem so trite and distant to you and me, but this was a real life on the ground issue for people all around the ancient world as it became exposed to Christianity. But particularly, it seems like this was just always a hot button issue in Galatia in particular, in Lystra, Derby, Iconium, and Piscity and Antioch. Well, once again, we don't get a lot of details on that second missionary journey about the stuff that happens in Galatia. The story quickly moves into mainland Greece and then even all the way down to Athens and Corinth, like old school Persian wars, hold the line boys, we're going to fight off Xerxes and the Persians kind of Greece. And there's some amazing stuff that happens on this journey in Philippi and Thessalonica, stories that you've definitely heard before that I totally want to dive all the way into, but I'm not going to. There's an amazing account of Paul going to Athens in here as well. I've been to the place where this scene happens. I've put feet on the rocks where this story happened where Paul stood. And this is a very interesting little detail because Paul is now totally outside the Jewish bubble. And he's trying to explain Jesus' the Messiah and the idea of God is kind of the first mover. It almost sounds like he's adopting or trying on some of the language of Aristotle, the tutor of Alexander the Great who'd been dead for 350, 400 years by the time Paul is there in Athens. He gives us famous men of Athens speech and the Athenians, they kind of think they're the center of the world so most of them are like, okay, whatever, that's interesting. But a few people even sign up after that. So now you've got a little church maybe in Athens or at least a few Christians hanging out. He goes on to Corinth. Corinth is a fascinating town, a pretty debauched town, but things that are successful happen there as well. Then he comes back, he goes out again on his third missionary journey. Now we're into Acts the end of 18 and 19 and forward. And then this trip sees him again start off going to Derby, Listeri, Coneum, Antioch, and Pecidia. And then he makes more or less the same big loop through a lot of those cities where incredible things happen before, makes his way back to Corinth. This is probably the longest missionary journey that he goes on. And then he goes back to Jerusalem as we get toward the end of Acts and he's like, all right, we got to go settle up with my old classmates. And even though people right at the end of that third journey are begging Paul not to go, don't do it, man, they're going to kill you. I'm telling you, they're not going to listen to you. They're going to kill you. They're begging him. Paul is still like, nah, I got to go. So in the same way that the dividing line of the narrative in the gospel of Luke is when Luke says, then Jesus said his face resolutely toward Jerusalem and the rest of the story follows Jesus going there, even though he knows what's coming for him when he gets to Jerusalem. So the sequel to the gospel of Luke, that being the book of Acts does the same thing. The pivots on Paul saying, all right, this has been great. These missionary journeys are awesome, but I got to go into the lions, Dan. I got to go to Jerusalem. I got to go face down my old classmates and I'm going to try to persuade them that this Jesus thing is real and that life in Christ, life in God has come to the Gentiles. And we're going to try it. And everybody begs him not to go. And as I told you a minute ago, he goes anyway. Sure enough, he gets arrested. He rots in a Roman cell and Caesarea, Maritima up the road about an hour from Jerusalem. Then he makes one more journey here in the book of Acts and that is against his will. I mean, maybe he could say that. Maybe he kind of actually wanted to go on this journey in a weird way, but he goes as a prisoner by boat on a journey to Rome. He could shipwrecked along the way. I mean, just the prisoner transfer part of the narrative is incredible in and of itself. He makes his way to Rome. And when the book of Acts ends, Paul is under house arrest there in Rome. Now, probably there were two eras of imprisonment during Paul's life in Rome. One is an apartment that is still visible under a nondescript church in the middle of a shopping district in Rome. You'd never think to go there and find a place where the apostle Paul lived and worked and probably wrote letters out of. But there it is. It's still down there. And then the second arrest was probably in the Mamertine prison, which is at the far end of the forum and can be accessed by kind of coming in around the side of the forum over by the beautiful church of Santa Maria in Arachella. Arachella, is that what they call it? I don't remember. My Italian is completely failing me here. And then across the street from the market of Trajan, Trajan's Market. So you can sneak in there. There's just tiny little building. It's a Mamertine prison. You can go down in there and Paul almost surely wrote 2 Timothy at least from that cell that has been preserved all the way to this day. So the book of Acts ends with the gospel having gone to the ends of the earth, just like Jesus said to do all the way back at the beginning in Acts chapter 1 verse 8. The disciples, I mean round one of the disciples, the original, the old school disciples are all like, okay, this is amazing. But are we going to have a reckoning for all the people and everything they did? Are we going to sort all this out now? And Jesus is like, nope, it's not up to you to know that. Instead, you're going to be my witnesses to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. Very early on, we do the Jerusalem round of this story as a part of the A plot. Then we do the Judea part of the story as part of the A plot. But then we meet Saul and pick up the B plot of the book of Acts. And gradually that A plot surrounding Jerusalem and Judea diminishes and the B plot, which centers a whole lot around Paul, takes us out quickly past Samaria. And then we spend a ton of the book out at the ends of the earth where we see the same kind of miraculous patterns being repeated again and again. We see the same kind of miraculous confirmation that the gospel, the message of Jesus, was always for everyone. Jews and Gentiles alike, Jesus is the fulfillment, the completion of the law, and the prophets, and the Old Testament. And now this new family of faith, it includes the unlikeliest of people. It would be weird if the book of Acts and the rest of the Bible didn't give us any account of that tension. I mean, that would be weird and not believable. You really expect me to believe that you have this much Old Testament. Listen to it. Oh, there it is. Okay, just a second. I'm not even close to that. Listen that much. Well, just still flipping that much Old Testament. I'm only a Psalm. So I'm going backwards still. Second Kings, judges, Deuteronomy, number X, Genesis, introductory thing, and then the cardboard. There's that much Old Testament. Who in their right mind would expect us as readers to go through all of that and then get to the book of Acts and be like, and then everybody was just fine and happy. And there was no problem. And everybody was like, that's great. I believe it super. This isn't even difficult for me nonsense. This is a tension that absolutely had to exist. And it is explored deeply and the Bible doesn't shy away from it and Paul doesn't shy away from it. And indeed, Paul is kind of the embodiment of this problem as he goes through his journey of faith and life and on these missionary journeys. He was the hardcore fundamentalist who was committed to all of the Old Testament stuff and committed to God, but wrongheadedly. And he is the guy who is then softened by the truth of it and comes around to see what it is. And he goes from being the chief advocate against this stuff to the chief advocate for it. He is both a Jew and a Roman citizen. His protege has a Jewish parent and a Greek parent. Paul plants churches that have a bunch of Jewish people in them, but also a bunch of Gentiles in them. And through all of these adventures as a Christian on these missionary journeys and everywhere else, he seems to have really loved Ephesus, but his home away from home, the place that he had to make sure to stop every single time on every single missionary journey, are these little towns in the middle of the hourglass shaped province of Galatia. And I think whether we pinch zoom in on this little part of Galatia or that little part of Galatia and say, okay, I think that's probably specifically who he was talking to in the book of Galatians, either way, that tremendous affection for these oft-visited churches that he founded very early on in his career. I think that affection never waned. And I think we're going to see that come through in the book of Galatians, which we're going to start on tomorrow. I'm Matt.
