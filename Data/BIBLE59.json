    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about James. The book of James is a letter written by James almost surely. This is the James who is the half-brother of Jesus, and this letter is written to Jewish Christians scattered all over the place in general. Unlike the letters we got from Paul, this letter is not addressed specifically to a church that is going through a certain set of circumstances, and it's not addressed to some kind of partner in ministry on a personal level. This is a general letter, and indeed that's the nickname that has been used for all of the remaining letters of the New Testament. These are general letters or general epistles that are just directed at a wide, wide audience of Christians dealing with big topics that lots of people would have been asking about. The book of James in particular is directed toward Jewish Christians who are scattered all about, and we know that because at the beginning it says, James, a servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes scattered among the nations in this opening chapter, we figure out pretty quickly that he's writing a very practical book that is meant to give direction to Jewish Christians like James who were struggling with the transition from thinking in second temple period, old Jewish failed paradigm categories to thinking in terms of the New Covenant, the kingdom categories, this new paradigm of what it is to be a Jewish Christian, a Jewish follower of Christ. Now James would be an expert in the difficulties of that transition and an expert in anticipating the questions people would have because he wasn't initially convinced that Jesus was the Messiah. There's a bunch of stuff throughout the New Testament that indicates that Jesus' whole family dragged their feet a little bit. Looks like at least on one occasion they felt like maybe he was getting in over his head and they needed to come and rescue him and they wouldn't even come in to a talk that he was giving instead they stood outside and sent messages in to be like, we need to talk to you, we need to retrieve you. And that's where Jesus gives us that really famous statement at the end of Matthew 12 where he's like, who is my mother, brother, family? I tell you, it's the people who do the will of my father in heaven. Wow, what a bold statement Jesus makes there, both stiff-arming his own family, including his brother James's attempt to reign him in, but also pointing out that this new family of faith is a real thing. It was quite the seizing of the opportunity that the circumstances presented there on the part of Jesus in Matthew 12. Well, somewhere later on James does come around and he emerges as the leader of the Jerusalem Church as the other disciples go out to the ends of the earth and spread the gospel in the various ways they do and all meet their grisly, violent fates that they run into. Everybody except John dies prematurely and in a murderous fashion for what they're teaching about Jesus. And James is no exception. He emerges as the leader of the Jerusalem Church. He's the guy in Acts chapter 15 when their disputes getting stirred up between the Judaizer types who want the Gentile Christians all throughout the world to act just like them. And the Gentile Christians were like, I don't know about that. Well, it's James who makes peace and stands in the middle is like, no, we can't put that on them. Instead, here is three basic expectations that we can all agree upon for what it looks like to be a Christian as it pertains to these questions. James is also a guy who was profoundly pastoral. He clearly wanted to help people make sense of their faith in Christ and make sense of what their lives looked like, especially in difficult times and difficult times is pretty much all James knew as the leader of the church in Jerusalem. You'll recall that Paul in his letters is always talking about having to take up this offering. The offering is for the people in Jerusalem because the Christians there were on very difficult times. There was a famine and the other churches around the Mediterranean world were able to prop them up during that time. But also there was all kinds of persecution during that time. We look back at history and we think about all the Roman persecution that happened in the first few centuries of Christianity. And indeed, there's a lot of that kind of stuff we've talked about in our conversations. But the first persecutors of the church weren't the Romans. They were the Jews who didn't believe Jesus was the Messiah and felt that Jesus was a threat to their standing and their position and their power. And so James and the early Jerusalem Jewish Christians, they were up against that kind of stuff all the time. And finally that boiled over during an exchange, a handoff of power between Roman governors. Nobody was paying attention very briefly in the early 60s AD. And we've got accounts that James dies in an imaginative, multifaceted, violent way that involved being shoved off of some high area on the temple and then being hit with rocks and then finally done in with a Fuller's cudgel. You know, like somebody who cleans fancy rugs and stuff by beating it with that heavy stick. That's the thing that the history tells us finally did in James. He died very ugly, but James's reputation, his nickname was James the just or James the old camel need because they said that he used to go and pray on his knees until he wore them out and tore them up, pleading with God for the forgiveness of his fellow countrymen, his fellow Jewish brothers and sisters for what they had done in rejecting Christ and in seeking Christ executed. It's no surprise then that he's going to lean into the stuff that ends up being recorded in the gospel of Matthew, which is the most Jewish of the four gospels. And there's a ton of stuff in James's very practical book of New Testament wisdom here that looks like it's drawn directly from the teachings of Christ as recorded in the book of Matthew. Well, Jesus said in more than one way, if you love me, you'll keep my commands. And James right out of the gate says effectively the same thing. It's not enough to just hear what God says. You got to do what God says. And James seems to be again making peace and speaking with brevity and clarity to say, I'm going to speak to roughly a dozen of the key issues that seem to be plaguing Jewish Christians in the early going and give you wisdom on what it looks like to put your faith into action and to obey and identify with Jesus with your deeds. So he talks about things like how to use money and the way money can create pride and the way money can cause you to focus on living in the now, but he encourages that expectant living that we also see Paul encouraging the people he's writing to. He insists on integrity and truth telling. He challenges his readers to familiarize themselves and remind themselves of their own mortality and the fleetingness of life so that they'll be oriented the right way toward what's going on around them and oriented the right way toward God. He talks about avoiding favoritism in church because some people are fancier or richer or people of greater influences. That's not in keeping with the values of the kingdom or how this family of faith works. He also talks at length about claiming to believe in Jesus without kingdom value actions that undergird all of that or that grow out of all of that. And he says very explicitly that faith without works is dead. Your faith isn't real. If it isn't producing some kind of fruit, if it isn't producing anything. And also James talks a ton about the tongue and how what we say using our tongues, using our mouths reveals things about what's really going on at the deepest level of our hearts. It reveals whether we are actually in Christ. And so stuff like gossip and dishonesty and double speak and cruel speech, all of that stuff makes no sense for the Christian. And in so many words, you seem to be saying like if you find yourself doing all of that, you should carefully examine what's going on because it has no place in the life of the Christian. Indeed, I think that might be one of the most convicting passages in the entire Bible for any one of us who takes an honest look at what the Bible has to say from beginning to end. They are tough, stern, honest, fair, needed words about the tongue and about how easy it is for that to get out of control. It's really clear that James is aware that Christians are suffering, that this is difficult, that suffering is external internal. It's coming from all over the place. But he's encouraging Christians by saying God is going to use that suffering to build in you something you can't build in yourself. And that is singleness of heart. All of the behavioral stuff that James addresses at some level can be boiled down to duplicitous in a saying you believe one thing, but doing another again, faith without works is dead. And he is urging his readers toward singleness of heart, believe the right things about Jesus, and then do the right things in keeping with that and don't have another version of yourself. So James then is saying that while suffering is unpleasant and unfun, it is something that God uses to drive people and refine Christians. Big picture. The book of James is a very practical book full of wisdom that can be very confrontive and jarring to read because of how close to home it hits again and again and again. And the big point that James seems to be driving at is that God uses suffering to refine the hearts of Christians away from duplicitousness and falseness and toward having a singleness of heart directed toward Christ. When you visualize the book of James, as gross as this sounds, picture the tongue. When you think about the theme, reflect on how James is designed to offer wisdom for gaining singleness of heart for God. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least check out chapter one achievement unlocked. There's the book of James next time around somebody we haven't heard from for a long time. Peter is back. We get the letter of first Peter up next. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
