We're doing something weird this week. We're working on a challenging high stakes for you and me passage in Galatians five, specifically it's Galatians five, 16, which says, so I say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. Other translations say the indulged the flesh. And I got my buddy Jeff here working it through with me all week. So we're just going to pick up where we left off yesterday. Yeah, let me break down what I mean. I think before the new life by faith in Christ, under the old covenant, before we have the Holy Spirit in dwelling and we're still under the law and slaves to sin. We don't have free will. We cannot please God, but with the spirit and the new identity in Christ, the life of Christ in us, that is a gift from God. Now we can choose to obey in ways we couldn't before. I think free will happens now for the followers of Christ in ways that couldn't happen before. And I think the Galatians have way more free will than they did before. Paul first brought them the gospel and he's I agree leaning into that saying you don't have to do that anymore. And because of the spirit, you can now follow the spirit. Yes, explicitly saying that. Uh huh. Again, if we have an old nature that will never lead us to choosing to obey, that means that the work of Christ wasn't sufficient, that there's still more we have to do. Whereas if no, we have a new identity, our old is crucified with Christ. Yeah. Now we actually have a free will we didn't have before. And sometimes in that freedom, we use it to indulge ourselves instead of to love our neighbor. And so somebody like Paul comes along and says, stop it. You don't have to do that anymore. So I think it's not feeding a nature versus another nature. It's yeah, I'm making a choice to be selfish and lead to sin, or I'm going to make the choice to obey by the power of the spirit and he'll bear the fruit in me. Clearly, you have freedom in Christ and you can use that freedom to do kingdom things. Okay. Do you do you remember? Did you have a class on a guston in seminary? Probably read all the books and all of it. Yeah, I'm sure I did, but do you were always more the church history guy? I did at some point. I think it was I think it was in seminary. Maybe it was undergrad. No, I think it was seminary and we just read all the gigantic works of a guston. And there is this, uh, this framework that he has for speaking to the different moments. In the life of the human as it relates to our freedom or ability to do things or not to do things, you're going to remember all this language. If you don't recall it already, he talks about the original state of humanity being a state of being able to sin. Paul say, Picard, right? Right. I said that. And it, I mean, it just means you are able to sin. But in the garden, humans hadn't flexed that muscle yet. We hadn't done it. So able to sin, but hadn't yet sinned. Well, then humans did sin. And so, you know, the tree or fruit, all of that stuff. So then after the fall, a guston said, let me make sure I'm getting this right. The next one would be not able not to sin. Known, post say known, picare. Not. Yeah. That's right. Not able not to sin. So then after the fall, all of humanity, this is the curse, this is the burden that we inherit from Adam. All of humanity is bound. We're slaves to this thing. We will sin. We can't not. And that is the state of humanity, all of humanity apart from Christ. But then once the individual encounters Christ, they become able not to sin. Forgive me, I'm having to really dig here. Able not to sin or post say non picare. That's right. Post say non picare. So now all of a sudden you can not sin. So like you were saying, this is a way freer state of being than you are before Jesus, because before Jesus, you, you can't not. Now you can not, according to Augustine, and then eventually. Christians reach this place of not able to sin. So it's like you run the whole gamut from the garden. All the way up till now, but back in the garden, we could sin. We just hadn't yet. But eventually when all is done and the redemptive plan has been seen all the way through. Christians reach this state of this would be known. Pase picare, not able to sin so that we're not, we're not just going to repeat the whole thing over again in heaven. When the serpent shows up because the serpent won't be there, the serpent will be defeated, the curse is defeated and lifted and broken. So instead, what's next in Christ is a new family of faith who are not able to sin. It's not even on the radar, but right now, according to Augustine, we're in the state of able not to sin, which is novel. You aren't that until you become a Christian. Do you remember that stuff? I do. What do you make of it? I do. And I remember it from, Oh, bondage of the will. Was that the name of the Luther book? Yeah. There you go. And just, yeah, the thoughts on what is depravity before salvation. And that's totally what Romans three, right? There's none that seek God. There's none that does right for all of sin, a fall short of the glory of God. So the idea of corruption being total of all creation and certainly of the human soul because of Adam, I think that's all over, especially Romans, which is, like you said, the pinch zoom out of Galatians. But I resist the idea of perpetual depravity that even after the new birth and the indwelling Holy Spirit and the new identity, and Christ, that somehow we still are this half depraved person. I just don't see that in the text anywhere. Now, we still haven't gotten to that point that you mentioned, you know, in the eternal state, right? Where it's not possible to sin. Whereas now it still is very possible to sin and we do it all the time. But I think it could, if you really boil it down, I think it's identity versus behavior and identity is what matters. Like somebody or us before Jesus got ahold of us, right? We could do good things, but that didn't mean our identity was alive to God. And in the same way, now that the work of the Spirit has changed our identity and the life of Christ is now in us, that doesn't mean we'll never sin. It just means our identity is now secure and safe. And the more we understand that, the more our behavior will line up to that. So the big question, what do we do? I think act like who you are and be free in that. OK, we could be accused of having dizzying intellects here, which is not a compliment. That is that's what happens when you get deep into it and you're using a lot of words to try to sort through something. I do think this is a hard part of the Bible. The more we talk, the more work I have to do. So what are we doing? OK, so we better bottom line this because I think I think we ended up at four episodes here of just you and I work shopping this idea. Yeah, just trying to make sense of it in front of everybody who's here. We need to bottom line this bottom line is Paul's I'll do one, then you do one bottom line. Paul is arguing throughout Galatians and everything that he writes that there is no life in human effort, but that right standing with God and life happens through faith and through Christ alone. And that the life we live in the body, we live by the Spirit. There, that's one of my bottom lines. Now you take a bottom line. I think the bottom line is humanity is built to run on the life of God. And any attempt to do it any other way is just going to lead to destruction. And in Galatians, we are pushing back on one of those any other ways, that being the teachings of the Judaizers. Yeah, I think so. Who are depending on the law, which would mean that here as we get to the end on the life by the Spirit stuff, Paul is pulling back a little bit from this one competing idea or approach that has been in view because the Judaizers showed up and because they poisoned the well in Galatia and because they brought their circumcision tools. This competing non life by the Spirit, this version of life by the flesh is the one we've been talking about in Galatians for five chapters. But you're saying anything that competes with life by the Spirit, anything that competes with faith in Christ alone is is in view here at the end as something that is antithetical and fruitless compared to life by the Spirit. Absolutely. Okay. Okay. So then bottom line this for me, somebody's listening to this podcast. There are 195 episodes in. They're like, cool. This makes sense. I think there's a God. I think Paul is right. I think faith alone in Jesus alone, that makes perfect sense. I think I will not go get adult circumcised or adult re-circumcised as it may be. And I want to do like Paul is one the day. I want to do what he says and live like that. What is it, Jeff? What is the right response to all this? I have been crucified with Christ. It's no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And so the life I now live, I live by faith in the one who loved me and gave himself for me. I think it has to start there because I am in a covenantal relationship with one who loves me and gave himself for me. I am free to make decisions out of love and joy and appreciation for that relationship and not bound by religiosity or performance, you know, means to somehow keep him happy or fix myself. It's life by the Spirit. It's a relationship with God that we're talking about who you're actually indwelt by the God you're worshiping when you're a Christian. You're indwelt by the God you're trying to obey while you're a Christian. So that's a pretty big advantage compared to other religions when it comes to the personal devotion side of practicing Christianity. But also I'd go back to that thing. I was saying a little bit ago, it feels like I make choices and it feels like there are things and habits that I can put into my life. That I know take my brain and my heart and my soul to places that aren't good for me, aren't good for other people. Maybe sometimes they're even overtly sinful toward God and whether it's God guiding me to want to avoid that or me picking. You know, sometimes it's good to think about that. Other times it's just good to be like, hey, I know exactly dang well what I'm doing here and it's destructive and I'm going to put some things in place to help. Defeat that whether it's, you know, having somebody I care about who I'm really honest with or whether it's just removing certain temptations from arms reach in my life or whether it's just building my daily rhythm in such a way that it's informed by scripture or things that are beautiful and noble and praise worthy. I am going to try to do that because I'm grateful to God and I would like to obey him because he did something for me. I couldn't do for myself and I like him. I think I love God. And so sometimes I'm going to come out of the ethereal theological clouds and just very practically think strategically and shrewdly and be like, I want to obey you. Theologically, I believe that the ability to do that is from you, God. Also, there are very practical things that I know that if I if I do this, I am more likely to live a life of gratitude toward God than I am if I don't do that. So I'm going to try. I don't think that's why I don't think my effort has anything to do with my right standing before God. I'm just really grateful and I want to try to show that and it feels like I try. So since it feels that way on some level, I'm, you know, I want to do my best to communicate my gratitude and I think the values of the kingdom are the best and I want to embrace them. I want them for me from other people and I want to give them to other people. Maybe that sounds a little old school, but I mean, that's that's honestly where I'm at for better or worse. Yeah. Well, bottom line, I don't think either of us are reading Galatians here and coming away saying, Oh, well, God clearly, you know, just wants me to work harder and eventually. He'll be impressed. It seems to be the other way around that this faith, this, this right standing before God through the work of Christ, it produces things in us by the spirit. And I'm excited about those things and it might practically speaking feel like those are coming from me, but there are results of the spirit that lives in me. Yeah. And maybe to put a pin in the whole relationship side of this, like, I want to do things that make my wife happy, not because I'm supposed to be a good husband, but because I've loved her for 30 years. And when I fail as a husband, it's not because I have some non husband in me that still wants to be fed. It's because I don't always act in accordance with my identity as a husband. So I try to remember how much she loves me and how much I love her. And then I act differently. Sometimes. So you walk by, you live by being in love with Abby. It just happens. Jeff Foote, ladies and gentlemen, that's my buddy, Jeff Foote. Thanks for helping me grind it through. Seriously, dude, I appreciate it. I'm asking you to just do this in real time, like a normal person, how we would normally talk about it. And it's difficult to, you know, try to put the bow on it that I have just asked you to put on it, but you've done a good job. And it's been very helpful and I am very grateful. And we got more to unpack hearing Galatians. So we're going to continue to move forward on this, but there is one final note that I think is just fair here. And that is that I would like to read to you what the 2011 new international version does with this passage. Do you know already? I don't. Here it is. You, my brothers and sisters were called to be free, but do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh. Rather serve one another humbly in love. What do you think of that? I'm surprised, but pleasantly so. It's just translation kind of happens in real time and moments in history. I thought it was really interesting that the updated version of the NIV addresses that a little bit differently addresses it more like the English standard version. So fascinating. Yeah. Well, thanks for having me on. I'm looking forward to editing out all the parts where I sounded dumb. You should probably leave in a few so people know you're human. All right, that's plenty more up there. Thanks everybody for kind of a different week here. And next week will probably be more like a normal week. All right, that's plenty. I'm Matt.
