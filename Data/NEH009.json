I don't mean like physically, I don't know, maybe he looked and maybe he worked out. I don't have any, it doesn't speak to that at all. I just mean the story of Ezra is so well built. It's structured in a way that's really satisfying. And we've talked in the other conversations you and I have had before about story structure and plot structure in movies. And usually if the structure of a story is just great, you don't even notice it because everything gets paid off when it should. The characters encounter tension when they should. You got a two hour movie and everything moves at the right pace. You don't know, you just get done. You're like, that was great. You're so satisfying. Perfect plot structure movies would be like Toy Story 3, The Incredibles. I guess those are both animated Pixar. Let's go with something that's the physical real world. What's one with Clint Eastwood? It was just great in Detroit. Gran Turino that is a perfectly built plot structure. Everything pays off when it ought to pay off. The tensions show up when they ought to show up. Look, I've been sitting here pouring over the book of Ezra a whole bunch. The last week, it's the prequel to Nehemiah. We got to get a good sense of what's going on in this book to appreciate what we're about to spend a lot of time on, which is Nehemiah. They really are not. It's not even a prequel. They're really the same book effectively. And as I've been sitting here looking at it, the first half of Ezra, which is the story of the rebuilding of the temple, is super, super satisfying to a modern brain because the plot just rolls along the way you and I would expect a plot to work. It is effectively a three act structure story that has a prologue. You know what I mean by prologue, right? There are some movies that follow the obvious motion picture, three act structure, but you get a prologue at the beginning that doesn't really count as an act. It's like a little bonus thing to tee everybody up in the Star Wars movies. It's just the title crawl in Willow. I don't know. I always reference that movie because it's awful when I look at it now, but it was great when I was a kid. It's got the shrouded in mystery and pen flutes and prophecies and there's a baby's chosen one. You get all of that stuff to set things up before you get rolling into act one. Ezra gives us that. Chapter one of the book of Ezra is all about the backstory of an exile and the look hopeless and this is about a people who are losing touch with who they are and their purpose. They're very important purpose in the world, but there was a prophecy and it feels like this whole thing would be done with that kind of voice, but better than I can do it. And the prophesied one shows up. It's Cyrus the Great and he issues an edict and that is our initiating event for the book of Ezra and now stuff is off and running and somewhere between the end of chapter one and the beginning of chapter two, we pick up just like we do in any three act structure story with a look at the normal everyday life, the current circumstances of the main characters we're going to be following. And what are those circumstances? Was Jewish people being in Persia? And now I mean, it's equivalent to having your mortgage get sold. Now they're under their second overlord. It's the Persians. They don't it's new. They don't really know how that's going to work out, but they got like businesses and lives there and stuff and the priests are still training to be priests, even though they don't have anywhere to do priestly things. And then the edict comes down and that serves in the three act movie structure is the call to adventure. There's always a call to adventure moment somewhere between about minute 12 and minute 17. The hero always gets invited to embark on this journey and usually they kind of bulk at first, but or a party who is maybe unwilling at first, they'll gather together and they will go. Well, we'll see as we get into chapter two here that most of the Jews did not heed the call to adventure, but a small percentage did 40 some thousand of them decided we're going to do this thing. And here are their names. Then as we get to the end of chapter two, we discover that we're not going to get the detail of the hilarious buddy comedy road trip kind of thing. We're just going to get the quick travel montage more like Indiana Jones style where you got the red dots and the lines and you go to different airports and stop the things and pick up some more gas and then you go to the other thing, then you travel into the remote parts and you land and we're back to the adventure. And of course, when you get a travel montage, you assume that everything just went great on the trip is normal travel. There's nothing notable there for the plot. And likewise here in Ezra, because we just skip over the trip, we assume the trip went great and our suspicions that it went great are confirmed here in the middle of this first act that's setting everything up when the exiles arrive in Jerusalem starting in verse 68 and they're in great spirits and they've got total focus as to why they're there and what they need to do. It goes like this, when they arrived at the house of the Lord in Jerusalem and by house of the Lord here, we mean pile of rubble overgrown with weeds where the grand temple of Solomon used to be when they arrived at the house of the Lord in Jerusalem. Some of the heads of the families gave free will offerings toward the rebuilding of the house of God on its site. So even after that really long trip, they're still in a very giving mood. I don't feel that way when I travel super long and I'm in and out of airports and stuff. So there's something really special happening here and people start imitating each other's generosity according to what they have. This is according to their ability. They gave to the treasury for this work, 61,000 drakmas of gold, 5,000 minus of silver and 100 priestly garments. So there's funding to make this thing happen to the tune of 61,000 derricks. I guess here they're calling it drakmas, which I don't know how much that is, but it's a lot. Actually, wait a second. I got a note down here in my Bible, derricks or drakmas, thick gold Persian coins each weighing 46 ounce. There is no hold up. Okay. I've got a Bible note error on my hands here. They're saying it's a 46 ounce coin. I think I think once a coin gets to be 46 ounces, it's not really a coin anymore. Hang on a sec. I have a Derek here. It's not gold, but I have a silver one. Hang on. I'm coming back. All right. In my right hand, I have a Persian coin from this era. This is a Derek and I'm going to drop it on my desk right now. And you tell me if this sounds like three pounds worth of metal. No, it doesn't. That's not even an ounce. Hang on a second. Now I got to know how much is a Derek? How much of these people actually donate? It starts the thing. How much Persian almost got it? Yeah. There we go. It's like eight ounces, eight ounces. No, no, no, eight grams. Okay. So 31.1 grams in a Troy ounce. So we're talking about quarter ounce gold coins, basically is what we're looking at. And let's just figure out how much money that was since we're here and we got a calculator open anyway from the other day. All right. So we got 61,000 coins, but they're quarter ounces. So if we want to know how many ounces there were, we're just going to divide that by four. We got 15,250 ounces of gold. They got donated and let's just go with about $2,000 per ounce. It's about what it is now. Times 2000. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. That's 30 million bucks plus that they raised in one day with a free well offering. People went on a road trip through the desert for presumably months. And then when they got there, they were in such good spirits that they kicked in $30 million of their own money to build this thing instead of whining to the king or a governor to do it. 30 million bucks, my friends. That really tells a story about how much these people not only wanted to see a temple built, but they wanted to see it built not with imperial money if they could avoid it. They at least wanted to take as much responsibility and ownership of this thing as they possibly could with their own resources. I think that's just, that's amazing. So at this point in our three act structure, we haven't really run into any trouble yet. There's no human opposition. This is more of a man versus nature tension in this plot. You have entropy, you just have land and some rocks there and you're trying to build a big, beautiful thing. That's your challenge. The bad guy is nature and you have to overcome just the raw difficulty of trying to build something amazing. That's not just a physical thing in terms of building the temple, but it's also, we discover here and through the rest of Ezra and Nehemiah, that we're also trying to rebuild a people. We're also trying to rebuild a functioning daily rhythm of a relationship between these people and God. And the one is kind of a metaphor for the other because this is fantastic writing. There's going to be multiple layers of meaning. So the exiles return. And in chapter three, we hear more about this guy, Zerupah-bulm, who is the leader of this effort. And there's really nobody who could have come on this journey who would have lent more credibility, just more gravity in terms of his name and who he is and his pedigree than Zerupah-bulm. He, if there was still a monarchy here, would be the king. He's descended from David. And remember, there's still this promise hanging out there from God, an unconditional promise that he made to David way back in the day where David was like, I should build you a temple and God was like, cool, you know what, I'm going to have one of your descendants do that. Instead, I'm going to build something for you, a royal house that's never going to go away. There's a lot of paraphrase here, but basically God makes an unconditional deal. And it's like, even if you're an idiot and David would take him up on that, even if you're an idiot, this promise is still going to last. One of your descendants is going to be the great king, the promised king. And he's going to reign on your throne forever. Then of course, I mean, that turns out to be Jesus. And so the fact that we still have some kind of custody of that line with Zerupah-bulm, even after all of this exile stuff, that's really exciting. He's very, very important. And here he is showing up and we find in the beginning of chapter three that he's got his head screwed on straight. And his first priority is let's get going with the burn offerings and everything else. So he has an altar built first. And then they celebrate a whole bunch of the sacrifices, the Feast of Tabernacles, a whole bunch of offerings, the New Moon sacrifices. And they do all of that in basically the same order that Solomon did back in first kings, when he was fixing to have his temple built and dedicated and everything there. So they're trying to tap into that stuff from the past and write things that went wrong in the 500 years between the building of the old temple and the attempt to build this new temple. Now, and then it says in verse six of Ezra three, big moment right here on the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord, though the foundation of the Lord's temple had not yet been laid. And then the very next thing that happens right after that, verse seven, they gave money to the masons, the carpenters, they gave food and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tires so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Japa as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia. And they get cracking on things and they build throughout the rest of chapter three, all the way up to the point where they've got the foundations in place. And now it's time to dedicate the foundation of the temple. And this is maybe where we run into the first meaningful speed bump. The first change up in terms of the emotional beats of this story, it happens at the dedication of the foundation of the temple at the end of Ezra three. And at the point that I guess maybe we could say he's getting toward the end of act one. And so we'll pick up with the end of act one beginning of act two in this well put together story next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
