This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and I like tennis. I have not always liked tennis. This is a relatively recent thing. A couple years ago, I played my first scored doubles match. I hit it around with friends for a few years before that, but really didn't have any idea what I was doing or how the sport worked. And now I'm learning that because I'm around real experienced tennis people who've been playing for 30 years. They played in high school or college and there's a whole culture to it that I didn't know about. I didn't understand. I just kind of, I'm a baseball player. He's run up there and try to whack the ball real hard. And if you get it in, it looks cool. And that's awesome. There's a reason that people play tennis the way they play tennis. I'm learning all of this stuff and it's such an interesting social game because again, the old Hulk smash just when that's the point, it doesn't work that way. You have to get people to play with you in tennis. And that means that you have to play tennis a certain way that makes it enjoyable win or lose for everyone, even if you're playing competitive matches. And I'm learning this in part by watching some very physically talented and socially sophisticated people in our local tennis community play matches. And I noticed there are some guys who are really, really good, like, man, I aspire to be good like that someday. But I also noticed they're very nice and they hold up from time to time. If they can take a point without dramatically taking a point, I noticed they'll choose to do that. I'm like, well, why? Why wouldn't you just destroy it and guarantee it? And then at other times, I'll see these guys pass up a point, even give up a game here there. And I'm like, I've played with you a lot. What would be the strategic advantage to not winning in that moment? I put that thing away. Do your thing. Well, the more I'm around it, the more I start to get it. Sometimes if you want to actually be an adult who can get tennis matches in play, total domination isn't necessarily the best strategy. A degree of meekness from time to time is a good idea. It's courteous. It keeps other people involved. You can still have your win if you really want it, but it doesn't matter that much. And so I've been fascinated to watch these excellent male and female players demonstrate this restraint. And it seems like people really like playing with them. And I'm taking notes because I would like to be somebody who people like to play with as well. And for me, of course, it's not really a question of, oh, I should probably hold back because I'm just not all that good. But I use that word restraint. And before that, I used that word meekness, which maybe pops for you from all the way back in the first public words that Jesus said in the book of Matthew that we were looking at. Remember, that's the sermon on the Mount. He just called his first round of disciples and then he takes them up on a mountain side to teach them. And you'll remember in Matthew five, there are a lot of people there. This is where we're kind of introduced to the idea that all these teachings of Jesus that happen in public, you got three groups present. You've got the totally in group like the disciples, although at this point they don't completely understand why they're in yet. They're just compelled. You've got the totally angry out group who aren't there to learn or grow. They already are infallible and write about everything. They're just trying to figure out how Jesus is wrong about something and what they might do about that. And then you've got the ever present through all of history, squishy middle and that squishy middle in democracy, they decide all of the elections. That is the people who are often least invested. And those are the folks who will just bounce around all over the place. And it's kind of the fuel that makes modern democracy go. Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to totally criticize the squishy middle. The squishy middle in a democracy like ours keeps things in check because they do waver back and forth and they prevent anyone party from gaining too much power. So high five squishy middle. I do appreciate you for that. But in the beginning of Matthew five, those three groups are present and Jesus is teaching his disciples as those other two groups listen in as well. And he opens his sermon on the Mount. He opens his manifesto of what he's going for here and what he's doing with these beatitudes, these statements of blessed are. And you'll recall that the third one is blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth. And we said back when we looked at Matthew five that these are not a new 10 commandments like, Hey, go do these things so that you will get these things rather first and foremost. They shake out as being a statement of values. The values of the world are the opposite of the beatitudes. But in the kingdom, different things are valued. It's an upside down kingdom that works differently. The King values different things. So we have this idea of meekness of this restraint. It's not weakness and smallness. I mean, that's often what the word conjures, but it really at its core, definitionally has this built in notion of restraint. And in Matthew chapter five, of course, mathematically, we're just rolling off of Matthew chapter four. And in Matthew chapter four, you will recall that Jesus is tempted by the devil himself. The devil takes a real big swipe. It's almost like this is the part of the narrative looking back on the whole thing we can now see where the devil's strategy is like, let's just see if we can win this thing with negotiation. Had be way easier than going to war. We can just work it out with a conversation. And so in a mockery of Jesus instructions in Matthew 18, the devil goes to Jesus alone and in private to bring his concerns and his suggestions to work it out. You recall Matthew four demonstrates that the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit plays a role in this because Jesus doesn't just go out into the desert on his own, but he's led by the spirit out into the desert. And then out there for 40 days, which seems like a lot longer since my family and I have started watching that alone series on history channel. So Jesus is not going to be in physically great shape here yet spiritually. He is in great shape here. And after all of this difficult time, Satan shows up and basically the deal he tries to strike is, hey, let's just skip the will of your father. Let's mostly do the will of your father. And let's just get right to this kingdom thing that you want to initiate where your king. I can help you save a few steps here. Like, look at how miserable this has been. What you're going through. I'm doing massive paraphrasing here. But, you know, like if we partnered up on this deal or better yet, if you just let me handle it for you since I'm right now functionally kind of the king of this world or I style myself as the king of this world, you know, bend the knee to me and you can have all of this stuff and you can have it without any more of this miserable pain because the devil goes on further paraphrases mine like you throw yourself off of this high place and you have angels that you can command and be like, just come save me. Pick me up. You don't need to go through all of this suffering stuff and difficulty. There is another way and I am that other way. Choose me. I am that other gate. Enter into your kingdom and kingship through it. That would seem to be the play. Well, as you'll recall, Jesus relying on the word of God absolutely shoots down all of these things and this is one of a few times in the Bible where Jesus effectively stiff arms Satan and says away from me, Satan and continues to focus on the will of the father. Of course, we see that again in Matthew 16, though it isn't Satan speaking. It's Peter speaking, but his words are representative of effectively the same strategy that Satan was pitching to him back here in the temptation. It's really a second version of the temptation, if you will, and Jesus passes the test again. Well now we're running into another test in Matthew 27 and this is a big one. The test is now multifaceted. The test is, hey, are you sure you still want to choose the path of pain here? Is that offer maybe still outstanding from Satan? Even if that offer isn't still available from Satan, are you sure you don't want to just call on some kind of help because you don't have to endure all of this? You have the power not to go any further down the road of this cross. You have the power not to suffer anymore. You have the power to put an end to this mockery and to put everyone in their place right now. You could do that. And there's a further temptation. Are you sure you're committed to the values of this kingdom? I mean, you said the meek will inherit the earth and I suppose that now is this thing as unfolding is starting to look like it could be a little bit prophetic and could even kind of play out in a way that adds additional meaning back into that beatitude in Matthew 5. But are you sure is meek really the thing that you want to be? Do you really want to just voluntarily take this loss when you are the dominant player and you could just put this ball away dramatically and have everybody ooh and awe and you could just have a gigantic win here? I mean, you could do that if you wanted to. That is all implicit. That's all in the mind of Jesus. How do I know that one? Common sense too? Just thinking back to the prayer in the garden just a couple pages ago right here. We know Jesus was fully aware that he could mash that tennis ball at the net. Take this win using his own dominance and his own power, but in the same way that I have seen excellent tennis players look at who they're playing with, look at the social situation, look at the bigger picture of their life in the community and every now and then turn down an easy ball that they could have dominated with. So Jesus is going to size all of those things up and he's going to pass on the opportunity to dominate in a conventional sense here in the same way. Once again, that these impressive tennis players I observe pass up a ball. I know they can destroy because they're playing a bigger game. They care about the relationships. They care about what's going on in the mind of the other person. So Jesus is playing a different game. He's trying to achieve something other than military victory or self preservation here and that makes his behavior at first glance seem self destructive and baffling. But if we think about his behavior for another minute, it should stir in us a curiosity as to why he would do that. And then all we have to do is think back on all the things we've seen so far in Matthew and it clicks. He is playing a different game. Passing up that ball and losing is how he's going to win. Validation is how he's going to be exalted. His death is how he's going to bring life. What is happening right here at the crucifixion is in keeping with and even fulfillment of all of those upside down kingdom values that he was talking about in the Sermon on the Mount and that he continued to talk about and live out in the interim up to this point where we are in the text. I just read a couple of brand new incredibly kind reviews that some of you left here over the last few days. Golly, that is nice of you. Thank you. What a jolt of encouragement that is not that I'm discouraged. This is blast even talking about the difficult stuff here. I love that we get to spend this time together and hearing from you that that is in some way meaningful is that's a big deal for me. So thanks again for doing that. It means a lot. You know who you are. I appreciate you. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this next week.
