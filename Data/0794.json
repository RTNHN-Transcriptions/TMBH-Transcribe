This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. We're right at the very, very end of Matthew. And I promised you a couple episodes ago, last week, whatever, that wasn't going to be all emotional about stuff. And this is not my way of warming up to being like, and now I'm going to be all emotional about stuff. No, but it is striking that we're down to our last two conversations. And it is also striking to me the way our friend Matthew has crafted the feel, the flow of this book has crafted the notes, the ups and the downs that have led us through the whole thing to get us to a place here where we close strong, we close succinct, and we close with a commissioning, a sense of being sent out from this encounter with this story and this king and this kingdom with kind of a sense of like, Hey, here's what's next. And no matter when you are reading this, at least until the unfolding of events that Jesus describes in chapters 24 and 25 and the Olivet Discourse, if you're reading any time between the time it was written and whenever that happens, the what happens next thing is the same. What happens next is that Jesus is going to build his kingdom and that he's going to use people who are as flawed or at times, maybe even more flawed than the disciples we see described in the book of Matthew to do it. What an interesting fusion of the work of God in its infinite perfection and the flawed work of his subjects. But that theme seems to exist throughout the Bible. And of course, God could have done all this stuff his own way, which is snaps of fingers and God power, whatever, I mean, he has all authority on heaven and earth. But instead, we see this invitation to the unbelievable honor and blessing of being a part of this new family of faith and having agency, having a role in making it and participating in it in a way that is not patronizing, but that actually does something and that counts to do something and participate in something that out lives this lifetime and that accomplishes what is like the holy grail of the human pursuit of legacy that is accomplished something that out lives your name being remembered. That doesn't happen very often. So Jesus is landing the plane with his disciples here and he comes to them after rising from the grave and saying, meet me on that mountain. You know the one up in Galilee and they show up and Jesus says even knowing that they are doubting even as they speak, they are wrestling with a variety of flavors of different very human, very honest doubt. He goes right at it and says, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. We talked about that, traced it all the way through the book of Matthew a couple episodes back, therefore go and make disciples of all nations. He absolutely drills another theme that we've traced many times in our journey through Matthew together. That being the theme of a vision for humanity, for the planet, for all of the diverse and different peoples from all around the world, cultures, languages, everything, there is something unifying. There's something bigger than all of that. When Jesus is saying this, it looked like Rome was going to take a swing at unifying the entire planet under the sword and under the eagle, the banner of Rome and ultimately they failed and ultimately everyone has failed. And even if somebody's able to hold the entire risk board for a moment at some point in history, it'll be at the point of a gun. What's being described here is not a nation state. It's not a tax citizenry. It's not an occupation. It's a family of faith. So we get the authority thing. We get the new family of faith thing. Then we get the new sign of the covenant thing. This gets a little loaded. There are a lot of different key phrases from theological tradition to theological tradition that get employed when thinking about how exactly to characterize baptism, this next thing that he commissions them to. What does baptism do exactly? And at the simplest level, there are Christians who would say, you baptize somebody. That brings them into the institution that is the church. Effectively, they serve as a mediator between God and man. And if you are somehow functionally associated with the church through baptism, then you go to heaven. You're in the kingdom. You're part of the new family of faith. I've always been honest about what I think with you. That is not how I read the rest of the Bible. That's not how I read what Jesus is saying here. There are other Christians who look at this and say, baptism does not create union with a church or an institution, but rather baptism is an expression of belief in God and that it's demonstrative of life and death and resurrection above the water, in the water back up. There are people who look at this and say, no, you don't dip people into the water. The original Greek language of the word itself is effectively too dip. It's a verb, but I fully acknowledge there are a lot of Christians from a lot of history who would say, no, no, that's not how you do it. You use less water as it were. I don't want to use one of our last two conversations on Matthew to have that whole debate. There are lots of podcasts that other people do where they can walk you through in detail. Everybody's position on baptism. I covered some of that stuff early on in chapter three when we looked at John the Baptist. Rather, I want to look at this in light of everything that's going on here in this passage in chapter 28. What Jesus seems to be granting the disciples with here, equipping them with is something to mark it by. Something to say, hey, the new family of faith thing has happened and the world needs to know. Maybe even you need a point that you can point to as an individual to say before the waters of baptism. I was here. I was an enemy of God. I was not a child of the king. I was fully committed to the world system, a slave to the world system. But now in the language of the Lord's prayer from the Sermon on the Mount, I have bent the knee to the great king who has true authority, the truest, realist thing with values that I want, the truest, realist values. But I am not a child of the world, I am a child of the king, and baptism in that sense, no matter how you slice it theologically, baptism in that sense then becomes that marker that Christians from the very beginning use as an image, use as an outward sign, some would even say an efficacious spiritual gesture, a ritual that includes within it the power of God in the gesture itself. But Christians for 2000 years since have been doing this and they've been doing it exactly the way he said these three names in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Now the Holy Spirit hasn't been talked about a whole bunch yet. And the Holy Spirit comes up and acts here a little bit later much more distinctively. But you're catching it. This is another one of those bookends. Where do we first hear about baptism? We hear about that in chapter three with John the Baptist and then Jesus baptism. What happens at the end of chapter three? Jesus gets baptized. Who shows up? The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. They're all present to Jesus baptism. They're all present to everybody's baptism. So in light of what we've seen through the Old Testament, through all of the book of Matthew, what you've got then is a king who is wildly authoritative to make such proclamations, he can back those things up, he can deliver on the values of his kingdom, he can protect his kingdom, he can provide for his subjects, he can declare his enemies to be heirs and children and agents if he so chooses. He can give grace to whomever he wants. If he wants to make a new family of faith, he could make one up out of the stones if he felt like it. Instead, he raises up a new family of faith out of people made in his own image. And then he equips his disciples with this external physical act, this practice, this ordinance, this sacrament that is demonstrative of death to the old self, dying, having death defeated in Christ and rising again as a child of the king. It is profound, dramatic language. And even the Christian differences on exactly how to nuance it and what it means does nothing to blunt the depth and power and payoff narratively thematically that this gift of baptism being given here in chapter 28 is coming out of everything we've seen in the book of Matthew. Speaking of the book of Matthew tomorrow, we're going to finish it. And then on Monday, we're just going to start on the next thing, which is that we're going to go through the entire Bible one book per day until we've covered them all. And then when we're done with that, however long that takes, we will start on the book of Esther. So if you've been waiting to invite somebody and you're like, I, you know, it's a lot to come in on this Matthew thing, it's been, it's been good or whatever. I hope that's what you think. It's been good. I mean, you're here, but you know, it's intimidating for them. Okay. This is your chance. You get the weekend. You get the New Year's resolution thing. You got the let's work on this together and be friends and let's go through it together and let's talk about it and let's make a plan for this. I would be so grateful if you would go with me into this next project, this next series. And I would be so grateful if you'd consider inviting someone. That'd be awesome. Last day on Matthew tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
