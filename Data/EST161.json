And right now, we're going through Esther. Had you guys ever hear about Christopher Columbus? He's an Italian guy apparently who looked at the world and was like, you know what, everybody thinks you can't just go around it to get where you're going. I bet you could. And I'm going to see if I can get some boats. I can rent some boats. I'm going to take those boats. I'm just going to say I'm going to sail in the direction that I want to go. And if I go far enough, I bet it's going to work. And the bunch of people don't want to give him any money or any boats finally ends up renting some boats from a Spanish lady and her husband. And he goes sailing west just out into the sea monster infested waters of the Atlantic Ocean. And sure enough, he runs into something. He thinks it's India, but it's not India at all. We mislabels it. His maps all screwed up and weird. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Turns out he landed, I think on his band Yola is what I remember, the Haiti Dominican Republic Island. And I think he made his first landfall and modern day on Duros. I think correct me if I'm wrong. And there's, I mean, there's even a little, I rhyme about it and everything. So you can remember when he sailed and all of this stuff all happened in the 1400s. Very big deal, very, very big deal. And for a long time, everybody was really excited about Columbus because of what this stuff I just said. And even when I was a kid, I remember my teachers were like, he's a great man. He's heroic. That was brave. These are the values that we want for people to not take no for an answer and pull yourself up by your bootstraps and not to be afraid of the unknown and things like that. It was a very good lesson. I remember thinking Columbus guy sounded very, very impressive, but as I got a little bit older, middle school and high school, the public sentiment about this Christopher Columbus fellow started to change and more people started to look at that and they were like, well, I think it was kind of a jerk. Because he had better guns and better technology and money. And then he goes and runs into a bunch of people who are in a totally different era in terms of technology and the development of their culture. And of course, he wins at everything. And he's got all the cool stuff. And so he wins at everything and he ends up running rough shot over all the people there. Even if he had meant to be nice, it wasn't nice. It wasn't going to work out and it begins a whole history of exploitation of the Western hemisphere. And you know, okay, maybe you got a point over there too. My role here is not to solve the age old debate about Columbus, but rather to acknowledge that just in my lifetime, I can think of people singing the praises effusively of Christopher Columbus and saying this guy should be a moral example to young people. And then I can think of other people absolutely speaking in the most damning of terms about Christopher Columbus. And he's saying this is a perfect example of the moral rot of Europe. This is what's wrong with everything. This is enemy number one of the history of all that is good in the Western world. They're looking at the same stack of data. Well, that's not necessarily true. They're looking at some of the same data and they're probably both ignoring some of it that they don't like. But basically they have access to the same information. They're coming to totally different conclusions about what you do with the character. Likewise, in the book of Esther, we got a situation where we have four characters on screen and I think two of them are very easy to interpret. But I think two of them are a little bit trickier. Heyman is obviously bad. This isn't hard. I can't imagine anybody reading the book of Esther and being like, well, if you look a little bit more closely, if you think about it, no, he's just an awful genocidal, prideful, insecure, idiot. And if anything, you're supposed to read Heyman and pity him a little bit because he thought he was going to win some little political squabble and didn't realize he was fighting against the God of Abraham who you just don't beat. And he literally makes his own gallows. He swings on his own gallows. And he got Xerxes. Pretty obviously you're supposed to see him as a clown king who is influenceable, manipulatable, acts like he's totally in charge but isn't really in charge. But then you got Mordecai and Esther. And Esther in particular, I think she gets a little bit more of that Christopher Columbus treatment through the years where people don't know exactly what to make of her. Now, in recent American Christian bookstore, pop Christian kind of culture, Esther's just lionized without any qualification. She's great. She's a model of chastity and great decision making. And she's also kind of taps into some of that stuff about heroism and bravery and all of those virtues that everybody likes. And she's a great example for how a young lady ought to conduct herself. It's just that simple, right? Faithful to God, absolutely faithful. But there've been a whole lot of other people, not just recently, but over the centuries, who looked at Esther and they're like, you know, she's more of an archetypical, prototypical queen of a powerful emperor from the late ancient world. She gets her hands on power. And when she briefly has it through her relationship with her husband, she uses it decisively and violently to move forward the things that she wants to accomplish. Picture a mistress who we read about a whole bunch earlier on when we were learning about Xerxes from the account of Herodotus. She was a powerful, formidable woman who did some pretty wild things, blood was shed. And she knew that as long as she didn't embarrass or undermine her husband, it was probably going to work out. In fact, a lot of these Persian wives are depicted as being frighteningly powerful and more than willing to make the political maneuvers that they need to make. There's some people who interpret Esther through the lenses of her contemporaries. That is this kind of very violent, very opportunistic, very cunning, very clever, very brave queen. That is completely different. I mean, the two views on Columbus are about as diametrically opposed as the chased, humble, easygoing model for young girl's vision, interpretation of Esther versus the very formidable ancient Near Eastern queen vision of Esther. So what is it? How are we supposed to read it as we see the violence that's unfolding in Esther, chapter nine violence that again, the original author seems to have no quibbles with whatsoever. I mean, if we just read about who Esther is and her role in all of this, the way she used her cunning, the coldness with which she let Haman beg for his life and said nothing. And so for those throughout the ages who have interpreted her more as the ruthless formidable ancient Near Eastern queen type, they get a little bit more fuel to their fire when they get to this next part in Esther chapter nine. And we get to the end of the first day of all of this fighting and everything that's happened. But Queen Esther surveys the landscape of all of this and is like, I don't know that that was actually quite enough. And she goes back to the king for more. Here's how that goes. Esther nine, 11, the number of those slain in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day. The king said to Queen Esther, the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and to the 10 sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done to the rest of the king's provinces? Now what's your petition? It'll be given you what's your request. It'll also be granted. And she says verse 13 of Esther nine, if it pleases the king, Esther answered, give the Jews and Susa permission to carry out this day's edict tomorrow also and let Haman's 10 sons be hanged on gallows. Whoa. She's not content with what's happened so far. She's not satisfied that that actually solves the problem. If that is indeed what she's trying to do is just solve the problem. Maybe it is punitive at this point. We got to think about that more together, but she's going pretty big. I don't know that I want to raise my daughters to think in these categories and to see a situation like this and be like, well, okay, we defended ourselves, but I'd like some of my enemies to be put up on polls, please. I don't, I'm not actively nurturing that kind of moral decision making on their part. Also, I wasn't there and my entire people group was not threatened by this guy and presumably by his family. Now she wants another day. She doesn't feel like the situation is resolved. Whatever resolved means. And this little exchange right here, I think is the bit that has caused a lot of people through history to look at her and say, okay, she's a hero. She's a good guy, but also she's meant to be understood as someone to be feared, a formidable good guy or maybe even morally compromised character, but ultimately leads to good things or a time of peace. So this passage right here is where we start to see the interpretive paths really diverge when it comes to what you make of Esther. And just honestly, I don't think the most pleasant read on her character survives this passage very well. I think after you read the middle of Esther nine here, like we just did, the most charitable interpretation of her character would be that she was shrewd and was clever and did unfortunate things that if you were there, you would understand that she had to do. And she had womanly graces and she knew how to be kind and charming and how to manage a relationship. And she was emotionally attentive to her husband. Well enough to know how to redirect his power in productive ways as opposed to being redirected in destructive ways as other people who were trying to manipulate him were trying to accomplish. And I suppose in the same way that I could listen to two people who feel very strongly in different ways about Columbus, kind of work through their thoughts about that and what it all means and what its exemplary of morally. Well, so I imagine that two people who love this document and think it's from God could look at the character of Esther and come to different conclusions in terms of what exactly you do with her. And obviously we're going to take more time to think about that as we continue to sort through the aftermath of this fateful day. Final thing, Camila and I are getting set up to send out the Nehemiah books that we are getting printed. The printing is delayed for whatever reason. And so I feel pressure and stress because I really want to get that mailed out to everybody who supports the podcast at any level on any platform. I want you to have that book before we start Nehemiah, but also, hey, I'm going to do the number of episodes on Esther that I'm going to do on Esther. So hopefully at times outright, hopefully you will have that in your hand. The day we start the next season with a little bonus thing that I am putting together that is going to go in there that I keep teasing, but that is also going to be part of the fun. So that is coming. I've said it before. I'll say it again. Please make sure that is everything is up to date, your address is in all of that because whatever day that shipment of little field notebooks for Nehemiah comes in, I'm going to start sending them out immediately. So having addresses or whatever up to date would be awesome. So we make sure that you get it. Alright, thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
