Well that is because I am dealing with a frustration that involves you and me and we're going to have to deal with it together. Perhaps this is your first time here and you're thinking I don't understand why people listen to this program or why it has so many positive reviews because the host sounds so very very angry and I'm with you new listener. I understand why you would be concerned or put off by this tone but I think when I explain to you what has happened you'll understand why this tone was necessary today. First a bit of history. Earlier this season a season on the book of Galatians the fifth season in the history of this podcast a podcast in which we choose a book of the Bible and then we chip away at a little bit each day and just whatever comes up next and that book of the Bible is what we talk about next and we try to have a nice time and we try to take some ground and we try to do something fruitful here we try to make the Bible a part of your daily rhythm so this is a nice podcast we're supposedly nice things we're supposed to happen earlier this season the season on Galatians I received a white elephant gift from someone in my life that white elephant gift was a small figurine depicting a cherub like child wearing a snow onesie in a delightful snowy idyllic pose it was perhaps ceramic porcelain I don't know what this material is is baked clay and this line of cherished knickknacks are called snow babies I don't want a snow baby I'm not a snow baby guy that's not the kind of thing that would appeal to me I like lumberjack things I chop wood I play sports I fly fish I don't want snow babies what if somebody gives me a snow baby and then later before I have a chance to throw it away or burn it somebody comes into my office and sees that do you think that's going to improve their level of respect for me or diminish it I'll answer it for you diminish it so I received this snow baby I was disgusted by it as obviously I should have been I talked about it on the program because we share a lot of our burdens together and I ended up giving the snow baby away to one of the supporters of this program so that it would be gone from me and whatever monkeys paw curse might reside upon it would now befall the household of that unwitting supporter of the program so I in a gesture of trust and goodwill tell you the listeners to this program that I don't like snow babies what then happens what you would think everybody would look for snow babies say thrift stores or garage sales and just buy them and dispose of them as obviously ought to be done but that's not what's happened at all instead many of you think it would be funny to buy snow babies and various different charming Americana poses and send them to me at my mailing address which is 3213 West main number 101 Rapid City South Dakota 57702 now given the knowledge you all have that I don't like these I can't imagine why someone would send me one it's some sort of misguided prank but guess what keeps showing up at my house I go to my mailbox I'm hoping to find maybe a friendly greeting card with a serene image of perhaps a beach somewhere with an inspirational Bible verse on it that would be good no no no I just keep getting snow babies here's one it's called icicle treat it's got a little baby wrapped up in a snow suit onesie holding an icicle licking it sniffing it praying to it hard to tell it's not great but here it sits on top of a giant clay snowball right here on my desk here's another one this one doesn't have a name looks like it's officer police cop this little snow baby is wearing an old style blue hat that a police officer might wear you know what's in this little snow baby's hands this little snow baby wearing mittens all gussied up for a day out in the cold an American flag that's right a real functioning waving American flag you send this to me you give this to me now I'm responsible for the maintenance of that replica American flag even though it's small flag code still applies you've given me a burden what do I have here oh why it's another snow baby given to me by a listener of this program this one has a hose stuck in a pail the pail is labeled water the hose which is a ridiculously large nazled hose in the style that old timey firefighters might use is being wielded clumsily by surprise a cherubic baby wrapped up in some sort of snowy onesie and this snow baby is wearing a red firefighting helmet what's this in my right hand oh it's another snow baby holding a snow globe that has a penguin in it if I shake it up what happens oh that's right it's a functioning snow globe it's a knickknack within a knickknack now one thing I particularly appreciated about this snow baby is that the head has come detached perhaps that happened in shipping but I prefer to believe that this happened and did some sort of meta play on the entire situation and the entire ongoing series of mockeries and humiliations that I'm enduring at the hands of those of you I try to serve with this Bible podcast let me just be abundantly clear I don't want your snow babies I am repulsed and disgusted every time I open one of these boxes I'm not tickled I'm not going to talk about it every time one comes in and describe it into this microphone as some sort of ongoing bit or joke to build camaraderie and have fun here that's low brow internet that's low brow podcasting we don't do that kind of thing around here so let me just make it clear once and for all this is not funny this is not charming this isn't the kind of joke I appreciate and I'm not staring at these and thinking about what kind of knickknack shelf to build for them to display them in an ironic reverse flip joke play on the entire situation no no no rather I'm just plotting how best to dispose of them Galatians 5 what am I doing I'm in revelation why would I be in revelation well we were doing the sin list thing I'm in Revelation 22 for those of you don't know I read all the lists of all the sin lists the big combo lists of all the bad things very bad things the acts of the flesh that happened in the entire New Testament if this is your first time here you missed all of that but that's what we've done for the last week it's pretty amazing there we go Galatians 5 we got a sin list it says the acts of the sinful nature are obvious sexual immorality impurity and debauchery idolatry in witchcraft hatred discord jealousy fits of rage selfish ambition dissensions factions and envy drunkenness orgies and the like I warn you as I did before that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God we've been a long time on this sin list here and mercifully we're done we worked the whole thing through very carefully we didn't necessarily work it through like breaking down each bad thing on the bad list to get a really good sense of how it's bad and to be like tell me more about exactly what salacious badness that one is break it down describe it in more graphic detail so I can better understand how bad it is no we didn't do that rather we just tried to work through why is this the list why I mean this isn't an exhaustive list here in Galatians 5 of all of the bad things the stuff that is born out of the desires the impulses the state of being the dark side rather this is a list that we have here in Galatians 5 that has a lot of overlap with other lists as we discussed yesterday throughout the New Testament but this is the list that made sense given the problems the Galatians were having to say you know these are the things you guys seem to particularly struggle with here's the list but there's this one the line at the end I warn you as I did before that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God that creates an apparent conflict for the attentive reader because just here in the previous pages of Galatians over here a couple pages and Ephesians there's a lot of language that seems to indicate that right standing with God is a gift of God that faith is a gift of God that salvation is the gift of God and that ultimately that gift of God is not earned through exemplary behavior but rather our right standing with God our pivot from being slaves to death outsiders to the kingdom to being included as sons daughters heirs agents of the king that pivot is the result of God's grace God is the author of salvation God is the one who opens eyes it's a heavy concept it's a lot to deal with we're not used to this equation and every time we come across this as we work our way through the Bible there's something in our sense of what is fair and how things ought to work that is jolted by the reality that God is the giver of life that this is the one thing in life that we don't earn we don't buy we don't manipulate to get it we don't work the system to get it we don't politic hard enough to have our group receive this blessing from on high from the state nope this is a totally different equation than anything ever salvation is through Christ by faith the gift of God so that nobody can boast so then every now and then when we come across a line like this it can be a little bit jarring as well because this line here at the end of Galatians the act of the sinful nature the acts of the flesh list that I just read here in Galatians 5 21 it kind of sounds like maybe you do earn it I warn you as I did before that those who live like this that's the list of very bad things will not inherit the kingdom of God in fact hey you remember earlier when I was open to Revelation 22 from the end of the day doesn't that one kind of sound the same way um behold I'm coming soon this is Jesus talking my reward is with me and I will give to everyone according to what he has done I'm the alpha and the omega the first and the last at the beginning and the end and then there's the list of stuff so what's the relationship here the book of James explores this quite a bit and I think James might be a book that you and I might want to tackle in the not too distant future it deals with this particular question what's the relationship between the gift of right standing with God that is given only by God according to the scriptures and obeying God after that and while the book of Galatians tackles some of that I was talking with my close personal friend Jeff Foote who does the music and the editing on this podcast and we're trying to think like what's the most concise way to sum up sort of a broad new testament view of the relationship between obeying God and not continuing to indulge the sinful nature and things like that and salvation by grace and I do not remember exactly how he turned the phrase but it was a very good distillation it was tighter than my own he said something like hang on a second I don't I don't remember I'm just gonna ask him hang on he'll know Hello Jeffrey hello what's up oh hey buddy I have you on the phone with everyone from the internet okay they say hi remember we were talking about the Galatians five thing about the the verse I warn you as I did before that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God and we were having a contest to figure out who could say it tighter the relationship between obeying God and good works and God's free gift of salvation and you won what was your phrase it's about like identity you said it really well oh man what's it like it was our identity our behavior does that create our identity but our identity is shown through our behavior yeah that's why you won that was better and mine was like three times longer than that okay so then if that's the case then what we're talking about here is that when we get these passages that are like well if you're doing all the stuff on the sin list you're an outsider to the kingdom of God what we're talking about here is the idea that if if this is the defining stuff of you that is an indicator of your true identity which is not someone who has life by the spirit is that a fair statement of what your maximum here is communicating yeah what's going to keep you out of the kingdom or get you into the kingdom is your identity not your behavior but you will recognize the identity of the people based on their behavior in the end or God will be able to see through all of that when he sorts it out correct yeah well and that's how Paul's creating an In Galatians 5 right these are identity markers these aren't necessarily just a simple naughty and nice list hey guys try to do more of this don't do this I mean that's kind of implicit in it but from the perspective of the larger argument and point of the letter he's trying to say these are the hallmarks of the flesh the honest impulses of the flesh the darker impulses of the flesh the slave to the law aspect of the flesh but this stuff the beautiful stuff these are hallmarks these are indicators that you are in Christ this is what life by the spirit looks like in one of the list you had in an episode about in these ways you used to flock it and call himself right what was it he used to walk what was his behavior before the Damascus Road incident so I think the argument in Galatians is it's the internal it's the identity that needs to be fixed and that's only fixed by 50 and you don't do that by fixing the outside external through circumcision or whatever so similarly once that identity has shaped and been changed now this is how we live this is what it looks like to be a part of this new thing with the spirit so it's just kind of equipping or explaining to the people before when your identity was X your behavior was X now that your identity is Y the behavior will follow to look like Y okay and same question that I've asked you at other times what if it doesn't every now and then like what if somebody who demonstrates a whole bunch of the fruit of the spirit also engages in I'm just gonna close my eyes and circle my pen and drop on the previous list dissensions while it was right between dissensions and drunkenness what if that still happens at some point what does that mean for their eternal fate I don't think it detracts anything from the new creation or the new identity if we don't behave consistently with it I think over the landscape of your life by the power of the spirit you will see the simple list reduced in the fruit of the spirit that's increased but it's not a one-to-one correlation because I did something foolish or fleshly or stupid or sinful what I want to call it that somehow I'm kind of kicked out because I got in my faith not behavior so my behaviors are not going to kick me out perfect I'm glad I called you your your maxim was way better than mine and everybody just got roughly the seven minutes of their life back that I wasted on snow babies at the beginning of this conversation because we had you just say what the maxim was dude I keep getting have we not talked to I keep getting snow babies I just got three more snow babies today so people think that's funny apparently that should be on the list of the acts of the sinful nature sending people snow babies when they say they don't like them you should have told everybody that you don't like I don't know if I ain't baseball is my Hall of Famers or bars of gold what yeah okay just Jeff just added out the part where you gave me that suggestion okay you know Jeff the one thing I really hate are bars of gold then sign baseballs by Hall of Famers every time I get something like that I'm like ah stupid gold this is the worst the worst podcast yet here we are okay that was fruitful thanks for picking up Jeffrey that was helpful enjoy editing anytime all right see you buddy thank goodness for Jeff Foot where would we be without him he just makes everything better around here for those of you who are new he does all the music that you hear here it's all by Jeff he's a good dude all right I think that's plenty for today we're actually gonna start reading things from the good list tomorrow and I said that like nine times but there's always been a reason tomorrow we're actually gonna read things from the good list and it's gonna be fun all right it's plenty a mat this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast do this again soon", "segments": [{"id":
