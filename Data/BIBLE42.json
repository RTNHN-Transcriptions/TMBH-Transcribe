    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Luke. It's crazy that Luke contributed as much to the New Testament as he did. He wrote two huge books. One of them is the Gospel of Luke that we're talking about today. It's the third of the four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And then he wrote a sequel to that book called Acts, which is the fifth book in the New Testament. And it's the history of what happened with the early church. But not only did Luke write these two huge books, but also he contributed by word count more to the New Testament than anybody else. I would have guessed it was Paul before I found out that little fact. But no, it's Luke, north of 25% of the New Testament comes from Luke. And the reason that's crazy, well, there are a lot of reasons. Maybe the number one reason that doesn't seem to make sense on paper is that Luke is a Gentile. He's the only Gentile contributor to this whole thing. And that really stands out because this has been a very Jewish affair to this point. Jesus is Jewish. It's all happening in Galilee, in Judea, in Jerusalem. All of the disciples are Jewish. But Luke, he's from somewhere up north. He's not a prophet. He's not trained theologically, at least not in any formal way, like, say, Paul or some others. He's not a professional historian. Either he's a doctor. And so both by ethnicity and profession is just pretty wild that he ended up doing as much Bible writing as he ended up doing. Also, it's kind of awesome that he's both of those things. One, the Gentile thing is awesome because it undergirds the theological theme of the Bible that this always was for the Jews and for the Gentiles. But the second reason that I think who Luke is is pretty awesome considering his role is the way his mind is wired. He's a man of science. He's a man of detail. Luke says at the beginning of his gospel and then at the beginning of its sequel, the Book of Acts, that he set out to write an ordered account of all of these things and that he was going to go and do actual interviews, or that he did go and do these actual interviews with actual people, talked with eyewitnesses to piece the whole thing together. Now Matthew leaned very heavily on the words of Jesus and of the Old Testament to try to convince his Jewish brothers and sisters that Jesus was the long-promised king. And I think he did an excellent job. Mark leaned very heavily on the actions of Jesus to try to convince his Roman friends that Jesus was indeed the Messiah. And now Luke is going to lean very heavily into the clinical details of all of this stuff to try to convince a larger Gentile audience, maybe a Greek-minded audience, of the same thing Luke had become convinced of. That Jesus of Nazareth was innocent of the charges against him that led to his execution, that he is indeed the Messiah and that he's the fulfillment of everything in history, including the Old Testament. Luke is convinced this is for everyone, but clearly he also believed that it needed to be relayed in a certain way to make it make sense to a portion of the audience that he was sympathetic to who might not track with that more heavily Roman perspective or that more heavily Jewish perspective of the Gospels that might have already been floating around out there. Well after Luke goes around and does all this research and gathers all these interviews, he decides that the best way to organize the story of Jesus is to divide it into three geographic scenes with a little prologue on the beginning about the birth of Jesus. The first scene, which is the first roughly third of the book happens all up north and the relatively safe confines of Galilee, then the middle scene is all transitional as we go from way up north to down south in Jerusalem, which is where the third scene happens. So it's kind of a three-act road trip story with massively important events happening all along the way. But that birth prologue on the front end is probably the most famous and memorable thing that we get from the Book of Luke, just as a function of how often we hear it because of Christmas. That nativity story that we're all so familiar with, it comes from Luke with a degree of detail that we don't get in the other Gospels. And in that opening prologue, we learn about two miraculous births. One is that promised forerunner of Jesus, this Elijah who is to come. This is John the Baptist. It's the cousin of Jesus and the son of a guy named Zechariah and a lady named Elizabeth. And then obviously the second birth is the miraculous virgin birth of Jesus of Nazareth himself, this king who was promised. And in the opening prologue, which is a couple chapters long, we get four beautiful poems or songs that lean super heavily. And that old testament language that you and I just spent so much time looking at about who this king will be and what this king will accomplish and how people respond to this king. And the beautiful stuff that is to come out of it, maybe the most famous of those songs is toward the end of chapter one. It's often nicknamed the Magnificat and that comes from Mary, Jesus' mother. And she says, my soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior. For he's been mindful of the humble state of his servant from now on all generations will call me blessed. For the mighty one has done great things for me. Holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him from generation to generation. He's performed mighty deeds with his army, scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He's brought down rulers from their thrones, but has lifted up the humble. He's filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he has said to our fathers. That is so theologically significant as connective tissue between everything about the old story and everything that's about to happen now. Remember, Luke thinks Jesus is the fulfillment of everything that's come before. And by latching onto this language from Mary, he has the reader anticipating just how Jesus is going to be the fulfillment of all of this stuff. In Luke chapter four, Jesus is in a synagogue. He opens up a scroll and reads from the prophet Isaiah. He reads the following words there. He says, the spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. And he rolls up the scroll and he says, today, this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing. He's not being shy about who he is and what he's there to do, especially emphasizing that justice theme that we see throughout all the prophecies in the Old Testament about what the Messiah is going to do. He's going to straighten out the stuff that's upside down and weird and wrecked and stupid. And Jesus doesn't shy away from that aspect of things. And he certainly doesn't shy away from letting people rightly recognize that, no, he's in so many words, more explicitly all the time demonstrating himself to be the Messiah. Well, just like in Matthew and Mark, some people like it. Some people don't know what to make of it. And some people are very, very angry. Much like in Matthew, Jesus has a big block of teaching while he's still up north. And in that he lays out the values of his kingdom. And this kingdom is one where justice happens. And it's not a worldly notion of justice. The values are upside down. It's the opposite of how the world thinks about things. And this is very compelling to the people up north. And probably, given what we see in the first nine chapters of Luke, he could have just stayed up there and made a gigantic movement. Maybe even got people to get swords and stuff and kill some Romans or overthrow something. But he doesn't. He insists on turning his face resolutely toward Jerusalem and going to face down what needs to happen there. Now, just like in Mark and in Matthew, there's a moment where the disciples realize that he is indeed the Messiah. And just like in Matthew and Mark, Jesus chases that by saying, I am going to go die in Jerusalem at the hands of the chief of God. The hands of the chief priests, the teachers of the law, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the religious leaders. And then I'm going to be raised back to life by my father on the third day. This is what has to happen. And so it's a pretty dramatic moment when Jesus then turns his face resolutely toward Jerusalem and starts in that direction. So the way Luke has it structured now, there's this calamity on the other end of this road trip. And you can tell this is a one way ticket, but along the way, Jesus meets so many people and he's eating with people who like him and he has these dramatic confrontations. And he tells amazing stories, including the stuff in chapter 15, where Jesus is eating food with tax collectors and social outcasts and the Pharisees are there as well, complaining about it. I mean, what a wild room that must have been. And Jesus starts talking. And he tells this story about this lost sheep and this good shepherd who leaves all the other ones behind to go and find the one who is lost. This is very central to how Jesus is presented in Luke as the one who comes to seek and save the lost. But then that theme of lost and found continues throughout this moment in Luke 15, where he goes on to talk about a lost coin being found, but most famously of all, a lost son being found. And the warm reception that the father who the son betrayed and insulted, the warm reception that that father gives him. It's really one of the most beautiful stirring images and stories in the entire Bible. Well, by the end of chapter 19, Jesus has made his way to Jerusalem. It's a very emotional thing for the people who receive him, but it's emotional for him as well. He knows why he's there. He knows that Jerusalem is rejecting him and he knows that his people have rejected God time and time again. And now they're about to engage in the ultimate rejection of the will of God and the work of God. As it is in Matthew and Mark, Jesus lays out for his disciples in broad strokes how things are going to unfold for the realization of the kingdom moving forward into history. And then after that, Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper is arrested and Luke really goes out of his way to point out the shenanigans that went on in getting this conviction. The actual authority figures, they just don't see Jesus guilt, but the religious leaders are like, no, he is guilty. We will accept nothing other than his execution. And Jesus ends up going to the cross. And Luke gives us a couple of those memorable stories from the cross where Jesus is actively verbally forgiving the people and asking God to forgive the people who are murdering him unjustly. And Jesus is there on the cross between two criminals and even in all that pain thinks of the one who reaches out to him and assures the guy that today that criminal will be with Jesus in paradise. In the closing chapter of Luke, we get the victory over death. Jesus is raised from the dead, but we get way more detail about it than Mark gives us where Mark seems to cut the story off early to leave some ambiguity and tension for his Roman audience to consider for themselves. Luke really spells it out. He gives us way more details about Jesus' resurrection and this amazing scene where he meets some of his disciples who are grieving on the road and they don't immediately recognize him because he's back to life. That's kind of confusing and disorienting. But then he opens the eyes of these disciples to the scriptures and how Jesus is the fulfillment and the completion of all of that. And then Jesus promises them the arrival of the Holy Spirit and descends into heaven. And that's where the book of Acts, the sequel to Luke, is going to pick up. I love this book. I've read it a bunch of times. It's just my opinion. But I think Luke wildly succeeds in his objectives in trying to give us this ordered account and trying to show us that Jesus was innocent and in trying to show us that he fulfills all of that stuff that came before and is the bringer of justice and straightening things out. Not just to the Jewish people, but to people like Luke, Gentiles, people who God has always had in view. And now that is all coming to fruition. When you visualize the book of Luke, picture that in a tivity scene. When you think about the theme, reflect on the innocent son of man. That's Jesus coming to seek and save the lost. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you get Luke 15 like we talked about. Also get Luke 1910 where Jesus spells it out that the son of man came to seek and save the lost. And then also make sure to get that beautiful resurrection passage in all of Luke chapter 24. And with that, we got our Luke achievement unlocked. Last of the gospels, John next time around. A mat.
