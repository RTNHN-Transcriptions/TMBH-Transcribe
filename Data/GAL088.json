Were they guileless innocent, so we're just sitting there, minding their own business, being good Christians, and then some monsters came along, and poured poison in their ears, and they believed all of it, and they got bewitched, and they didn't even mean to, and they were under the spell of bad people, maybe. Or were they malicious malcontents who didn't like the way being Christians was working out, and they wanted something different, and they were bored of doing things God's way, and through the grace of Jesus, and so instead they went out looking for trouble, and they found it, they found a competing message, a competing gospel, and then they slurped it up like ravenous pigs at the theology slop trough. That was pretty good. I actually really like the way that sounded. Well, today we're going to find out, and the way we're going to get to the bottom of things, when we really want to know an answer is, don't ask me. We're going to go in here from other smarter people, and see what they made of this question of how we're to conceive of the Galatians, whether this was something that happened to them, they were bewitched and bedeviled, or whether this is something that they inflicted upon themselves intentionally with eyes wide open. And I want to see if any of these great minds of the past who have written about the book of Galatians, over the millennia, have anything to say about the nature of the bewitching that Paul references here in Galatians chapter 3, verse 1. You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you before your very eyes, Jesus Christ, was clearly portrayed as crucified. We'll see if anybody thinks that it was actual bewitching with spells or witchcraft or incantations or tinctures or whatnot. So we're going to start with some smart people who chimed in here over on the Patreon side, and I got a brilliant comment from Tara, the patron who wrote, I agree with the implication at the end there that the scary spellcasting brand of being bewitched and the more mundane led astray through clever rhetoric bewitched are not really that dissimilar at all to your point that Paul's context merges paganism and intellectualism, perhaps more than we would anticipate. Likewise, I think our context has artificially separated them more than we recognize, and the rest of the comment is equally as brilliant. You can go over to Patreon. I think I have this conversation set to public, so even if you're not a member supporting the show, you can sort of read the comment because what Tara had to say was real smart. So I guess Tara is saying bewitched is bewitched either way. It doesn't matter if there's a magic spell or not. The effect is the same. Good take. Carol weighed in with where I kind of wondered if your brains might go. It's where mine secretly went a little bit too. When I hear the word bewitched, I immediately think of the song bewitched bewildered and be wondered. I also think about the TV series bewitched, and Jeff didn't disappoint. He sneaked that right in. I really liked what Carol had to say right here though. She said, I think about that scene in Pride and Prejudice 2005 when Darcy says to Elizabeth, quote, you have bewitched me body and soul. The word bewitched has never had a sinister undertone for me. I guess I'm just from a different generation. That's a great take, Carol. And if I thought of that quote, that would have been the way I would introduce the whole conversation. You're doing this better than I'm doing. Dr. Kevin Eager, who is a brilliant man who has been kind enough to come and hang out with me over on my other podcast with my buddy Destin called Notum Questions. He weighs in and says, yeah, when Matt said, quote, when you hear the word bewitched, do you think of one of two things? I was convinced one of those things was going to be bewitched, the TV sitcom, and it's theme song. That's what I had in my head glad to hear it was in Jeff's outro though. Jeff is the real highlight around here, isn't he? He knows how to dress this thing up. Okay, those are great takes. Thank you. I think the consensus there is that I'm not hearing from you that you think that this is a spell or an incantation necessarily, but that the effect on the mind is the same. Also the 60s television sitcom bewitched is charming and I can't argue with you there. Let's see what smart people from ages past had to say. People's Spurgeon famous 19th century preacher, maybe the famousist 19th century preacher. He wrote a little exposition on the book of Galatians. This is what he has to say. These Galatians thought they were very philosophical Spurgeon writes and very intellectual, but the apostle says, oh, foolish Galatians. They thought that they'd been led by reason and guided by the learning of their teachers, but Paul calls it witchery, quote, who have bewitched you? He asks. And if anything, which led a man to trust in his own work should be as much abhorred as the incantations of a witch, quote, who hath bewitched you? It's a dangerous state. It's a devilish snare to be brought into to be led to trust to frames and feelings and experiences and doings and praying or anything else with Christ. Spurgeon goes on. It's a strange thing that those who've seen Christ should ever go back to these things. Lord, keep us every day amongst our other sins from our own self-righteous nature. The might take away from that is Spurgeon is saying that maybe they didn't go looking for trouble, but their pride and hubris set them up for it for imagining themselves to be very intellectual and very eager to hear all of the latest teachings and ideas. They set themselves up to be rubbish. And by imagining we would never fall for something as so simple and low minded and primitive for the normal types as witchcraft. They walked right into it. I thought that was a really interesting contrast or really interesting. All right. So, up. Martin Luther, he's the guy at the front end of the Protestant Reformation in the particularly the early half of the 1500s in Germany. And this is a guy who, as I understand it, pretty famously tipped his hand to believing that there were things like forest, sprites and creatures. I think he believed that witchcraft was a real thing and that somehow it was very connected to the stuff of the devil. So I'm interested to hear what he has to say. There's no question the Paul is disappointed, Luther writes. It hurts him to think that his Galatians showed so little stability. We can hear him say, quote, I'm sorry to hear of your troubles and disappointed in you for the disgraceful part you played. Aha. So Luther's take is that it's both that these are things that happened to them. And also they participated pretty knowingly in what went wrong. I think that's often a very fair take on how most sin or shortcoming happens in life. I think sin is something that happens to us. It's just that because of our nature, we're very often, I'm very often willing to cooperate with it happening to me. A certain distance and coolness Luther goes on can be noted in the title with which the apostle addresses the Galatians. He doesn't now address them as his brethren, as he usually does. He addresses them as Galatians in order to remind them of their national trait to be foolish. Now because of the time Luther was writing, I assume that he held the North Galatian theory. That was pretty much the only one that was popular in his time. So I mean, that is the theory that the Galatian churches were in the northern half of that hourglass that is the province or region of Galatia as we talked about a while back. And that Paul would have founded that church invisibly, extra biblically in his second missionary journey. And that means that he would think that the Galatians were Gauls who had moved there and colonized that area 300 years before the writing of Galatians. And it also means that Luther would have imagined that the Gauls took with them all of their central or Western European paganism that the Romans encountered when they met the Gauls back in the day, when they were practicing that looked more like something you might imagine in like a Celtic pagan witchcraft kind of sense. I think it's a pretty safe bet that what Luther is saying here is, all right, these are the old pagan Gauls. And what Paul is doing here is he's referencing back to their roots. He's like, you're still this. This is still in your blood. And he's reminding them of that by calling them Gauls by calling them Galatians. Luther goes on, what we have here is an example of bad traits that often cling to individual Christians and entire congregations. Grace does not suddenly transform a Christian into a new and perfect creature. Things of the old and natural corruption remain. All right, he goes on, Paul calls the Galatians foolish and bewitched in the fifth chapter. He mentioned sorcery among the works of the flesh. That's still to come in the book of Galatians declaring that witchcraft and sorcery are real manifestations and legitimate activities of the devil. We're all exposed to the influence of the devil because he is the prince and God of the world in which we live lower case G. Satan is clever. He does not only bewitched men in a crude manner, but also in a more artful fashion. He be devils the minds of men with hideous fallacies. Not only is he able to deceive the self assured, but even those who profess the true Christian faith, there's not one among us who's not at times seduced by Satan into false beliefs. But now Luther's going to soften on the Galatians a little bit. He says, it's as if Paul were saying, quote, I know your defection was not willful. The devil sent the false apostles to you and they tallied you into believing that you are justified by the law. With this our epistle, we endeavor to undo the damage which the false apostles have inflicted upon you. Since the devil has this uncanny ability to make us believe a lie until we would swear a thousand times it were the truth, we must not be proud, but walk in fear and humility and call upon the Lord Jesus to save us from temptation. Though I am a doctor of divinity and have preached Christ and fought his battles for a long time, I know from personal experience how difficult it is to hold fast to the truth. I cannot always shake off Satan. I cannot always apprehend Christ as the scriptures portray him. Sometimes the devil distorts Christ to my vision, but thanks be to God who keeps us in his word and faith and in prayer. The spiritual witchery of the devil creates in the heart a wrong idea of Christ. Those who share the opinion that a person is justified by the works of the law are simply bewitched. Their belief goes against faith and Christ. Huh, I was just going to read you one little bit from Luther, but he was kicking butt and making so much sense. I guess I carried away and just kept going. It seems like he would say that there is culpability both ways. The Galatians have ownership of this, but it seems like he's more willing to say. They really were bewitched by something satanic from the devil. Apostles of the devil sent to fool them and trick them and deceive them. And whether it was by some sort of pagan incantation or not, it doesn't seem like he's suggesting that it was. They still got duped by the spiritual forces of darkness, but then he goes on to say, hey, you know, it can happen to anybody. It could happen to me. And I went to school for this stuff. So let's remain humble and thank God for his grace that he can fix this kind of error and this kind of mistake that the devil brings upon us and that we are sometimes all too eager to cooperate with. Pretty good stuff there from Martin Luther. It's almost as though that guy is real smart and there's a reason everybody still knows his name 500 years after the fact. Well, I'm having fun, but I'm going to need another day to go and listen to what the smart people of ages past said about how I'm supposed to understand the Galatians and what happened to them here. And I did go and find more books in there in front of me. And I want to read more of these excerpts to you. And I think this is really fun and different from a lot of the things we normally do, which means that tomorrow our Christmas episode, as I'm recording this, is going to be all about the great minds of the Christian past talking to us about how the Galatians got bedeviled and be whiched. Why not? We just do it in real time. We take what we get. However, speaking of Christmas, I do have a little bonus video that I want to share with those of you who are supporting the program and making this thing happen. So if you support on Patreon, it'll be up over there by the time you hear this message. And if you support the program through one of the other avenues like Planning Center, it'll be in your email when you hear this. Whether you go and watch my little video or not, the point is thank you all so much for being a part of this thing. Thank you for indulging these weird rabbit trails that I want to take us on. I love that we can go as deep into this thing as we want. And we can take the time that we need to take to chip away at it and chase after each little curiosity that comes up and run that down because we don't have to solve it tomorrow. We've got a minute to work on this thing together. So if you're one of the ones who sports thing, thank you so much for doing that. If you're one of the ones who are here listening to this, thank you so much for doing that. I'm so glad we get to be together. And if you are listening to this in real time, I hope you have a fantastic Christmas. All right, that's plenty for now. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
