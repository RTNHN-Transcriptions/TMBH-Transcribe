I have one job here. It's to think of song lyrics that go with what you're trying to tell me that's important and then I sing it and I ruin it. And the lyrics were from the Little Mermaid, the original one with the great big seawitch when she's singing about stuff. And I don't even remember what prompted it. It doesn't matter. The point is, apparently I remember every single word of that song and the rhythms and the little affectations. So I had a lovely time. My son was mortified. But in that song, what you get is the monkey's paw. You get the deal with the devil where it seems like things are going to be great, the Little Mermaid. She's going to get her people legs because flipping your fins, you don't get so far and she's going to get the legs and she's going to go and she's going to find Eric the Prince and she's going to make him fall in love with her and it's going to be amazing. And it just feels like, wow, that's weird because this giant tentacled weird seawitch lady who squishes living organisms into lipstick and has two hideous eels named after things that are left in the water after a shipwreck. It just seems like she'd be a bad person, but this deal is great. The Little Mermaid gets to be a person and pursue love. Everything is wonderful. But then you listen a little bit more to the song and you realize there's two guy to be trout, some monkeys paw. She's going to take your voice and then she's going to wreck everything and sabotage at all. And we're getting that here in the Book of Esther because it looks like it's just going to be this great thing. But then you realize that there's another side to this coin and it's a really ugly other side to this coin because Esther is getting pampered and she's getting taken care of. She's the bell of the ball. She's the sweetheart of the whole contest. The people who are running the contest seem to want her to win. They even went so far as to go and get seven people who work around the king's bedroom and private daily life who would see and hear everything to give Esther the inside track on all of it. And as if that wasn't enough here in verse 12, we learned that it's even more elaborate and beautiful and opulent and pampering than we had thought at first. It goes like this. Before a girl's turn came to go into King Xerxes, she had to complete 12 months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women. Six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics. And this is how she would go to the king. Anything she wanted was given to her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace. It's so romantic. It's so exciting. It's 12 months of spa treatment. I have no idea how that works now. So I double have no idea how that worked back then. But six months for cosmetics and six months for perfume. I mean, it sounds like the people who are running this are really wanting the pleasant sense of those perfumes to go deeper than skin deeply. We're going to apply this long enough that it soaks all the way in. He's permanently smell like whatever flavor we've decided that you're going to smell like. I don't know. This is awesome. And she would have smelled so much better than your regular run of the mill lady out just walking around. I mean, six months of each of these things. Is it possible that after a woman received this kind of treatment, you would always be able to tell that she at least at one point had been noble and elite? I mean, if somebody would receive this treatment, went out and about in town, you'd be able to tell the difference between them and a commoner just by the way they smelled. And as if all of that isn't good enough, then on top of that, you get anything you want to take with you to the king. I don't think that means like gold or silver stuff like that. I think the king kind of owned all of that for himself, probably had all that he needed. I think the idea is you could take one thing with you that is emblematic of your service to the king or something that the king would be charmed by or enjoy. Read into that however you want. And so all of that just sounds absolutely magical, including getting to pick your one gift. I mean, there's something out of the bachelor or something like, and my gift that I chose for Blake is this. But then you get the monkeys, Pauvers 14 in the evening. She would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shashghaz, the king's unit who was in charge of the concubines. So on the night then, when it's time to actually go and spend a night in the bedroom of the king, because this pageant, by the way, it wasn't going to happen like noon on a Tuesday. This was an evening pageant and it was apparently largely unsupervised. So you go and you take your one thing that you get to take with to the king's palace and you get that one night. And then after that, in the morning, you return to another part of the harem to the care of Shashghaz, the king's unit who's in charge of the concubines. Now that's a different word. The concubine, there's your monkey's paw. You don't want to end up on the concubine list because that means that you are used up by the king and you don't get to go and marry anybody else. You don't get to go do anything. You don't get to go out and about in town or in the community. You are just forever marked by and for the king because the king doesn't share. I don't think anybody listening to this is like, oh man, that really surprised me. I thought being a concubine would be a great outcome. I think we all know it's not a desirable outcome, but the ground rules we are being told here is that you're going to get pretty up. You're going to get all of this stuff and it seems like you're getting this great thing, but it's kind of like you're being fattened up for the slaughter too because unless you are that one lady, the king picks, you are going to be relegated to the concubine circle forever and it's kind of just a pretty person prison. I'm guessing it was a horrible, miserable place and one of the details of it is you have no shot unless your name gets specifically called of having any taste of the most valuable thing in the kingdom, which is proximity to and access to the king so close and yet so far and forever. You just sit there, I guess, kicking yourself, wondering what you could have done different, what you could have done better, what you should have said. Did he not like this? Did he not like that? Did I joke too much? Did I ask too many questions? Did I laugh too hard? Did I seem too eager for the rest of your life if you were a woman who did not get chosen and the majority would not, you would sit in that circle of concubines, basically a prison wondering what you got wrong that one time when you were like 18. So this might seem like every little Persian girl's dream but it's a monkey's paw. There's another side to this and the other side is very ugly and that ugly fate is what most of these girls are going to have to look forward to unless, of course, I mean, there could be an exception. If the king asked for you by name, you would get taken back out of the minor league pool of the concubines and you would get to go back and be with the king for another night or until he was sick of you. How many names do you think Xerxes, the king of kings, the king of lands is going to remember? Does he seem like the kind of guy who's going to remember all of these girls names or does he seem like the kind of guy who's going to be on a date with somebody? He's met a couple of times and then takes her to Starbucks because he forgot her name and he knows that they'll have to write her name on the cup and call it out loud and bail himself out. He's not going to remember. He's a key-minute king's had to hire a guy to be like, hey, remind me to punish Athens and defeat the Greeks according to Herodotus. They couldn't even remember the Greeks and that's not like one person. That's a lot of people. It's a whole civilization. If he can forget the name of a whole civilization without hiring somebody to remind him of it at every meal, he's going to forget the name of that one girl he was with that one time out of the gajillion girls that he's been with. This seems like a beautiful fantasy come true, an amazing romantic blissful thing, but I got to imagine that hundreds, maybe thousands of young girls' dreams were absolutely dashed against the rocks and they were relegated to a horrible, lonely, loveless fate as a result of the indifference of the king and the cruelty of this system. So now that we know this, we are entering into a different stage of the game. It's not just what can Esther get? How high can she climb? Rather, the rules are now clarified as being that if she doesn't beat out all of her rivals in her harem class, she has this fate to look forward to. The farthest thing from being positioned where she needs to be positioned for what is coming as this story unfolds. Very high stakes indeed and the decisions about how this all works out and what her fate will be seem really, really arbitrary. Having to do with making some guy happy, she's never, ever met under enormous pressure with no ability to control what mood he might be in or what went on at court that day. This is a very dangerous, very precarious situation for Esther and she is going to have to muster all of her courage and clarity and charm and self-control to avoid a horrible outcome here. Good times! I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
