This is just, I mean, that's what you did when you're growing up in a Christian household in the 80s and 90s. There are all kinds of youth events and everything. And they were pretty fun. I mean, as I've said before, there's plenty to make fun of. Lots of things that are campy or silly now, but really isn't everything from that era easy fodder for just making fun of now. Nothing stays fashionable anymore. We turn over fads really quickly. So whatever you think is cool, right? The second is going to look stupid in a few years and we'll all have a laugh about it. Well, the same thing is true with a bunch of trends and youth Christian things from back then. And we kind of knew even back then that it was a little bit silly, but whatever. I mean, this is what we were around. It's what we experienced. And one of the things that I remember from a lot of those events was that the speakers would get really serious. And so many of them would say, you kids, you're going to pay a great price for following Jesus. This is not popular. You're going to be hated. You're going to be made fun of. People are going to want to fight you. You might not even be able to do business with people if you admit what you believe in public. And we're all very polite and we listened because our parents said to listen to the speakers or whatever. But when they leave, we'd all kind of giggle about that part because we're all going, uh, it's fine being a Christian. We're all pretty out there with our faith or whatever is kids and nobody's mad. All the politicians go to church or at least when the video cameras are rolling and Amy Grant is in the top 40. The God is in the pledge of allegiance. Says God on the money even and John three, 16 is the football games. I don't know. Nobody really seems that mad. Then I can remember a few times in school, people trying to get under my skin, you know, rivals or bullies or whatever, maybe making a comment about church or faith or God or whatever. But I don't know. Back then it wasn't a whole incident. If someone said something mean to you. We didn't have to do any paperwork if somebody was mean and the teacher would maybe talk to you for a second or maybe just fight for a couple minutes. I know that sounds just unthinkable and horrible now, but the fighting was nicer. I think back then is maybe bloody the lip a little bit. Wipe that clean. Now you have each other's respected, dap each other up and you get on with it and you're probably going to be friends after that. If you weren't there, you have no idea what I'm talking about. That sounds just insane. I'm sure. You're like, yeah, that's pretty much how that all went. And so maybe I got yelled at a few times or made fun of a little bit, but it just didn't matter that much. I paid basically no price for being a Christian growing up. It was easy. If anything, it was slightly advantageous to be a Christian when I was growing up. But eventually those guys who yelled about how hard it was going to be to be a Christian, eventually they were kind of vindicated because the world changed. I was going to say a little bit. The world changed a lot. And technology has a lot to do with that. I mean, man, the number of things since I was a kid that had been invented that fundamentally changed the proposition of what it is to be a human to have relationships, how you meet people, how love works, how conversation works, all of that is massively technologically augmented at this point. So we're changing as a species. We're changing as creatures here. And it's all kind of untested and unknown as to where that will go. But somehow along with all of the technology, we've also changed socially. And there are certain things, not even like the obviously potentially divisive social things, but really core philosophical assumptions about humanity and morality that the general political consensus right now, it doesn't square with what the Bible teaches, what God says about the nature of humanity and things like that in the Bible. And so if you're kind of internalizing the kingdom values of the Bible, you are going to come to different conclusions than that, which is popular in the media and on the internet and a lot of political conversations. I mean, kingdom values from the Bible are way more different than world kingdom values now, way more overtly different than they were when I was a kid. And at this point, I don't think there's really a good way to thread the needle. If you really own the Jesus thing and the faith thing, you're going to irritate people. It's all out there for people to see. And it is far more acceptable now for there to be overt hostility toward the general idea of Christian faith than it was when I was a kid. It's just kind of in poor taste to just be generally mad at the idea of Christian faith when I was a kid. Now, I mean, there's lots of people who disagree politically with things that certain Christians might think or disagree about questions of faith who are just nice and charitable and there's no problem. You can all hang out together. But there is a segment who were overtly hostile and you will pay a price for them if you acknowledge who you are or what you think. It's wild. Those guys at camp, I guess they were right. I guess I could just see things that I couldn't see. You know, there is kind of a constant pressure to figure out if you will say and espouse and think things that will make everyone happy. Or if you will say and espouse and think things that sound like kingdom values as best as you can understand them as you try to follow Jesus. Look, nobody follows Jesus perfectly. I'm sure there are things that I think I'm getting right that I'm not getting right. But there is a tension I feel now that I did not feel when I was a kid to have to think through, all right, do I try to please people or do I try to just do what I think is right and think what I think is right? So how much do you admit to like what do you say in front of people? What is shrewd and what is foolish because you will pay a price at this moment in history as I'm recording this episode for thinking societally unapproved things. All of that to say that when I first read the book of Galatians and I used to write down the date in my Bible. So I remember how old I was and where I was and what I was doing when I read these passages. When I first read this in 1991 and then when I read it again, I've got my next Bible here that I had in I read this in apparently February 19th of the year 2000. This is the next time I read this. When I read those back then, I didn't relate to what Paul is saying here at the end of the introduction to the book. He's telling the Galatians that he preached the true message of the gospel to them. They received it enthusiastically. Then other people came along and they cut in. Then other people came along and they screwed it up. And now the Galatians have accepted this false gospel. And Paul says verse 10 of Galatians 1, am I now trying to win the approval of men or of God or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. That did not resonate with me at all because I did not feel any of those pressures when I read this as a kid in 1991 or in the year 2000. But I feel it more now and I think I a little bit better understand where Paul is coming from in that it was him that he's saying, guys, I've put myself out there. I've done the brave thing that so few are willing to do. I've paid the price for it physically. It cost me something significant to deliver you this message and to be persistent. I'm not trying to impress people or score social points. I'm trying to care for your soul. I'm trying to align with Jesus in the truest sense and tell you the true message of who Jesus is, what he's done and what the implications are for you. And you guys received that. And apparently somewhere in the interim, the people who had come and messed with the Galatians and tried to steer them toward a different track and suggested that Paul was maybe going soft that he was trying to impress people or curry favor with people. It sounds to me like that kind of gossip had come back around to Paul and he had heard the charges that he was just trying to score points with people and say what people wanted to hear and Paul no doubt is like, what the heck? What do you want from me? I'm one of the few who's actually paid the price. Now, think about what that would sound like to the Apostle Paul because if we are indeed talking about the Southern half of the hourglass when we talk about the Galatian church, remember how they first responded when Paul went to them and told them the message of the gospel? They tried to sacrifice the bull for Zeus to him. And then when he was like, no, don't do that. They were like, fine, that will hit you with rocks until you appear dead. Remember that's how he met these people. It's not just that someone was mean to Paul because he identified publicly with Christ. They were literally the people. He's writing to are from the community that did that to him. Maybe some of the people hearing this message are the ones who threw the rocks and yet here he is having to remind them, hey guys, just look at the track record here. Do I seem like someone who tries to take the socially easy route to avoid saying hard things to try to make everybody happy so no one will be mean to me or do I seem like the kind of person who just keeps putting it out there and taking the risk, no matter the consequences. Come on. Even if you don't believe the stories from everywhere else, at least remember the stories you were there for and that you were a part of where I was on the receiving end of your literal, not metaphorical rocks. Am I now trying to win the approval of men or of God? Am I trying to please men? If I was still trying to please men, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ. Now, this guy actually did pay a price for believing in Jesus, for talking about the kingdom and the gospel and all of that stuff. I didn't when I was a kid, I would say I still really haven't any terrible extent. I just feel the pressure more now. But Paul, he was one of the real ones and I think it was entirely fair game and appropriate for him to remind this church of that. Thinking of you all, all the best I'm at.
