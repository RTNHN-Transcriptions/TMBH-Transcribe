    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Ephesians. Ephesians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to the church in Ephesus, and it reads way different tonally than what we've seen in 1 Corinthians and in Galatians. It is clear that Paul thinks very highly of this church and that Paul loves this church, and that this church, unlike Corinth, has not been a pain in the butt. Instead, here he feels the opportunity to write a letter that is very forward-looking and very celebratory about what God has done and the role that they have played in it there in Ephesus and what the implications of what God has done in the distant past and in the recent past, what those implications are for whoever's reading this letter moving forward. So this is a very optimistic letter that is not all about fixing stuff that is broken and screwed up and looking backwards. This is forward, forward, forward, hope, hope, hope, and there's a reason this book of the Bible has been beloved by Christians for two millennia. Paul's relationship with the church in Ephesus, which is on the far west coast of modern-day Turkey and was a very, very prominent Greek city back in the day. Paul's relationship with this church is different than his relationship with some of the other churches we've seen where he obviously had the primary role in founding that church here. It looks like there were already Christians in Ephesus when Paul first showed up, and this is where we get introduced to the characters of Priscilla and Aquila, a couple of important Christian leaders. They were a married couple. They factored prominently in the church in Rome as well. And so in Ephesus, Paul was more joining something that already had some momentum and bringing theological clarity to it as well. And also, Paul very quickly earns his stripes in Ephesus. He's there more than once, but on one of those journeys, he runs afoul of the people who celebrate the worship of Artemis. One of the seven ancient wonders of the world was this temple to Artemis or Diana, the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. And there was this magnificent temple there. There's pretty much nothing left of it now. In fact, Ephesus in general, it's weird what happened to it. It got all silt it in at the mouth of this river. And so it ceased to become a port over several centuries, and it just gave way to ruin, which is also what happened to this famous great temple of Artemis, where there's this legend about maybe some kind of meteorite or something falling from heaven. And maybe that somehow being carved into some kind of likeness of Artemis or maybe that was Artemis, they believed or the legend that they spun falling from heaven or something like that, whatever the case, people in the ancient world bought it. And there was a whole lot of religious tourist travel pilgrimage to Ephesus where people spent a ton of money. Well, then along comes Jesus through the teachings of Paul and Aquila and Priscilla and the leaders of that community who made little idols and stuff, trinkets and stuff that you could sell at gift shops associated with the shrine of Artemis. They got really threatened and upset. And all of this is recorded in the book of Acts and Paul almost gets murdered by a mob. Just like everywhere else, Paul, I mean, say what you want about him, dude is steadfast and he's not afraid. And no doubt that steadfastness became part of the DNA of the church there. And Paul, when he's traveling around and knows that he's probably staring down his final days and walking into something calamitous in Jerusalem, he almost got a prime away from the church and Ephesus. He loves these people and he clearly views the church and Ephesus as a microcosm of what has gone right in all of history and the unfolding of the redemptive plan. And more specifically in this new paradigm, this new age of this new covenant, this new deal with Jesus after the arrival of his spirit. And in light of all of that, despite the fact that this letter was being written from a Roman prison, Paul is just so excited. It is like he's overflowing throughout this whole letter and inviting, apparently, not just the church and Ephesus, but several other churches that this letter got handed around and cycled between. He's inviting all of these Christians to pause for just a moment and reflect on what God has done, something that's never been done before. That is to create a unified people, worshiping the one true God without regard for race or ethnicity or gender or even status socially in the ancient world. Everybody is together under this one roof and Paul views that as being the completion of a whole bunch of promises from the Old Testament. He views this as being an image of the divine kingdom. This is a picture, a snapshot of foretaste of heaven because this theoretically should not happen. And I'm with Paul on this point, maybe one of the top five, top 10 greatest miracles of the whole New Testament where it seems like the laws of time and space are getting broken in crazy, visible ways left and right. Maybe one of the biggest miracles of all there is that people who should have had nothing to do with each other, divisions that ran too deep and too historically, they were incentivized to hate each other and avoid each other. They overcame all of that because the message of the gospel permeated them so greatly that it trumped all of those differences. Paul is very excited about that and is it peace despite the fact that he finds himself in very difficult circumstances. Celebrating this new family, this new paradigm, he's celebrating how God ordained this redemption from the very beginning here in the first part of the book. He's talking about how all of this is for God's glory and that he is master over how all of this is unfolded. And he further celebrates that all of it is by grace. Just look, the history of everything. It's too ugly. There's too much hurt for all of it to get worked out by people just acting a little bit nicer all of a sudden. The only way this could happen was to be undergirded by the forgiveness of God by the grace of God. And he says that it is indeed by that grace that we've been saved, whether Jewish or Gentile. Salvation isn't just a change of mind or an inclination toward being nicer. He says that we were dead, that we were deceived, fooled by the spirit of darkness in the world and that there is no way to bring ourselves to life. But then God, through Christ, made us alive and that Christians being made alive isn't just for the purpose of marveling as Paul is doing it. How awesome this story is and how amazing it is that that happened to this person and that person and that other person who's now in Christ. But he indicates that Christians are made alive in Christ for a purpose to go and do stuff that is redemptive and kingdom-oriented and representative in the world of the values and character of God who is head of this new family of faith that he has made and invited us into by no merit or no works of our own that we cannot boast. But that all of it is a celebration of the work of God and a mobilizing celebration as it compels Christians outward toward redemptive action. It is wonderful and I cannot get enough of the whole book of Ephesians, but you get quickly wrapped up in this celebratory feel and tone along with Paul, especially when you encounter Ephesians after going through the whole Bible and seeing all the ups and downs and the yucks. And because of that, it's really easy to follow his flow of thought and to pivot with him into the implication section of the book. Maybe you can call that part two where he says, look, we're one. We shouldn't be. We're unified even though we're not the same and we're coming from all these different places and we're wired differently. And then he chases this celebration of unity with sort of an expanded look at the contrast that we got at the end of the book of Galatians between the acts of this sinful nature and the fruit of the spirit. And he talks about how that both makes right relationships within society, within marriage, within family possible. But further, he points to that image of the mutual self-sacrifice between the man and a woman in marriage and talks about how that is somehow exemplary of the relationship between Christ and his bride, the church. But then Paul wraps up the letter by saying, there is something working against this beautiful new paradigm, this family of faith. And it's hardwired into everything. It's ethereal, it's institutional. It's packed into the seams and the assumptions behind everything. And further, there is a spiritual, active, evil, personal resistance to this glorious new family of faith that God is building. And the only way to stand strong against that kind of evil that undergirds all of this resistance to God is by putting on, and Paul uses a beautiful metaphor here, the full armor of God. And he goes through each of these elements of what the Christian is to equip themselves with and points out how metaphorically this is all the stuff that God gives the Christian to live in this beautiful family of faith, to live in obedience to Christ, to be an agent and an heir of the kingdom, even while having to resist this personal, active, spiritual darkness and resistance to God that exists in the world. You get to the end of Ephesians and it feels like that real old TV show called the A-Team or the leader, Hannibal Smith would grab his cigar and be like, I love it when a plan comes together. And it's like that, but probably without the cigar, I don't know. I don't think they probably had the cigars back then. When you visualize the book of Ephesians, picture armor, when you think about the theme, reflect on marveling at what God has done and considering the implication for that in the lives of Christians. If you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure you at least get chapter two and make sure you also catch that armor of God stuff in chapter six versus 10 through 20. Internet high five, that's our level up on the book of Ephesians. Next time around, we got the book of Philippians. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon."
