This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and we are busting our butts to try to understand what's going on in Matthew chapter 24. Jesus gives us answer to the disciples question about when he, when the son of man is going to return. And in the home stretch of this answer, it looks like he is just pulling on a jillion little threads from the Old Testament. And so in just literally one verse, we've already been all over the Old Testament in Isaiah, Daniel and Ezekiel looking at the stuff that Jesus would seem to be referencing or calling to mind for his original audience about what it's going to be like when the son of man returns. So the verse we're looking at is just this immediately after the distress of those days. These are the words of Jesus. The sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. Stars will fall from the sky and the heavenly bodies will be shaken. Now we've already seen that Jesus is invoking here a judgment of God against Babylon, a group that profaned the temple and were punished profoundly. Babylon at the time of Jesus was used as a metaphor, a pen name, a pseudonym. We even call it a codename. I like that better, a codename for Rome and the current occupiers. Come under the leadership of Pompeii, 60, 70, 80 years before Jesus had profaned the temple. And so the prophecies against Babylon would have had a double meaning for the original audience there. And then we went over to Ezekiel and saw that in Ezekiel 32, there's very similar language used in a judgment against Egypt. And as we left off yesterday, you might feel like you couldn't possibly cram any more meaning or illusions into so few words in Matthew 24, Jesus, he's super good at language and ideas. And apparently he'd read the Bible once twice, maybe in three times all the way through while he was awake to, not like while he's fallen asleep late at night trying to get it in so he can say that he did it. And so he just knows this stuff like the back of his hand and he can wield it so quickly, like a double edged sword. And he does so by also including a reference to Joel in the midst of what he's saying there with the stuff about sons being darkened and moons going dark and things shaken and all of that business. Joel chapter two and verse 10 is also in view where it says, before them, the earth shakes, the sky trembles, the sun and moon are darkened and the stars no longer shine. The Lord thunders at the head of his army, his forces are beyond number and mighty are those who obey his command. The day of the Lord is great, it is dreadful, who can endure it. Are you seeing the pattern develop here in Isaiah 13, chapter 24, Ezekiel 32, Joel 2, all of these are little information nuggets. They're little references, they're little shout outs, but trailing behind them on a string are gigantic information packets and the gigantic information packets are all about this day of judgment. They're all about God's judgment. They're all about him resolving something that seems like it's just going to be a loose end flapping around in the breezes of history for all of eternity, maybe eventually to be forgotten and glossed over. But no, God is God of justice and judgment and he's also the God of grace and love. But here it's focusing on the judgment part. It's focusing on the the clause and fangs part of the tiger, not the pretty fur and the majestic movements and loveliness of the tiger. And I got to think the original audience was picking up what Jesus was putting down and Jesus cramps in so many references because clearly he wants them to pick up what he's putting down. And so in Joel, really throughout the whole book, but in Joel 2, where we're looking right now, this is an oracle about God using nature to remind people that he is the master of history and to call his own people back to him and correct them for what they had been getting wrong. Some people read Joel and say, Oh, no, I think maybe there's like a physical enemy in view and they speculate that it's this kingdom or that empire or whatever. But it's not as evident here as it is in these other books that we're looking at, but it follows the exact same pattern as everything else. There's a proclamation of judgment on the part of God, some specifics about how the judgment will be carried out. But then there's this shift in tone, this glimmer of hope toward deliverance. There's going to be correction, but then there's going to be a making right of all the things or restoration. That fits exactly with what everything about what Jesus is saying in Matthew chapter 24. There's going to be a correction and a difficult time. This is going to be tough. These are the consequences of the fallenness of the world, but the return of the son of man is the deliverance and it follows the same prophetic pattern that we see through the whole Old Testament. You might be thinking, Oh, wow, I can't believe he got all that in. That was really helpful and really good, but my brain is full. And I'm not sure I can handle any more Old Testament illusions that are crammed into what Jesus said here in just one verse in Matthew 24 29. I think I'm going to go and get some ice cream and just reflect on what we've covered here because this has already been so thorough and so good, but not so fast because there's more that he is referencing here, including later on in Joel chapter two, verse 31, where the prophet writes, well, it's starting verse 30, I will show wonders on the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned into darkness, the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord and everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, there will be deliverance as the Lord has said among the survivors whom the Lord calls. And that's where he started to get the pivot in the whole book of Joel, starting to inch toward the deliverance part of things. Wow, that's so much. And obviously it's impossible for anyone even got in the flesh himself to cram any more illusions or references into something as small as one verse like Matthew 24 29 or is it? Because if you just turn over a few pages in your Bible to the very next book, which is Amos and you look at Amos chapter five, you see in verse 20 that nope, he's conjuring even more imagery here because in that verse, it says, will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not light pitch dark without a ray of brightness. I hate I despise your religious feasts. I cannot stand your assemblies, even though you bring me burn offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them though you bring choice fellowship offerings. I have no regard for them. So God is in intense mode with his people here. Then if you go into a little homework on the context of Amos, what you discover is that the northern kingdom and the southern kingdom looked like they were at the high points of their power, but they're actually a moral dumpster fire within. They go through these perfunctory motions of doing things that still look like what they're supposed to do with God in the same fashion as what Jesus was calling out in the sermon on the Mount with fake prayer and fake giving and fake fasting and all of that nonsense. Israel and Judah at this time still did religious looking things, but their hearts were very, very far from God and stuff was an ugly mess once you got past the external gilding. I mean, it looks like they were going to, you know, we're going to lip forever, yo. Not the case. There's a cancer in there and stuff was breaking down from the inside. And so Amos is saying, like, this is the kind of judgment that's coming. This is how God is unhappy with what you're doing and who you are as a people and as a culture right now. You need to turn from that and ask for God's forgiveness. And that's kind of the message of the thing. This one stays pretty heavily in judgment mode all the way to the very, very end when there is language again about restoration and forgiveness and the judgment happens. And then we're going to get on to the next thing. So it very much follows that same structure, but not before we get another thing to which Jesus is alluding in one simple verse in Matthew chapter 24. And that happens in Amos eight verse nine in that day declares the sovereign Lord, I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth and broad daylight. I will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all you're singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I don't see why that would be bad or a point of judgment. Some people look really good with shaved heads. There are a lot of women who actually say that shaved head is super, super attractive and men. I read a thing one time that's definitely true. I even know why that's in there. I will make that time like morning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day. But then once again, just one page over, we're back to language about deliverance after this time of judgment and suffering. And I don't think it's an accident that every single thing that Jesus is referencing discreetly in Matthew 24 29 points to that same structure. God judges and corrects. There is a time of difficulty that is a direct result of human failure and evil and selfishness sin. But then God does some kind of correction. People's hearts are softened and it's evident that he is king once again. And everybody's like, Oh, yeah, that's that's right. That's the true thing. And then there is a deliverance that comes after it. And at this point, you got to be thinking really that that's got to be all of it. He can't possibly be cramming more meaning into Matthew 24 29. Right? Wrong. Homie. He's cramming in even more. So much is going to take another episode. So we're hitting pause here and then we're going to pick it up and continue to look at all of the other stuff that Jesus is still referencing very clearly in Matthew 24 29. And then we're going to think about like, what does it mean? Why is he referencing all of this stuff after that? All right. Let's do this again.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 9.200000000000001, "text": " Hey, my friends, it's Matt.", "tokens": [14690, 11, 616, 2460, 11, 340, 338, 4705, 13],
