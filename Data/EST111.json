And right now, we're going through Esther. You ever sit around and think what Xerxes daily life might have been like is king over Persia, basically king over the entire world in the fifth century BC. Because we're going through the book of Esther. There've been a few moments where that kind of occurs to me. It's a little bit difficult to empathize because he's the king of absolutely everything. And I'm the king of absolutely nothing. But even in my teeny, tiny little world where I sit down here literally in my basement, which is filthy, by the way, I have got a mountain of Bibles and books and empty cough drop wrappers all around me. This is shameful. Something has to be done. But even in my tiny little world, there is still this constant rush of stuff. And in my brain, I liken it to me standing in a shallow part of a really fast moving river with a big waterfall at my back with steam and mist rolling around back there. It's all loud. And I got a couple of friends, fortunately, standing there as well. And we're all kind of playing defense here in terms of life and work and stuff just keeps coming downstream. And it's not like garbage. It's valuable stuff. It's all of its valuable. But the stream is always moving as time passes. Stuff is accelerating toward me. You just can't grab it all. You try to. You try to build systems. And again, friends help, but there's only so much you can do. And every now and then you look at each other and you're like, did something really important? Just go by. I feel like something really important just went by. Okay. And then somebody goes down to the bottom of the waterfall and it's like, ah, nuts. We missed that. We didn't reply to that. Dang it. We were supposed to do this thing. And okay, well, we can still get this straightened out. And some of you are probably listening to this and you're like, yeah, I sent you a really important email like a year ago. And you didn't reply to me. And I'm very, very earnestly sorry about that, by the way. But I also think that everybody can relate to this, right? It feels like life just comes at you real, real fast. And you do your best to catch everything. You use your smartphone and systems that you build to try to catch everything, but you can't. Well, now imagine that you're Xerxes. Well, that's insane. He's got to handle everything, all the stuff of the entire world. And if you're Xerxes, that's not just reactive. It's also proactive because basically anything you can imagine is going to happen. So no matter the fact that you and I are not kings and queens, if you are, dang, I'm honored. Thank you for being here. It's really cool. Your majesty. I appreciate you listening to this program. And obviously all of the things I just said about not being a king or a queen, it doesn't apply to you. The rest of us, if we can barely keep up how much more so is Xerxes going to need a bajillion complex systems to keep up with all of this? And it looks like one of those systems that he used to keep track of his obligations, to keep track of mental notes, things you need to do, achieve or records that he never really had anything to do with, but would need to have access to that knowledge, is he apparently had a group of royal chroniclers. And these royal chroniclers would have done more than just keep track of basic administrative things. I think there was a lower administrative tier of clerks, people who kept track of grain shipments and this kind of administrative stuff. In fact, we know that this is the case. This is one of the few places where we've got really rich primary source material on the Persian Empire. Over in Persepolis, you'll recall that's another one of the capitals of Persia at this time. They're east from Sousa in Persepolis when Alexander the Great showed up in, what would that be, around 330 BC, he burned most of Persepolis. And in doing so, one of the main walls collapsed and it covered one of these archives where a whole bunch of little clay tablets with etched writing and administrative records for this low level administrative stuff. All of that got smashed in upon by these walls, but also the fire burned really hot right there and it's like it rebaked the clay. And so in the 1930s, a team from the University of Chicago was digging around in the ruins of Persepolis and they found this trove, this horde of tens and tens of thousands of these really very boring administrative records. And they still haven't gone through all of them. It's going to be like a two century project to carefully go through all of it. The AI will be the thing that finally vastly accelerates the deciphering of all of these tablets. Some of them are in Chicago, some of them are back in Iran at this point. But it's just all kinds of information about who shipped grain ware. Two bars of figs supplied by Soutana was taken to Persepolis for the royal stores. Bacabada and Nabada received it 21st year. That's actually one of the receipts from this administrative trove. And that trove is all from the latter half of Darius' reign. So Xerxes, the king we're looking at here in the Book of Esther and the king we're discussing today, he would have been very familiar with boring Persian administrative record keeping, which appears to have been very, very thorough. So that's fascinating. And we can learn a lot about the rhythms of the Persian economy and how Persian kings distributed wealth and withheld wealth from their subjects. And that's great in all. But I think what you and I are talking about here is bigger than that. We're talking about all of those mental notes, all of the obligations, all of the petitions and things that were directed straight at the king, straight at Xerxes that he had to keep in his head. And maybe you can relate to this as well, perhaps especially if you have kids or if you're a boss where you work, people come to you, kids come to you, people who need you come to you and their decision kind of has to run through you. And they'll bring you a question and you're like, okay, that's a fair question. First of all, directing it at me is the right thing to do. And I know I need to make a decision on this, but there are a lot of other factors. And I'm going to have to think on that for a little bit. I cannot give you an answer right now. This might take a couple of days, maybe from time to time, you have to do that because you don't know what the right answer is and you don't just want to flippantly throw something out. Well, again, that's the kind of thing that can make stuff go over the waterfall, right? Because you couldn't answer the question, the reasonable question in the moment, you needed to gather more data, but then other things happened, then you never came back around to that question. Well, that is what somebody like Xerxes would need these chroniclers to help him with. But it doesn't look like many of these chroniclers were giving carte blanche to just come and chirp things at him all the time. In fact, Herodotus points it out as being, that's the ancient Greek historian who tells us a lot about the courts of Xerxes and Darius. Herodotus makes it sound like it was a very unique thing when the king of Persia was like, hey, would you remind me every day to punish the Athenians? I have a lot going on right now. If you could just bug me at dinner like three times at every meal to just remind me, I need to go kill Athens. It seems like a silly example, but again, if you put yourself in the shoes of a king like Darius or his son Xerxes, you can kind of start to imagine why you might need that for the really important stuff. I've got a few pinned conversations in my text thread where if I know something is hugely important. Just answer that. I pin it to the top of my text thread so that I can only earn unpinning that particular text by doing the task that is assigned there. Things like that, tricks like that exist now, tricks like that existed back then. And I am sure that at times in your life, you have been ready to relax or kind of be done with the day and you're laying there with your head on your pillow and you're thinking to yourself, it's not right. The day's not done. There's something that needed to happen here. And I know I haven't done it, but I just cannot summon it from my mind. What do you do when that happens? You go thumb through your phone and you go scroll through your email a little bit. Maybe you try to just power through it and go to sleep. But if you're like me, I can't shut it off. If I have that nagging feeling that I'm forgetting something. Well, in Esther chapter six, I think we're seeing a guy Xerxes, king of Persia, who has been prompted in a really interesting way. He's been riddled a little bit by his wife, queen Esther. And he goes to a meal, a banquet with her and he's like, okay, this is awesome. This is really fun. Well, what is it that you want? Why are you having a banquet for me? Tell me what you need. And she's like, no, tomorrow, let's do another banquet. And then I'll tell you then. And it seems like the king is just tickled. Like he's really enjoying this. But it also seems like it's sticking in his brain a little bit, which I think is super fun because this detail to me gives the impression that Xerxes kind of loves his wife, that he's still enchanted by her after all these years and that she can still pull his chain a little bit like this and really get him thinking. So what we get at the end of Esther chapter five is the banquet wraps up the bad guy of the banquet, Heyman goes home and his evening of thinking about things and reflecting on it brings him to the conclusion that he should make a 75 foot high pole and ram it into his enemy Mordecai and just stick it up real high so everybody can see that. But then we turn the page to Xerxes, who's apparently up well into the night, almost into daybreak and he's sitting here thinking about something totally different. My guess is that thought process started with what is Esther trying to tell me? Did I forget something? I make a promise. Is there something I was supposed to do? And then we see him do the equivalent of pulling out his smartphone and scrolling messages to try to figure out what it is. That is that he calls in a royal chronicler and he's like, just read to me some things that are on the list, things that have come up lately. This is how that actually goes in Esther chapter six. That night the king couldn't sleep. So he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign to be brought in and read to him. We have talked so much over the course of our journey through the book of Esther about the unnamed God who is providentially working behind all of these seemingly little innocuous circumstances. And what is shaping up here is that one of these nagging thoughts, am I getting all of my work done chasing ideas about what needs to be accomplished tomorrow, that kind of night, which we've all had. It looks like this unnamed God is providentially scheduled one of these for exactly this night for King Xerxes. And as he's unable to sleep and pacing around and scrolling his old messages to try to figure out either what he's missed or to feel better about things he wished he could have done better to be propped up by notes about positive achievements, whatever it is that he's exactly doing here this night. We're going to see in the next verse that we look at tomorrow that something really timely and really important is going to be found as he's up late scrolling these old archives. Not that you know what my friends. It's okay if you don't remember every single thing. We live in a weird time and I don't think it's humanly possible to keep up with what we've built for ourselves. The last 15 years have been the age of the waterfall app. Those are apps that are not meant to be a resource like Wikipedia where you just go and look up the knowledge you want and then get on with it. No, the last 15 years have been centered around reshaping our brains. And I dare say our souls around unending waterfall flow stream apps just keep it in refresh and keep getting more stuff. It teaches us to think that none of it hangs together or has any meaning. It makes us feel insufficient. It makes us feel like we should be able to achieve and mentally keep track of 50 times more than we're actually able to meaningfully be attentive to. And I would like to just extend to you, Grace, and saying that these are impossible standards. And I know you're kicking butt and you're doing your best. I'm trying not to be discouraged by these things. And also, maybe I'll just extend myself a little bit of grace on that as well. Even the great King Xerxes, the King of Kings, the King of land and water he couldn't keep up with all of this stuff either. It's just, it's a lot. It's okay. I'm Matt.
