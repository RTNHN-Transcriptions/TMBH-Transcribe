There's this beloved character in season one and he gets in trouble part way through the season and his fate is in the hands of an erratic all powerful king. But there is this sweet girl from an outsider group who marries the king and is now in a position of influence and when the good guy, main character who you care about is in trouble and his fate is in the hands of the king, this queen goes to him and she advocates and is like, hey, you're making this rash decision to execute this guy. You should reconsider, please reconsider and it looks like the king is going to reconsider and then at the last moment when he makes his public proclamation, he's like, I have re reconsidered and then chaos ensues and the drama is figuring out whether or not the beloved main character is going to get killed or not. It's just a great sequence dramatically and it's exemplary of the really great writing that made the show I'm vaguely referencing so popular for so very long. But it's also interesting for our discussion today because there are two points of overlap. With the story that we're looking at here is we're on the scene between Esther two and Esther chapter three. Point of overlap number one is obviously the erratic dangerous king who sort of makes willy-nilly decisions and the outsider queen who is there to influence him. I mean, that sounds a lot like Esther so you got that. And then also there's a situation where you get the wild reversal in the season finale of the season I'm talking about where it looks like one outcome is very, very likely, but then you're just shocked as an audience member when the whole thing pivots on its heel and it goes in a completely different direction. And that's what we get here where it looks like Mordecai is set up for all kinds of accolades and things we're about to get even better for Mordecai and Esther and by proxy the Jews in general and they're standing in this really relatively new Persian empire. And it looks like things are about to get better because Mordecai was sitting in the right place at the right time at the gate and heard a couple of would-be assassins big than a and Tarrish that went better than yesterday talking about now they were going to kill the king. And now the great king of king's life he seems so powerful in everything but his life is in the hands of Mordecai little Mordecai the Jew. He could just say nothing he wouldn't even have to do anything would he even be morally culpable if he didn't do anything and he could just let the king die or he could be proactive and to save the king's life and he does that. And at the end of the chapter we conclude by learning that all this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king. So it looks like Mordecai is set to be on the good end of things with the king to receive honor and for stuff in our story to get even better but then we get a shocking pivot that we talked a little bit about yesterday here at the beginning of chapter three that goes like this. After these events King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hamadath the agogite elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all other nobles. So wait a dang minute who is this guy even we haven't even talked about him right as his name even come up in our conversations that certainly hasn't come up in the book of Esther. Maybe I've mentioned this Haman guy was coming along maybe I've just referenced there's a bad guy coming but he just becomes out of left field. The clear blue sky who even is this guy and for us as modern readers who maybe haven't looked closely at this just yet the injustice is grievous just because Mordecai was owed to something and instead it goes to somebody else. But when we look closer to the text here and even read ahead further we discover that this injustice runs far deeper. Remember it's not even that this king is trying to be abusive or destructive he just does things he's influenceable and being around him is both to be in the presence of tremendous influence and power but to be around him also is to be in danger just by the sheer nature of things. This king has a raunchy breakfast burrito and he could just wipe out an entire people group without thinking about it before lunchtime he has that much power and at times seems to be presented as being that inattentive and influenceable. So when we did closer into the text we discovered that this dishonor this insult to Mordecai this ingratitude that's demonstrated is even worse because Haman is an agagite. Well that begs the question what is an agagite and I'm so very very glad you asked. An agagite is somebody descended from a guy named Agag and Agag aga gag bomber name was the king of the Amalekite people at the time of the reign of King Saul so that would be a little bit before 1000 BC so we're looking at roughly 600 years before the events we're reading about in the book of Esther that we're talking about here with this agagite king of the Amalekites. So what would they be compared to now? So that would be like going back in time to roughly when Christopher Columbus was sailing the ocean blue for you and me. The point is it's a really really long time ago when we go from the time of Esther to talking about the time of Saul and agag. Again agag is the king of a people group called the Amalekites who were constant pain in the butt for the Israelites going back another 400 ish years before the time of Saul and agag. So in total the tension between the Amalekite people and the Jewish people at the time of the events described in the book of Esther during the reign of King Xerxes it goes back almost a thousand years. So you're talking about grievances as old as William the conquerors invasion of Great Britain. You're talking about grievances. Well this next one I'm about to throw out is actually maybe a bad example grievances as old as the first crusade that actually does trickle down to now the point I was trying to make was that it's a long time ago and we don't remember a lot of the grievances from that long ago but maybe the point I'm accidentally making is that there are some grievances that last a thousand years even though most stuff is forgotten it's got to be a really significant grievance to travel that far through time. Yeah I think that's a better point I just backed into it we'll take it. We first run into the Amalekites in Exodus something to something I don't remember what it is right in the middle and market but I know where it is because I kind of memorized the layout of this particular Bible. So if I just flip around here I'm going to find it and there it is yep because I just remembered where it was on the page you know how that works you do that sometimes. Exodus 17 is where we run into the Amalekites and this is a really famous part of Exodus. The Amalekites are sneaky they factor into a bunch of places in the Bible the totally remember but you forgot that the Amalekites were there. So in Exodus 17 you get the first situation where Moses is like okay I get it everybody's thirsty we've done our Exodus we're wandering around the desert everybody's mad fine we'll get some water out of the rock and then right after that the Amalekites who are just being jerks come and attack the Israelites after they've left Egypt and they're wandering around in the desert all vulnerable and Amalek comes down and I'm like well let's just kill all of these people and the biggest insult to injury here is that they're related the Amalekites are a cousin people of the Jewish people of the Israelites of the Hebrews because they are descended from Esau and then of course the Jewish people the Israelites are descended from Jacob and those guys were brothers and admittedly Jacob and Esau their whole deal it was a rough brotherhood but I don't know they patched it up after some really difficult grievances in the early going but apparently the bad blood lingers and the Amalekites do not feel any familial loyalty or courtesy is owed to their Hebrew cousins and so they attack them in the middle of the desert in Exodus 17 and maybe you're thinking oh there's so many battles in the by-wides like then some people fought some people and they slaughtered everybody and there's a fight and whatever I'm not going to remember it but that's false you're probably going to remember this one because it's one of the most famous memorable battles in the Bible because it's a miraculous battle check it out Exodus 17 8 the Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Refidim I think I said that right ish Moses said to Joshua choose some of our men and go out and fight the Amalekites tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands you remember in this one now so Joshua fought the Amalekites he's like the young up and coming leader who eventually takes over for Moses so Joshua fights them as Moses had ordered and Moses Aaron that's Moses brother and priest and who are went to the top of the hill as long as Moses held up his hands the Israelites were winning but whenever he lowered his hands the Amalekites were winning when Moses hands grew tired they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it Aaron and who held his hands up one on one side and one on the other so that his hands remained steady till sunset so Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword then the Lord said to Moses write this on a scroll is something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven Moses built an altar and called it the Lord is my banner or my rallying point he said for hands were lifted up to the throne of the Lord the Lord will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation so again this Haman guy who just got the honor in Esther chapter three that seems like it should have gone to Mordecai and who is now in a position of authority over Mordecai and all of the Jews it looks like we're being told that he's a descendant of these Amalekites but to this passage in Exodus 17 this is really the beginning of the distinctively bad blood between these two groups and I think this incident also introduces a thematic through line for all of the relationship between the Jews and the Amalekites and also the relationship between Haman and the Jews and what he wants to do to them is we move along in Esther it introduces this theme of plunder I mean why did the Amalekites attack the Hebrews in the desert really is it just because they were really mean and they wanted revenge for centuries old slights that maybe they kind of remembered I mean it could be but more so they probably would have attacked anybody just roaming around in the desert because it's free money remember God softened the hearts of the Egyptians during the Exodus in some weird way that I still can't wrap my brain around and the Egyptians were like you know what here take a bunch of our gold and our silver and our food and our fancy outfits just take all of this wealth with you maybe it's a big social movement where they felt guilt for what they had done to this group of people maybe it was something that supernaturally went against the intuition of the Egyptian people but it just happened and now they're gone it's just too late to go get your money back I don't know but whatever happened there the text in Exodus describes that incident as being one by which the Hebrew people plundered their former masters well they're just walking around with all of that out in the desert they got it probably in boxes or baggies or something and the Amalekites they historically ranged from the eastern edge of Egypt all the way up to the eastern edge of Israel and so I mean they knew they would have had scouts I think they just wanted to plunder these people I think they viewed him as easy pickens and maybe somebody raised the objections like hey they're kind of family I don't know I don't know if that would be right I mean we wouldn't like it if our family did that to us they're kind of having a pretty tough time of it because they're homeless and everything right now and they don't really have a country I mean maybe we could just follow them around until they die and then take their stuff but then probably some other Amalekites were like nah I don't know family's family it's the long ways back look at all that gold and shiny stuff and fancy outfits just kill them and take it all this is our chance to solidify ourselves as a great nation by taking all of the things that they're carrying around with them so whatever the motivation and I do think it was plunder the Amalekites violate one of the age old values of humanity across cultures I mean what's one of them is you don't injure somebody you invite into your house if you extend hospitality to someone you've extended hospitality to someone they are under your protection that's a value that goes cross-culture in the ancient world and another one is you don't kill family you don't do stuff like this the world's a tough place we got enough problems we can't have problems like this coming from within however grievous you view this violation of the Amalekites against their kin the Hebrews it's probably worse than what you're picturing in terms of ancient Near Eastern values I think this was a grievous offense the kind of thing that you do not come back from relationally effectively half of the family said to the other half of the family we want to genocide you we want you dead and gone and given the opportunity to do so push comes to show we've now revealed our true colors and we will genocide you we will kill you given the opportunity and we will pick over your bones and take your things and that's just not a good look so two things real quick on the way out the door one we're just going to pause right there I'll pick up where we left off
