"transcription_data": {"text": " a while back in the line watch the series on i think it was hb o i'm gonna say hb o and it was called pillars of the earth it's based on a ken fallot novel that is sweeping historical epic that he wrote somewhere in the nineteen eighties and i think it was a one-season deal on hb o or wherever it was it is really really good i don't think i recommend it for the purposes of not sending you off to watch something that's horribly offensive i can't remember i don't know it's at my heart of fenn whatever i really appreciated the show it's about the building of this great fictional cathedral in england in the middle ages and i think i've heard that ken fallot was drawing on the story of the building of solesbury cathedral and wells cathedral and and tell us how this show i just never really thought much about all of the energy and drama and politics and time and death and bloodshed and money and resistance that you would run into in trying to build a truly multi-generational thing like one of these great medieval cathedrals but the the writing and the cast of characters brought it to life and and maybe think about that for the first time the cast by the way my goodness uh... the guy from deadwood als where engine come on matt you got in mccain uh... isn't john wick as well as a guy who runs the hotel in john wick he was in it was great uh... young hailey atwell the peggy carter from the captain america stuff she was in it and uh... any red mane before he got big i think it was the first role i ever saw him in as well and then a bunch of those actors you don't know their names but they're in all the cool stuff that involves british accents so again i want to recommend it but i think i need to not recommend it the point is though the point did back to it it was the first time i had ever thought about just how hard it would be to muster the resources and overcome the resistance that would naturally spring up to such a great big grand idea who is the architect from uh... the chicago world's fair the columbian exposition uh... uh... route and uh... can't remember his partners at burnham burnham and route they were the two and one of those two guys may be a burnham said something like and don't dream small dreams they have no power to stir men's souls and so when you dream a great big project like this not only is going to stir men's souls in positive ways to get on board and be a part of a thing it's also going to stir the souls of people toward jealousy and envy and resistance and likewise as you and i've been looking at the later old testament here in the story uh... that we get in the book of asir about the rebuilding of the temple we see that again a project that big ain't gonna be easy for the land for the money for the resistance for the stirring of people's souls both toward enthusiasm and toward anger about your project and we really get a very pillars of the earthy story here in asra or maybe pillars of the earth is a very asra ish story asra's given us the fast version here and that can cause us to forget how big a chunk of time we're talking about this edict that sirens the second issue dates all the way back to five thirty eight by the time we get to the second year the reign of king darius we've already had a decade and a half of resistance in red tape this has been a massively difficult project for all sorts of logistical and interpersonal conflict reasons profits have had to have been mustard to get this thing moving again so then if you take a minute to think of this project in light of all that resistance and all the blood sweat and tears and everything that went into it and the providential work of god to move kings and to move about seemingly unrelated gigantic historical events happening in purgian politics to make this go it just makes it all that much more satisfying when you get to the end of chapter six and the thing gets rebuilt the temple is up and it's being rededicated and i want to read a little bit from asra six here so you and i can appreciate and bask in this triumphant moment the dedication of the temple a little bit as well pick it up in asra six thirteen then because of the decree king darius at sent tat and i governor of trans ephrades and south arbo's and i i still am not getting that name right and their associates carried it out with diligence so the elders and the jus continue to build and prosper under the preaching of hagi the prophet and zechariah a descendant of edo they finished building the temple according to the command of the god of israel and the decree of syrus darius and artis irksis kings of purgia again this is asra rounding out the fast forwarding that he did to show that the support for the temple and the resistance to the temple and the rebuilding of the things around it and the rebuilding of the culture around it continued long past the reign of darius into the mid four hundreds i know that's a little bit chronologically confusing as a writing style but this isn't him just screwing it up and forgetting who was alive when and why he keeps jumping forward with all of this becomes more evident as you read the rest of asra and nehemiah and we're just going to roll with it and okay so we got syrus darius and artis irksis kings of purgia the temple was completed on the third day of the month adar in the sixth year of the reign of king darius so that's going to be march i used to know this i don't know the date i don't have it written down in front of me mid march somewhere five sixteen bc you'll see some people to put this at five fifteen a while back maybe thirty forty years ago there's a little bit of debate about where exactly to put darius's ascendance to the throne and how that would have been dated whether it was after the killing of bardia or whether it was after he went and fought and put those nine wars and put down the rest of the rebellions but it looks like we're pretty sure this is five sixteen march mid march somewhere of five sixteen bc it's kind of cool that we're getting to that level of detail when we get into the later parts of the old testament i just think that's fun then the people of israe ill the priest the leviets and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of the house of god with joy for the dedication of this house of god they offered a hundred bowls two hundred rams four hundred male lambs and is a sin offering for all israel twelve male goats one for each of the tribes of israel and they installed the priests and their divisions and the leviets and their groups for the service of god at your russelum according to what is written in the book of moses and i think it's okay to celebrate with them if you've been on this journey through the old testament heck even if you just jump in with me now here on the this series on the book of ester which i understand has a whole lot of other parts of the bible in it on the run up to it but if you didn't been here with me through this it's okay to just breathe for a minute here and appreciate the greatness of this accomplishment the unlikelihood of this accomplishment building is gotten to be so dime a dozen with modern technology that we almost take it for granted that everybody should have something built for them like oh you should call a contractor or something you're getting some money or heck you don't even give them money just go to the bank be like i need money and in many economic climates the banks like that sure there's some money and then buildings they just happen they spring up out of nowhere it's not how things were back then especially a building like this that means something this isn't an arby's we're talking about where it's effectively politically neutral maybe vegans don't find it politically neutral no this means something this is the reestablishment of a people group who were on the brink of being gone this building and the investment that went into it and the battle to get it done oftentimes literally the battle to get it done comes with great promise that the people who built it will continue to be a people and the worship of their god the one true god the god of apricam is going to persist the existence of this building though it seems like a bit of a foreign concept given how we think about building today back then the existence of this building was a physical monument to the continuation of the promise of god to see through his redemptive plan and you'll notice that what we don't see here in Ezra chapter six is a mix of crying and celebration like what we saw a few chapters back remember back in Ezra three we're talking about 20 years earlier than the dedication stuff we're looking at in chapter six but all the people give this great shout because of the foundation it says but many of the older priests and Levites and family heads who had seen the former temple wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid while many others shouted for joy no one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping because the people made so much noise and the sound was heard far away well some things have changed in these 20 years and that begs the question well what has changed in the psyche of these people is it that now it's not just a foundation it's a building and hey it might not be quite like the old one but great let's roll with it and this is wonderful something like we finally we got this done we achieved we pillars of the earth to this thing or is what's changed just that in 20 years those oldest people who would still remember what the old temple of Solomon looked like they've all died off and so there's no one left to compete with the celebration with crying because that had faded out of living memory i don't know the temple is an amazing accomplishment against all odds this shouldn't have happened the jewish people at this point they're half slaves basically their exiles they're homeless they have no business being able to pull something like this off they have no power at least not temporal tangible physical worldly power and yet there that building is in march of 516 bc that thing tells the story pretty cool that said the story is not done because just because the building is finished does not mean that everything else that goes with it is back on its feet and established for the long haul and as we see the end of darius's reign roll into the beginning of xerxes reign and then all the way into his son art as xerxes reign we see that there's still a lot of business to be done and the rest of the book of esra slash niamaya or esra and niamaya walks us through that and we'll hit the highlights of how esra and niamaya round out that part of the story but for those of you who've been around the old testament a little bit for those of you who remember what the dedication of the temple was like the first time around solomon's temple there is one big question that's still hanging out here and that is will the tangible visible spirit of god show up and occupy this temple the same way the spirit of god did during the dedication of the temple of solomon some of you already know and remember the answer to that others of you might not and tomorrow we're going to talk about it final thought as you may remember a couple days ago i had my good friend jeff foot take on the task of squishing together something that is homage to the top gun anthem with something that is homage to a socan farewell a socan farewell a shokan farewell i still don't know how to pronounce it i have tried a bunch of different things if somebody knows would you let me know on the subreddit or what it i don't know how to say it i'm just i'm trying i'm faking it but the point is jeff musch those things together and it sounded really awesome and i've had him do a slight re-edit on that that would be great for ringtone anyone who is a patron at patreon.com slash the tmbh podcast at any level that's going to be available to you over there for free to just have fun with if you want to thank you jeffrey that's it i'm at this is a ten minute bible hour podcast let's do this again soon you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.82, "text": " a while back in the line watch the series on i think
