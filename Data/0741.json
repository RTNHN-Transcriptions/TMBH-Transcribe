I'm around maybe in Colorado or something. And my family, the other four, they were in Sioux Falls. So, okay, a dual geography. I live in South Dakota on the far west side of South Dakota by Mount Rushmore and the mountains and everything is rapid city. That's where we live. And then on the far east side of the state is the other big city in South Dakota and that is Sioux Falls. I'm in a big city, I mean like 150 to 200,000 in the whole metro area. These aren't huge towns, but it's kind of an odd layout, sort of a dumbbell shape for the population distribution of the state. So that gives you a sense of how spread out we are. So it's a kind of thing where we would of course want to catch up with each other. And I fired up phone call to the family when I got a break. I was like, hey, how's the day going? Everything's over there. And I could tell that my daughter was really excited and she's like, well, check your phone. You can send me a picture and I look at the picture and it's my daughter's hanging out with the governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem. Now, while I'm offering no political judgment one way or the other in this conversation about Kristi Noem as a governor, I was still really pleased to hear the account of how she interacted with my daughters when they were brave enough to walk up to her in a Costco and be like, I think you're our governor. We just wanted to say hi. She was great. She treated my kids well. So that's cool. If I had called them and been like, well, how was your day? And they were like, oh, you know, we went to Costco and we did some other things and shopped a little bit and we got lunch and now we're going home. And they just omitted the part where they ran into the governor and then boldly approached her in public and asked if they could say hello and take a picture. Like if they left that out, it would be such a glaring omission that it would almost seem dishonest. Why would you withhold that? It's such a big deal, but I could imagine social reasons or a framing where in their recounting of the day, that wasn't something that they wanted to tell me that time around. And we can imagine scenarios where things would seem like a really big deal to us, the listener, are not the point of emphasis of the person telling the story. Likewise, when we look at the Bible, particularly the four gospels and we line them up next to each other and we compare, we discover that there are details in some of the other gospels when we're reading one. In this case, we're working on the Book of Matthew. We discover that sometimes there are stories or little details or tidbits that are really good and it seemed like a very big deal. And then it can be kind of strange and confusing as to why that is being left out of the one that we're reading. Hopefully there's some good reason. And you hope that something that's that big deal wasn't just an accidental omission. Well, we have one of those situations here in Matthew 27 with the crucifixion involving this criminal on the cross situation. All right, Matthew 2738, two robbers were crucified with him, him being Jesus, of course, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their head and saying, you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself. Come down from the cross if you're the son of God in the same way. The chief priests and the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. I mean, you'd think they'd be above it because just their jobs and their outfits and stuff, but now they're jumping in to back to the quote from the text, verse 42 says, he saved others, they said, but he can't save himself. He's the king of Israel. Let him come down now from the cross and we'll believe in him. He trusts God. Let God rescue him. If he wants him for he said, I'm the son of God in the same way, the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. And from there, it just goes on through the rest of the crucifixion. Wait a minute, something's missing, right? I mean, you all have heard this story and admittedly of all of the parts of the story of Jesus life and the gospels and everything, the part that runs together the most is the crucifixion, resurrection stuff. But there's something missing. The criminals on the cross, right? They have a conversation with Jesus and one of them is making fun of Jesus too. But then the other one has a change of heart and he comes around and he sizes up the situation and maybe after participating a little bit in the mockery, he's like, wait a dang minute. No, you know, we're getting this wrong. You know, remember me in paradise and Jesus is like, yes, I tell you, I will see you today in paradise. But that just isn't happening here in Matthew. Why would Matthew leave out a detail like that? Luke over in would have to be chapter 23, I suppose. Yep, 23. Why would Matthew leave out this detail that Luke includes? I mean, it's an amazing, beautiful anecdote and it's one of the smoking gun moments where Jesus specifically says, I tell you the truth today, you will be with me in paradise. That seems like it's a really big deal in terms of the equation of how a person goes from not a citizen of the kingdom, not a citizen of heaven to being a citizen of heaven. But Matthew totally neglects it. Well, I think the answer to that comes in what the agenda of the storytelling is. Let's go back to the situation with my kids, seeing Governor Christie Noem. Let's say that the thing they really wanted to relay about the day was whether or not they purchased the things that they traveled to, let's say, purchase and they were very excited, let's say, to run down the list of items they were able to obtain and to regret to inform me about the couple of items they were not able to obtain. And this shopping list was the key focus of the entire event. They're not particularly political young people. Maybe in such a scenario, the agenda of the phone call and the report they're giving, if it were to give me the details of these acquisitions or lack thereof, maybe the, yeah, we ran into some like government person who does government or sign on something like that. Maybe it just wouldn't matter that much to them for what they were trying to accomplish. Now in this scenario, they did know that running into the governor's kind of a big deal and getting to chat with the governor is kind of a big deal. So they did let me know. Well, correspondingly, back to the Bible question, we got to think then what's Luke going for and what's Matthew going for Luke? You'll recall is going for vindication. He's trying to say, look, everybody from all these different walks of life could see you Jesus actually was and they got him for kind of allowed this criminal on the cross next to him. That guy even got it. No, the Romans and the Jewish leadership, they really got this thing wrong. Christ is innocent. Christ is vindicated even though the law might make it look like he was somehow a bad guy. In this case, the law failed and got things wrong. Matthew on the other hand seems very interested in demonstrating that Jesus is the completion of the stuff in the Old Testament. He's the fulfillment of the law and the prophets and Matthew also seems very interested in this crucifixion account of emphasizing Jesus abandonment. He's left for dead by the people who love him the most. He's even abandoned in a sense by the father. The father doesn't respond to this mockery that's happening at the cross from the criminals from the religious leaders from the crowd. The father turns away and allows these things to happen to his son on the cross. So with all of that in mind, you can kind of see why Matthew would leave it out even though it is an awesome story. The case Matthew was trying to make is not advanced by saying that there was an insurrectionist and he thought Jesus was the Messiah. He got it. That isn't a vouch that would move the needle for his audience. So at the most basic level, my speculation would be that Matthew leaves this detail out because it doesn't advance that macro purpose or the more narrow purpose of demonstrating the abandonment Jesus is going through in Matthew 27 at the crucifixion. But then you might wonder, well, then why include the criminals on the cross at all? Why not just leave those details out because it's bloat. It's taken up extra space like what some criminals said a couple of mean things. Well, everybody's saying mean things. Why does it even matter? Well, it matters because Matthew has been pointing us to a few key passages back in Isaiah and Zechariah that point to what it's going to be like when the Messiah walks through all of these difficult things and Isaiah 53 is one of those places that we keep getting bounced back to. And here in Matthew 27, Matthew does not spell it out and be like, and those criminals being on the cross and Jesus being right there in between them, that is in fulfillment of Isaiah 53 because of this. Now, it seems like once we get into the crucifixion stuff itself, Matthew is content to just let people make the connections. He's already pointed us toward all of these passages or many of the passages that are being paid off with the details of the crucifixion. And instead he's just letting hang out there and theoretically you the reader are supposed to be able to go and figure it out. But there is a reason that the criminals had to be included because that is a payoff of Old Testament prophecy in Isaiah 53. You'll remember this one. Isaiah 53 12, therefore I will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with the strong because he poured out his life unto death and was numbered with the transgressors and was numbered with the transgressors. Aha. But there's even more last line here in Isaiah 53 12, for he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. And in fact, as he is numbered among the transgressors in Matthew 27 crucified between these two criminals, he is also intervening on their behalf. He is the intercessor. He is bearing the sin of those two people. And so the payoff from Isaiah 53 12 with just the visual, the image of Jesus being crucified between these two guys, especially as it pertains to the whole point of why Jesus is going to the cross. It's that's pretty profound payoff. It's a pretty big deal. Again, Luke is hitting a different point of emphasis than Matthew and in light of that, I think it makes sense that Luke would hit this detail and hit it hard. And in light of that, I think it also makes sense that Matthew would not hit this detail and would not round it out to give us the redemption arc for the one criminal who had the change of heart and came around to see Jesus for who he is. Quick note, we're getting close to being done with Matthew here, which is kind of wild. I love this book and I'm having so much fun with it. And we are three years into this project as of I think this week, this episode marks three full years of working on the book of Matthew to try to get this in our hip pocket. And if I haven't already made it super explicitly clear, let me just say it right here. I really hope you will come with me for the next project for the next thing that we do. Esther, as most of you probably know, is the next full book of the Bible we're going to do together. We're going to be doing a growing crazy amount of work at that to tackle Esther in a way that is unique and interesting and absolutely drenched in an era in history that most people don't know a lot about. I've learned so much about Persia and the setting of this story. I think this is going to be amazing. And I am so hoping you are not only planning on coming along for this next book, but I'm hoping also that you see this as a good opportunity to invite somebody you care about to be a part of the conversation. Maybe it's a little overwhelming for them to think about jumping in at the beginning of Matthew and catching all the way up. But hey, getting in at the ground floor with Esther is going to be a great opportunity. And I've also got one more little thing that I need to tell you about the plan for when we're done with Matthew and headed toward Esther. And I'll get you up to speed on that hopefully a little bit later on this week. Thank you so much for being a part of this Matthew thing with me. And I'm super, super excited to go and tackle the next book of the Bible with you. It's going to be fun. And Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
