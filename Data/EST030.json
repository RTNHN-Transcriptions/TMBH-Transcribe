It's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and if I sound extra chipper today, it's because I finally got the video out that is the follow through on that bonus episode that I did a little while back where I took a map of the Bible world and I put it over the top of scale map of the United States, tried to match the projections and everything. I checked it a whole bunch of different ways, and I just published a really fun version of that episode that is really, I think it's shorter. I think it's more efficient visually than the podcast episode we did here. It's a little different arrangement on the map, but I think it works a little better. And then I set it up so that anybody who's a patron here or on the YouTube side has got that waiting for them over at patreon.com. If it's on the YouTube side that's patreon.com slash T M B H. If it's on the over here side, it's patreon.com slash T M B H podcast. So if you are a patron, please go check that out. I think it's a really slick, cool looking map that helps you get oriented with all of this. Which is going to come in handy with the conversation that we're going to have today because yesterday we were looking at the strange ascent to power of Darius the Great and the weird insecurities that haunted him throughout his reign regarding that. Insecurities that created some sort of weird monument complex that he actually acted on. And the beholdenness that Darius the Great had to all things Cyrus in order to consistently demonstrate himself as the restorer of the things of Cyrus and the continuation of the true Persian line of noble blood. All of that comes into play in Ezra four and five after the building on the temple stalls out because of resistance from the locals and the hill people who were left behind after Nebuchadnezzar's conquest. Some of the left behinds of the Assyrian conquest who maybe have made their way back down towards Jerusalem. All of these folks don't like the rebuilding and they fought it under the reign of Cyrus the Great and then they fought it later under the reign of Darius's son Xerxes and his grandson Artaxerxes. But Ezra pinch zooms in on the resistance, the bureaucratic resistance that happened under the reign of Darius. There's going to be a lot of Bible today. So let me put on my reading voice. Gather round young people. Here we go. Thus the work on the house of God and Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. That's the last verse of Ezra chapter four. Here we go in chapter five. Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Edo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. Then Zarubah the son of Shilthil and Jeshua son of Josodak set to work to rebuild the house of God and Jerusalem and the prophets of God were with them helping them. I am going to have my beloved dear friend Jeffrey who is a wizard music and podcast editing put links down below to the through the Bible one book per day episodes that we did on Haggai and Zechariah. I think those will be very helpful if you have a few extra minutes today to go and bounce over there and check out what they were saying. Bottom line is both of those prophets were like, what are you all doing? Why is this not getting built? Do you not understand the opportunity that God has put in place here by raising up Cyrus the great and having Cyrus the great do exactly what God predicted through the prophets of long ago that Cyrus the great would do? I mean, we get to rebuild the temple. Why are you not rebuilding? Because some people were mean to you because they wrote some mean letters because you really need to make fancy houses that look fancy and the latest styles that match the wealth and comfort that you picked up and became addicted to back in Persia. No, get cracking. Build God's house. Don't worry about your house. That is a very sloppy paraphrase of exactly what goes on in those two books, particularly Haggai. But if you go and read them or review the episodes, you'll find that it's at least in the zip code. That's basically the message. Well, it works. And the people start building again. They're like, all right, we got to get going. A lot's changed in Persia. As we talked about the last couple of days, Cyrus is dead. The empire has expanded. There's great bureaucratic infrastructure that seems to be growing by the month. We've seen regional leaders of this satrapi of this region of the trans Euphrates. We've seen them come and go already. There was some sort of dynastic struggle that involves some kind of shape shifter or something. That's what we heard. And now this new guy, Darius, is in charge. And now we pick back up with Ezra chapter five. At that time, Tatania, governor of trans Euphrates. Hey, I just mentioned trans Euphrates. And Shethar Bozani. I said, all of those sounds, just like the letters are there. I mean, that's kind of what it says. I did my best. And their associates went to them and asked, hey, who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore the structure? They also asked. What are the names of the men constructing this building? But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received. Okay, now we're getting into really dramatic, really interesting stuff. But it's not like a lot of the really interesting stuff that we've seen throughout the Old Testament to date where it's interpersonal or so and so loved, so and so, but they also loved so and so. And then somebody got stabbed and they tricked so and so out of their thing. And then there was revenge and there was a big balling out and there was a battle and there was a miracle. No, no, no, no, it's not that kind of drama that we get here in Ezra chapter five. We're getting a little more grown up drama, the kind of stuff that you weren't into when you were 11 and you liked superhero movies. No, it's the kind of stuff that you got into when you were a little bit older and you started to find out about things like Tom Clancy or who's the guy who did the firm Pelican brief? John Grisham. John Grisham. Just like that where the drama is all about behind the scenes, bureaucratic stuff and who can put pressure on the right person in the right way and it sounds boring, but it ain't boring when you really get into it because it's a little bit more reflective of the lived experience of normal people working through red tape and all of that stuff. So the scenario starts innocently enough. These guys are motivated to start building again by some prophets who go real big and cut right to the core of why the building isn't happening and they're like, you know what, you're right, we got to build. And so they start building, but immediately some busy bodies who need to look like they do something to justify their large salary go trotting out with their little spectacles on and they're like, I'm not seeing the proper permitting for this. Could I speak to whoever is in charge of the building? I need to review all of your paperwork to make sure it's in order. It's that guy. That's huge. Nothing personal. That's your job. I wouldn't use that voice if I was talking about you if you need to check on something important like electrical work or plumbing or something that could actually affect people's structure or integrity. I'm really grateful for the work that you do. But this guy, I'm making fun of him. This Tatini guy, he seems a little bit sniveling to me at first and his underlings seem sniveling as well. But as we read a little bit further, we see that maybe this isn't justifying their own existence. Maybe in fact, this is scrupulous and smart and maybe the way they're crafting this is out of sympathy to the Jewish people because the letter that they write back is relatively even handed compared to the letter that we read in Ezra chapter 4. For our purposes today, I just think it's worth noting that the work isn't fully coming to a stop, but the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply may be received. That's why I think I need to recant on the whole calling Tatini a Weasel thing because the weasily thing to do would be like, no, everybody here is just going to have to not work until I can get some answers and that's going to take at least months. So everybody just go home. So I would like to apologize to Tatini and any of his descendants who may trace their lineage back to him. He did allow the work to go on and that deserves to be acknowledged and that is credited by Ezra to God. It's another one of those places where the author of this book views God as providentially aligning details that are decided by a faraway king who theoretically doesn't care about or believe in this God of Abraham at all. The text holds out God as being the one who's orchestrating all of this stuff to keep the progress going. Last thought on how all of this works. Sometimes in storytelling, if there isn't a clear timeline threat baked into the plot, you don't really feel it's like, well, I mean, the characters could, I mean, they could just work on this for 30 or 50 years and kind of get to it when they get to it. All good stories like this build in some kind of timeline threat whereby if you don't get this done in a certain window, it's not going to happen and your good efforts will be thwarted. Here we're seeing that the further away we get from the edict of Cyrus the Great in 538, the more the resistance gets momentum to stop the building. We're theoretically two, maybe three, maybe four kings later from Cyrus the Great and his legacy is starting to fade a little bit. Now there's an opportunity here though because Darius is very beholden to Cyrus. So we need to hurry. We need to keep this building going right now or this little window of opportunity may close and we may never get this temple built at all. So that is the point of tension we are sitting with. The building is barely still going, but it may be shut down forever. And if so, could it ever be resumed ever? And then we're going to find out what this letter to King Darius was about and what happened in response to it. It's time around. Please don't forget to go check out that map video I made over on the Matt Whitman YouTube channel. And again, if you're a patron here or there, there's a free high res version of that that I put there for every patron at every level to download and use however you want. I'm having a great full of you and give me credit for it or whatever. But even if you don't, I secretly won't be mad. Just go make use of that and hopefully it proves to be helpful in orienting yourself more deeply to this story that we're throwing all of this time at as it has been for me.
