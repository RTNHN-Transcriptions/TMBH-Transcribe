I know that from where you sit, it feels like we just did this yesterday, like we do every day. Yeah, but sometimes I travel. I don't want to take all this stuff with me, so I work ahead a little bit. And that's been the case here for about the last week and a half. My kids went to a free Lutheran National Youth Conference in Colorado. It was held at a place where I went to a couple of leadership conferences when I was a kid, so that was pretty cool. I think they had fun up there. And my wife and I went and did a little pre-andiversary anniversary trip and hung out in the mountains and fished and enjoyed each other's company. I am reminded that she's still absolutely my favorite person I've ever met to hang out with. We had a wonderful time. In some of the in-between times, I sat around and thought about what you and I are working on here and how excited I was to get back to it. And I am, by the way, I don't take this for granted. I look forward to sitting down at the microphone and doing this every day because the fact that you care about this stuff and I care about this stuff and we don't even all have to think exactly the same things about it. And we don't have to put on errors. And I like we know all the things are some kind of Bible geniuses, but we can just think about it together. That is such a gift and it's a gift that you give me. And I'm really grateful for that. And so I always look forward to getting back at it. But I was thinking about where we're at in the Book of Esther and the whole proposition and how we did 40 episodes of history, which for some of you was like, more for some of you was like, that was plenty. Thank you. Never do that again. But either way, man, we did all of that. And now we're into the story and the setup stuff and the first two chapters that we're just wrapping up today. It's a lot. But from here on out as we pivot from chapter two to chapter three, it goes fast. This is action packed and we're going to be done with Esther before we even know it. It's going to go so quickly. The drama is so much fun. It's just going to fly by is the point. And so we need to start thinking about what we're going to do next. And I have not officially decided. I got a couple ideas that I think strategically would be pretty fun, pretty cool. But I would really love input from you. So I'm opening up a thread at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast. Everybody who's a patron at any level of the program, you're going to get to have input on this next decision. Obviously, you're not all going to agree. So I can't do all the things that everybody wants to do at once. But I'm going to open a thread there. I'm going to see if there's some kind of consensus or impulse here from you about what you think would be really interesting to do next. And then we'll make some decisions. I'll let all of you over there know what the plan is first. And then I'll come back here and publicly announce it. And I don't know. I'll probably whip up some little books or do something fun to commemorate where we're going next. But not until we got Esther in our hip pocket. We got a ways to go on that. So all that said, wonderful to be back with you. I missed doing this. Let's look at the end of Esther chapter two. The last few days we've been talking about Mordecai who is sitting in a place where you can still go and look at it. Historically, we know where it is. He even got an inscription on Xerxes signed the thing. That's the gate. That's the town. That's where it's happening. And apparently Mordecai was one of these gate sitters who even Herodotus records was a thing. It wasn't just like a lazy bum who allows by a gate and was begging for stuff. No, the person who sat there was somebody who was maybe even a part of like the judicial processes like somebody on the front end of gaining an audience with the king. Maybe Mordecai even played that kind of role. And whatever the case is a position of honor for him to even be allowed in the entryway, the gate to the king's presence. And while he's there, he catches on to something that's going on. That's a really big deal. During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, big than and terish, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king giving credit to Mordecai. And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were hanged on a gallows. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king. Okay, a few little micro details here that we just need to round out from looking at this earlier. Mordecai, he's eyes up, he's attentive, he's paying attention to things. He's not some kind of revolutionary. If he was, he might have felt that since chaos is a ladder, he could just let Xerxes get assassinated. And maybe in the ensuing pandemonium, his people could somehow benefit from it or he could gain power. But no, instead, there's kind of this theme of even if it's not your favorite authority figure Mordecai sizes it up. And he's like, no, that's the one who God has in charge right now for whatever reason. And Mordecai's decision to effectively spare King Xerxes. He has Xerxes life in his hands. And he chooses to spare the king. It's a little bit echo E of David choosing to spare King Saul, even though King Saul wasn't a very likable king back in the day. So Mordecai's put in this position of great power and he chooses to use it to stick up for a pagan king. All right, interesting. Well, somehow Esther is able to gain access to Xerxes. I mean, obviously the theme of access to the king for Queen Esther is going to be huge as we move ahead in the story. But it says Queen Esther in turn reported it to the king and she gave credit to Mordecai. Well, maybe there's just like a special exception where you could just bust into a room if you knew the king was going to get assassinated without permission or anything and be like, Hey, sorry. I know everybody's doing something, but there's an assassination plot. You're about to get assassinated. You should put on like your anti assassination helmet outfit or whatever you wear when you want to not get assassinated. And then the king is like, okay, normally I do not like it when people come in here on and out. That is not my favorite thing. But since there was an assassination, I'm going to allow it this time. We don't know why or how Esther was able to gain this quick access to Xerxes, but presumably he was just in a very forgiving mood with access to him or people who didn't totally honor all of the protocol since it resulted in him not being killed because then they do go and investigate and sure enough, Esther, who I think probably took a risk in telling him. She was wrong. She's not bad right there, but she comes out looking good and Mordecai, who she gives credit to comes out looking good as well. And all of this gets written down. And if you remember back to Ezra and some of the stuff that we looked at there, we know the these guys, they got a lot going on. And so the idea of the annals of the king is a really big deal. And the stuff that he says that gets written down in there is binding, but also it's forgettable. And nobody's sitting around remembering all of that stuff, but it's almost like case law in that if anybody can go back and dig through a decision or a proclamation of the king and they can present that right here. Like, no, this is a sign and seal. This was the date right here. We found this particular thing that you said on a scroll in Ekbattana, even though it was a long time ago, like, so let it be written, so let it be done. This is official discounts. It was binding. It's an account. And so it's there and it's official. And in the background of your mental image of Susa, you picture this big fanon and this terish fellow who might have been really nice people. Maybe they're just having a horrible week and things just got out of control with office, gossip and escalated and they didn't have any other thing that they really related to each other about. I mean, come on, we've all had toxic relationships before. They just go sideways. I've just never had one that resulted in an assassination attempt that these guys did. So I mean, tough deal for them. Maybe we just started catching them on their worst week ever, but one way or another, they're still, I mean, they're still impaled on polls. It just seems like these accumulated emperors, they really, they really like to impale people who tried to kill them or irritated them in some way. So they're just impaled. I think they leave them up there for a real long time. So there they are stuck on a thing. For whatever reason, this is always translated as hung, but hung just doesn't neatly translate from some of these ancient languages in terms of what was done to them. So we know from even the language back over in what was it, Ezra six, I think I got it wrong the other day when I was saying it's Ezra six, we know that this is the means of execution that was favored by Darius and his sons, Xerxes for people who were treasonous or defied his wishes. Oh, that reminds me real quick. Side note, I got something wrong the other day. What was it? What was it? It was Vancouver. I said Vancouver, Washington is the stand in town for all of those Hollywood shots. And but it's not. It's Vancouver, British Columbia. What was I doing? Matt, I mean, there is a Vancouver, Washington and all is just not the right town. Super embarrassed. I've been eating at me for this entire vacation. Come on, Whitman, trying to get people to trust you. The Bible things screw basic geography. It's embarrassing. Pull yourself together. But the point is here we are at the end of Esther chapter two and stuff has gone really well. Esther won the contest as readers. We don't really have to pass any moral judgment about anything in terms of how all of this went down. The author cleverly phrases it all. So it's just not our job to really worry about it. We're allowed to just be along for the ride and root for this crafty shrewd clever, lovely young lady, the heroine of the story and her benefactor Mordecai. It's awesome. There's a banquet. It's awesome. I'm sure it was the best of banquets. And then immediately Xerxes decision pays off. He's vindicated. He looks brilliant because the lady he picked. She has a buddy, a family member who immediately saves him from death and he didn't even have to do that. So Xerxes gets spared and the bad guys get caught and Mordecai gets credit for all of it and it gets written down and the official stuff. And we get to the end of chapter two and we're like, awesome. Things just keep getting better. And in fact, things keep getting better so much that I'd like to hear more about what rewards come Esther and Mordecai's way at the beginning of chapter three. So we turn the page and let's find out very next line, Esther 3-1. After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman, son of Hamedith, a vag-gite elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles. What? Well, it doesn't, I mean, that's just the needles sliding across the record. What are we doing here? Maybe I missed a page? That is chapter three because I mean, what about what does Mordecai get? Is it, he didn't have to help Xerxes. He can just let him die. I mean, nobody ever would have known. Huh. Nope. No, I've determined that that is indeed the next phrase here in the Bible. And it would appear that what the author is trying to do is shock us with how much that doesn't make sense. It should read after these events, King Xerxes honored Mordecai the Jew, then elevated him and gave him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles because what he just did. If we're kind of loud, Herodotus tells us that Xerxes' dad, Darius, kept this long record of people who'd wronged him and righted him and some guy who gave him a coat years earlier and some market cleared out west. He remembered that and then he helped out the guy and did like a whole war for him because of a coat one time. This guy just saved Xerxes' life and he's elevating some other dude. All right. We're going to look into who this dude is and why this weird reversal is coming right here, why it matters to the story and how that sets up the pressure points and the action that is about to start flowing. Okay. Again, if you're a patron in the show over at patreon.com slash the TMBH podcast, I'm going right now to a computer and I'm going to open a thread to get your feedback, your thoughts, your strategic philosophy of what we should be doing here so we can work toward making a decision officially about what the next thing we're going to do is after Esther. But in the meantime, so much more Esther to happen. It's nice to be back. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
