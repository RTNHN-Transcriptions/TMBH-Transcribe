    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Galatians. Galatians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to a whole bunch of churches that he started in modern day Turkey, Asia Minor. It's probably one of the earliest letters that was written in the entire New Testament, probably one of the earliest books of the New Testament. It is meant to tackle a very specific problem that had arisen. Here's what happened. Paul went out on one of these missionary journeys and he founded a whole bunch of churches in Asia Minor. And stuff's going pretty well there. They were hard won churches. Paul took some pretty serious abuse to get those things down. He probably had the equivalent of a tattoo for each church that he founded there in the form of some sort of scar or lash or cut or injury that he took with him. And after carefully establishing these churches and establishing leaders, along come these super zealous Jewish Christians up from Jerusalem who heard a rumor that somebody somewhere wasn't acting Jewish enough and they weren't doing the whole Old Testament law. And you can't be a follower of our God if you don't do the whole Old Testament law. And so in their zeal, they go and track down somebody somewhere who still isn't doing the right thing. I think this probably had to have broken Paul's heart to an even extra degree because that's what he did. That was his mistake. He was super zealous for Jewish stuff in Jerusalem. And then he heard rumors that there were people outside Jerusalem who were still saying things that were wrong about God and he was going to go get them and imprison them and punish them. These hyper aggressive Old Testament minded Jewish Christians don't understand the Jesus thing yet. Paul is going to get them and resonate with them, but also he's losing patience with them as they go and do all kinds of damage and tear up the good things that are happening in this region of Galatia among these fledgling churches. So he writes the letter of Galatians, which would have been circulated among these churches. Maybe he wrote multiple copies. I don't know exactly how he did it, but it would have been read in public. And it's a repudiation of the teaching they're getting from these very aggressive Jewish as Paul calls them agitators who showed up to try to make the Gentile Christians obey the entire Old Testament law. And let's not be around the bush here. The particular thing that they were going to want to see happen that was the hardest dividing line between is this happening or is it not would have been the sign of the covenant with Abraham from way back in Genesis. And that is of course circumcision among the males. I mean, it's not exactly a super attractive invitation for outsiders who were thinking about signing up for church. So yeah, we can do it, but you just got to go in this little shed and we got this little thing. We roll out these instruments and you'll hear them kind of clinking stuff like a torture chamber, but we're going to do that and it's going to happen. Obviously, Paul could see that maybe wasn't the best marketing, but as Galatians unfolds, it becomes very clear that his bigger concern is that there's no life in that. That Jesus has fulfilled the law that is prompting these Jewish super Christians to come up and say, everybody needs to get circumcised and do all the law stuff. Jesus has fulfilled that. It's completed in Christ. Remember the lesson we took away from the Old Testament? We tried every single paradigm that included human effort and humans couldn't hold up their end of the bargain. We needed a new paradigm, a paradigm where all of the lift was on the shoulders of the God who wants to redeem because we're not capable of getting out of our own way. Now you Jewish Christians, you're coming up here and you're trying to inflict the thing that clearly didn't work on top of something that clearly is working. You're taking the old broken paradigm and trying to make it happen again or preserve elements of that. And so he writes this masterpiece, fast-paced letter that cuts down the argument of these Judaizers. Paul starts by defending his own leadership, much like he had to do with the Corinthian church and first and second Corinthians. He then moves on to saying that it isn't just him saying this stuff, but that Peter and the other founding apostles, they've all come to agreement on this as well, that this whole law is not something that is to be heaped on the outsiders. Now here we get an idea that this letter might have been written around 49 AD because in 50 AD there was a council in Acts chapter 15 where everybody got together and they were like, hey, we got to sort through these exact questions. They arrived at conclusions that Paul no doubt would have referenced in this letter to the Galatians if that council had already occurred. So in some ways it kind of reads like the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15 might have been part then inspired by the same stuff that inspired the book of Galatians. Well it's here at the conclusion of this opening argument that we get probably the most famous verse in Galatians. It's Galatians 2.20 where Paul beautifully says, I've been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, the life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. Moving forward, Paul accentuates the same stuff that he was really hitting back in the letter to the Romans that is all drawing on what Jesus said in the first of the five big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured. That's a sermon on the Mount. You will recall that right there at the beginning of that sermon Jesus said, don't think that I've come to abolish the law and the prophets. I haven't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. Jesus is the completion of the Old Testament story, the completion of the Old Testament sacrificial system. And then right after that you'll recall Jesus goes on to say in that famous sermon that your righteousness would have to surpass that of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Those were the people who made the rules back then in order to gain entrance to the kingdom of heaven. In other words, he's saying that to gain access to the kingdom of heaven by your own effort, you would have to be even more perfect in your behavior and conduct than you would be even if you got to write all of the rules with yourself in mind to make sure you always looked good. So what Jesus is saying is there must then be a right standing with God, a righteousness from God that is apart from human behavior, apart from the law. And that is what he's driving at here in the middle chunk of the book of Galatians. It's not about the law. Right standing with God only comes through Christ. You cannot achieve this by your own effort. And then Paul pivots to take in the Galatian churches back down memory lane, and particularly the Judaizers back down memory lane is like go all the way back to the promised Abraham. Remember, this was always to be a blessing to all the nations. All of the Old Testament anticipates that this was to go out to people like you're messing with here in Galatia in these fledgling churches. And you might be wondering, Judaizers, Jewish agitator Christian types who are here messing with other people's business. You might be wondering, why did God write the law at all then? And the answer is to point out humans inability, Paul says, to uphold the law, but also to keep things together until the arrival of the servant, the Messiah, Christ Jesus. And after this, Paul essentially does the Mr. Miyagi speech by me on the right side of the road, the left side of the road that's fine. But if you're in the middle, squish like great. Remember that famous speech from the karate kid? Well, it's the same thing here. Paul is saying you can only go all in one way or the other. You can't be part in on human effort to impress God and obtain access to the kingdom of heaven. You're either all in on the law or you are all in on depending on Christ for that righteousness. And anything other than depending on Christ to quote Mr. Miyagi once again, squish like grape, it's not going to work. Speaking of grapes, Paul wraps up the letter by saying there's certain stuff that is the product of human evil dating back to time immemorial. This stuff is inevitable. A corrupt heart separated from God cannot help but lust after these destructive things. But in contrast, there is this fruit of the spirit that cannot help but grow as God's spirit and the Christian nurture the values of the kingdom nurture the elements of the character of Christ in them and that fruit of the spirit of God in the life of Christians is beautiful. It's the stuff that everybody wants to see happen in themselves and in the world and that everybody wants for the people they love. It's love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and goodness and faithfulness and self control. And Paul says against such things, there is no law. And at this point, when he gets into the acts of the sinful nature and the very famous fruits of the spirit passage, he's kind of done talking to the Judaizers. He's already said his piece. In fact, a few verses before this fruit of the spirit stuff, he says about the Judaizers like if you're going to go the whole way in and trust the law for salvation, then why would you only cut off a little bit of skin in that nether region of your body? Why not cut off the whole thing? Paraphrase is mine. But this isn't a paraphrase. He says, as for those agitators, I wish they'd go the whole way and emasculate themselves. That is straight up in the Bible. So Galatians then is a very contentious letter. Paul is not messing around with the people who are like, well, let's go back to Egypt metaphorically. The people are like, let's go back to the old rules in the old way. I think it was working better back there. Paul is like, no, it is absolutely not working better back there. There is no life. There is no relationship or rightness with God or access to the new family of faith or access to the kingdom of God by your own work and your own merit. Rather, you are admitted to this new family of faith by the work of Christ. And after that, those good works that fruit of the spirit cannot help but grow. That is the correct order of operations because that good stuff only comes from the presence of God. It's both a fool's errand and impossible to try to combine these two approaches to access of God. Either your hope for a right relationship with God is about your impeccable behavior. You better hope you're very good. Or your hope for a right relationship with God is about the character of Christ and what he did on the cross and in the resurrection. When you picture the book of Galatians, visualize fruit for that fruit of the spirit. When you think about the theme, reflect on how Jesus completed all of the law and by doing so, made it possible for everyone to have access to this new family of faith and to his kingdom. Finally, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, and this is one where you've really probably ought to read the whole thing because the argument flows. Everything builds on top of what came before. But if you don't have time, make sure to read all of chapter five, which is going to take you on that dramatic swing from Paul's final spike of the football against the legalistic Judaizers, where he concludes by saying they should go the whole way in a masculine themselves. And then it swings back to the reassurance and hope that comes with the fruit of the spirit born out of a relationship with Christ, both for Jews and for Gentiles. We have leveled up our Galatians game next time around on to Ephesians. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
