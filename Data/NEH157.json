And Peter's like no I'm not, I'm never gonna do that ever even if everybody else does, I'm gonna hang with you forever, that's what Jesus buddy Peter says. And Jesus responds to that saying well actually not only are you going to abandon me and deny me, you're gonna you're gonna actually deny me three times tonight before the rooster even grows. And Peter's like pfft, even if I have to die, I would I'm not gonna do that I'm totally not gonna do that. And Jesus is like okay, that paraphrase his mind. Jesus didn't say like okay, maybe a page of Bible happens after that. And Jesus gets arrested and things are not going well in Jesus' trial. And Peter his friend is kind of skulking around the edges because I think Peter really does like Jesus and I think he meant what he said but he just couldn't follow through on it. And so he's scared, I mean it's understandable, right? Like your buddy just got arrested, he's gonna get killed. Somebody comes up to him here during the night while Peter's skulking about and they're like hey, don't I recognize you from hanging around with Jesus? And Peter's like no, definitely not. That is a different guy you are thinking of someone else. But then somebody else comes over and they're like no, no, no, no, you're the guy right from the thing. I remember you because I remember the thing I was there at the thing and he's like no, come on, you're thinking of somebody else. It's two if you're keeping track. And then somebody else comes over and they're like you're definitely the guy. I'm telling you I saw everybody this is one of the guys with Jesus. I saw him at the thing, slight paraphrase his mind. This is basically how it went. And Peter's like no, definitely not. You are all confused and you're all being weird. And then right then the rooster crows and he goes outside and he weeps bitterly. And that's actually the last thing that you ever hear from Peter in the book of Matthew is a pretty sad story, right? And you read that story in the New Testament and you can't help but go wow, how can you get that so wrong? There's one page ago you said that you were going to get that right, you swear on your life, you're definitely not going to deny Jesus and then you get it wrong three times, boom, like that. But then upon further reflection, you're supposed to go, I do things like that. Sometimes you get caught up in the moment or fear, insecurity or whatever just selfishness takes over and you can swear up and down that you're going to do the right thing when you're in one state of mind and then you just the practicality of the moment or whatever, everything flips and then you get it wrong a second later. I think that whole story of Peter immediately failing to follow through on this blood oath covenant swearing that he does to Jesus is really reminiscent of what we're getting here at the very end of the book of Nehemiah and in the same way that you're supposed to be shocked by how quickly Peter could screw it up but also then a second later you're supposed to be like, well, I guess I could do that too. So at the end of Nehemiah, I think you're supposed to be shocked by how quickly the people who just made a vow to do three things then went and violated those three things but then also after a couple minutes to reflect, I think you're supposed to be like, well, I mean, it could have been me. I do things like that sometimes. In this case, it's pretty ugly situation. The thing that keeps biting the descendants of Abraham in the butt is that they keep marrying into other people groups and it's not the marrying between people that is necessarily what messes it up. It's in this ancient Near Eastern context. Every time you do that, you mingle all the money, you mingle all the customs, you mingle all the language, you mingle all the belief and the religion and where the sacrifices go and it watered down the whole thing for this exclusive people group and of course, every time they intermarried and half worshipped another God and half worshipped the one true God, things got watered down to the point that it was barely recognizable. And that's according to Nehemiah, how they got into the whole mess in the first place of being slaves and in captivity, defeated by Babylon, owned by the Persians. But now there's been this opportunity to get things back on track. They made a great big oath. Everybody made the oath in chapter 10. A lot like Peter, no, we're never going to get anything wrong again. We're totally going to do all of these things. We are totally going to honor the Sabbath. We are totally going to provide for the household of God and not neglect it. And we are totally not going to do the intermarriage thing anymore. Well, in Nehemiah 13, we discovered that Nehemiah went away for a little bit and they immediately neglected the care of the house of God. And then we discovered that also Nehemiah went away for a little bit and they immediately quit honoring the Sabbath. And then most recently, we figured out here in the last little bit of Nehemiah 13, that Nehemiah went away for a little bit and immediately everybody started doing the intermarriage thing again and adopting the customs of other people groups and beliefs and all that. It's just the same problem on repeat. Here we go again. So Nehemiah explains the problem in verses 23 and 24 of Nehemiah 13. Moreover, in those days, I saw men of Judah who had married women of Ashdod Ammon and Moab. Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples and didn't know how to speak the language of Judah. They couldn't even hear the words of God and the language in which they were written because they didn't know it. Well, Nehemiah has been a man of action in the past. What's he going to do this time around? Verse 25, I, Nehemiah, rebuked them and called curses down on them. Dang. Well, for that to be anything other than impotent and ridiculous and mockable, you've got to be somebody who's got a lot of credibility and a pretty decent following and somebody who's operating from a position of massive moral authority. And apparently Nehemiah is just such a guy. What else is he going to do? Oh boy, I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair, period. Huh. Okay. Well, theoretically, we are against religious violence. I would be against somebody in church, beating someone and pulling out their hair. But you know what? Truth to be told, I've kind of wanted to do that a few times. I've seen people claim to believe a certain thing and hold a certain set of values and then wantonly and willfully and defiantly blow up something beautiful on purpose. Just like the moment when Bilbo refused to give back the ring and you can just see the evil come over them. No, why shouldn't I have this thing that I want? You're like, Oh my goodness, you probably need to be beaten and to have your hair pulled out. What does the matter with you? I've never done it. I probably will never do that. So I get the impulse, I guess, to want to, when people who claim to believe a certain thing just wantonly, willfully, destructively, ruthlessly, cruelly, ignore all the things that they pledged themselves to. I don't know, maybe I've had that come in at times here or there. I mean, I like to think that most of the stupid stuff I've done is because of stupid, just not paying attention or well intentioned and I got it wrong or just inattentive and oh, wow, I should have been more thoughtful. That wasn't very helpful. But no, I can even think of a few things over the course of my life where I'm like, no, it's me time and I'm going to be selfish and I'm going to say something mean right now. I'm going to do it or whatever it is. And so maybe I've had it coming as well, but jokes on you, Nehemiah or whoever would want to correct me. I don't have any hair to pull out. All that said, theoretically, you don't want to beat people in a religious setting, but I don't know, different time, different context, different stakes. I mean, if somebody gets something wrong church or in a church community, they tear up their family. They hurt people they love. They deeply damaged their children. That's pretty bad. Maybe beating worthy. You're not allowed to do it in our culture, but in this culture, it was that horribly destructive for their family. But also, Nehemiah who's steeped in this story can draw straight lines between we violate God's commands. He punishes us. Those are the literal spoken terms of the covenant that has been around at this point for a thousand years. This isn't church. This isn't a liberal democracy in modern times. This is a covenant community whereby if they meander too far collectively from the commands of God, God sends an empire to crush their temple and take them away into slavery. Their collective consequences for the moral failing of the group, the deal God made with them and that they agreed to is very clear. If they obey God, everybody's going to know that he's the one true God because he will bless them in ways that don't make any sense. If they disobey God, everyone else is still going to know that he's the one true God because he will punish his own people in ways that according to the laws of history and time and space don't make natural sense. Either way, everyone is going to know that he's the one true God and he will not be mocked. Nehemiah has got a hundred data points to support that this is indeed exactly how it works. And so in the grand scheme of things, a little bit of beating and hair pulling in this context, maybe makes more sense than it would in other contexts. I don't know. Am I arguing for beating people and pulling out their hair right now? Maybe I am many given context. I don't know. I hope that I don't ever beat anybody or pull out their hair and I hope that nobody beats me and claws helplessly at where my hair should be. I made them take an oath in God's name and said, you are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves. And it's cool that he made them take an oath in everything. But again, per our earlier conversation about Peter saying one thing and then doing another thing one page later, may I remind you that they took an oath to this exact effect with their names and a seal of their family crest and everything right back here. This many pages earlier, three pages earlier, they all agreed to this. We promise not to give our daughters in marriage to the people's around us or take their daughters for our sons. It's the same vow they just took at what point are these vows not worth the air they are breathed upon? But I got to respect Nehemiah's persistence. He knows there's something really big at stake here and that this seemingly harmless gesture over a huge sample size of history has proved itself to be their Achilles heel. This is our downfall. Don't do it. And a little bit of beating and hair pulling is far better than the consequences of if this doesn't get checked. Also, in the same way that I look at the story of Peter back at the beginning and I'm like, man, idiot. And then two seconds later, I'm like, uh, yeah, kind of me. I kind of relate to Peter more than Jesus in that story. So I look at this story and I want to relate to Nehemiah more, but probably I relate to the idiots more. There are lots of good things that I have intended to do and then just forgot or was selfish or whatever. I don't know. The whole dang situation, all of it, the Peter thing, the Nehemiah thing, the whole Old Testament, all of it begs for a solution that is more potent than my willpower than Peter's willpower than these guises will power. It's going to take something more. And that really is, I think, what the whole Nehemiah thing is ultimately going to set up as we get toward the home stretch here. I'm Matt.
