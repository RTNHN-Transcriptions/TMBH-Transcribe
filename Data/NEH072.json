It's risky. I'm going to tell you a story about a couple of loans that I've taken out of the course of my life. One was a good loan. One was a bad loan. Obviously it relates to Bible stuff and what we're talking about. The book of Nehemiah and all of this business. It feels like I shouldn't tell you about this because it's kind of maybe private. I don't know. I think I don't care if you know. All right, let's do this. If it turns out that this was stupid and unshrewed and I should not have told you about my loans, then later I'll just delete this episode and replace it with something way, way safer and more saccharin. Most of you will never be any of the wiser, but for now we're going to try it. The first loan, which was not a good loan, was my student loan. I'm grateful that it existed because I went to a little private college. It was pretty expensive. Way out of my league, way out of our league as a family. We didn't make much growing up. But I was all right at baseball. My grades were good enough. I could sing a little bit. I got a scholarship for all of those different things. You mushed it all together with some work and I could pay for most of it. But I had to borrow a little bit. As an 18-year-old, I had no idea what I was signing. I don't have to repay this for four years. Are you kidding me? Four years is an eternity. When I signed that, I had been an adult for six months. You're talking about eight times the total amount of adulthood that I've done so far before I have to repay a penny of this. Yeah, sign me up. My wife, she's not my wife at the time, she took out student loans as well. We got married. Now we got two people's worth of student loans. I just had enough math on it. Now I got my first job at a college, which I'm pretty excited to announce. This was at Pizza Hut. I was a delivery driver. And it was very hard to pay back that loan. It was brutal. Every month it was like before we could do anything or take any ground as a young couple. We had to contend with this giant monster. We only had 30 days to do it. Then the clock would reset the new calendar month. And now we had 30 days to slay the monster. Again, it was a very heavy wait for a very long time. And for us, if something went wrong, the car broke down or something got sick, anything. That was a huge setback. How many more pizzas do I have to deliver to make that work? Then we went back and we both did grad school and more grad school and we're kids. We don't know any better. We're like, hey, we cannot have to fight the monster every month if we delay repaying these loans, which you're allowed to do while you're going back to school. So we're not going to pay them. We'll defer them. We did it all by the book. We told them and they're like, yeah, no problem. Defer. Well, then we start repaying them again after we do grad school stuff. We're like, well, what the heck? We paid for the grad school out of pocket. Why is this more expensive? Why do we owe more now than we owed before? Well, the interest stacked on top of the interest. Our loan got assumed by a bunch of different people. We consolidated it to try to save money. That was not a nice consolidation. We worked with the wrong people. It was pretty predatory. It was brutal. It was my enemy, my rival, my monster. Eventually, and it took a long time, we fully slayed the dragon. And it was amazing how liberating it was to have that monster out of our lives. I'm grateful for the education. I'm grateful for what the loan in theory was supposed to do. But wow, am I not grateful for the terms of it or the way it played out? It was brutal. It was a specter over our lives. Now, let me tell you about the other loan and I'll go quicker because we're a long ways into this conversation. Eventually, we got our feet under us. We bought a little house. We got the family and all this stuff going. And we had a fluke thing happen to our house. Doesn't really matter what. Wasn't anybody's fault at all. An issue caused by nature, but not something that was completely covered by insurance. I had a friend, a much older gentleman who went to same church as me, who was able to do the math on the situation that my young family and I might be in. And he came along. He's like, hey, I got money that isn't doing anything for me. It doesn't need to do anything for me. I can tell you have a need here. Let me do a loan to you. Zero percent interest. Use it to fix the problem and then you can pay me back on whatever terms make sense. It took a lot of swallowing of pride for me to accept that. But the reality is that any economic stability that I feel today is directly tied to the unbelievably perceptive and generous terms of that loan that that gentleman and his wife made to my wife and I. That was a life changing thing. And we got him paid back to his first priority, but it never felt like I was dealing with a monster there. It was a privilege to get to pay him back. Here's what I'm driving at. You and I have been looking at the book of Nehemiah, Nehemiah chapter five specifically. Nehemiah forts the violent advances of Sanbalat and enemies from without enemies who are not part of the returning exiles. But then we turn to chapter five and we discover that things have gotten really bad and that the economic crisis is in large part being caused by enemies within certain returning exiles or exploiting other returning exiles. They are in their darkest time. The monster they're trying to slay economically and in their personal finances is way meaner than anything I ever had to deal with. And Nehemiah, who's deeply plugged into all the stuff of the Bible, is drawing on all of the things that you and I looked at a few episodes ago, stuff that is clear instruction from God about how the descendants of Abraham are to treat other descendants of Abraham. Jews are not supposed to exploit other Jews. They're supposed to stand back to back. They're supposed to be this profound network of economic justice that is built into the system here. And while there is allowance in the Old Testament for charging interest to established people who aren't vulnerable from other people groups, there is no allowance for exploiting the poor from any people group and especially no allowance for exploiting or really even charging interest to a fellow Jew. And it does take an economic genius to look at that and say, well, it's very smart. It's very forward thinking. I mean, on the one hand, it's a good way to build relationships with your neighbors who are from a different family to do fair lending that involves interest really over the long haul. You're bringing capital into your bringing material value into your tribe while still providing real value and opportunity for people in another tribe by giving them cash on hand. They don't have to build things to develop things to get through a tight spot, whatever it might be. And so with the Old Testament and our last four days of conversation in view, it's not hard to see why Nehemiah was so upset. When I think of my own emotions regarding what turned out to be a very exploitative loan in terms of my student loan, maybe it wasn't that in the first place. I don't know. It's too far back and I was too young to know. But what it turned into is it got sold to other people or whenever we consolidated. That was predatory. That was screwed up. It wasn't right. What the terms of that loan were and stupidly, I signed it. I get it. That's why I ultimately did pay it off. And look, I was able to pay my bills. I got through it. I didn't have to sell any of my kids into slavery. And if I still feel as much sting over that as I do, as maybe you're hearing in my voice as I talk about this, it's easy to imagine the kind of complete and total outrage that Nehemiah is feeling over an economic injustice, an order of magnitude greater than anything I've ever gone through. And worst of all, that it is being carried out in direct defiance of the clear and express commands of God and societal established expectations from Jewish people toward other Jewish people during an incredibly vulnerable time. It's hot garbage. But there's one lingering thing out here coming off of these four now five days of conversation we've had about that. And that is, well, okay, well, what about now, though? I mean, any one of you has a 401k you're invested in something, any kind of retirement account, you are collecting interest theoretically from someone else, even if there's multiple degrees of separation from realizing that interest. I mean, you are interest kind of makes the world go round. We live in a debt society where we borrow all the time. And heck, even if you're getting interest on your checking account at the bank, you're also receiving interest pretty much all the time. Even if it's not always a ton of interest. So is this prohibition of the Old Testament carried forward into the New Testament? And if you're looking at the clock and you're like, well, that sounds like a whole big giant topic. How are we going to get this done? Well, we're going to get it done because this is not that hard. I mean, the answer is no, the prohibition does not seem to be carried forward in the most literal of senses. Matthew chapter 25, one of my favorite passages in the whole Bible is the one about the talents where the master gives three different servants, different stacks of money and clearly the expectation is go do something fruitful with this so that it is more money when I get back. He wants a return on his investment and the people who get a return. He's like, Hey, great job. Here's more. Go do more. And the one who doesn't get a return. He's like, yeah, you're fired. He's not happy at all. So that's pretty clear teaching from Jesus that an expectation of engaging in financial practices whereby your money yields a return that this is normal, normative, acceptable. Now, at times in the history of the church, Christians have looked at the Old Testament and been like, yeah, the spirit of the law is the same as the letter of the law. No lending for interest whatsoever. And there were people within the church who would lend with interest. And there are people who would not that sort of ebbed and flowed a little bit through the classical age and the Middle Ages. At this point, very few Christians will look at the Bible and say there's a general prohibition on all lending for interest. So the letter of the law, I don't get the impression that that seems to carry forward outside of the Old Testament Jewish community. But I think the spirit of the Old Testament law, even though all the ground rules of the world and society and the fact that back then you're talking to just Jewish people in a chosen covenant community and the New Testament is written to pretty much just to everybody. Despite all of those changes, I do think the spirit of the law comes through. Don't be exploitative. Don't be a part of sabotaging somebody else's future for your own personal gain. And it is a clear kingdom and Christian value. And according to the parable of the shrewd manager over in Luke, to use your resources in a way, resources you cannot keep beyond this lifetime to do kingdom things to bless other people to make redemptive stuff happen. In summary, Nehemiah is absolutely right in his historical, cultural context and in the context of the moment he was in in redemptive biblical history, he was right to be furious. And I think any of us today, regardless of our beliefs or where we're coming from, background, rise, anything, when we see economic exploitation designed to do horrible things to people to enrich a few by taking advantage of them and slaving them effectively with debt, we're right to be outraged by that as well. It's not loving to your neighbor. It's not in keeping with the kingdom values of Jesus. However, it does seem that the complete and absolute prohibition on collecting any kind of interest from your fellow countrymen is something that was exclusive to the covenant ethnic community of the Jewish people in the Old Testament. And that exclusivity does not seem to carry over into the New Testament. The collecting of interest even seems to be expected or anticipated as a normal, natural, even good practice by Jesus himself, yet still like that very, very wonderful man who stepped into my family's life at a moment of great need and gave us an incredible blessing that we were too embarrassed to even ask anybody for just like him. The option to do things that are unbelievably generous with our resources to lend on unbelievably generous terms, that's right there. And I certainly think that what he did was deeply in keeping with the spirit of what was being communicated in the Old Testament and I will be forever grateful for what he and his wife did for my family. And maybe even you're listening right now, my friend. Thank you for what you did for me. I'm going to try to give that away to other people for as long as I live. Okay. Now, and this time, I mean it for real. Next time around, we'll get on to the stuff where Nehemiah starts to solve the problem. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
