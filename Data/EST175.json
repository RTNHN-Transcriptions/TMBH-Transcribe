We all just saw the thing. Then a few days ago, I'm like, no, no, no, no, you can't gaslight me. I remember the thing from a few days ago as it was. But then a few months go by and that becomes more gas-slideable or more innocently, forgettable. Then a few years go by and memories start to clutter together and some dishonest desire for the history of how things actually were to be framed a little different or maybe even altered. Maybe that kicks in. If you really want to know what I'm talking about, follow a bunch of politicians on X or Twitter. It is incredible to watch them lie about the things that just happened. Some of us are like, but I remember the things and how they just happened. But many others are eager to say, well, that's my party and I happen to like this version of things. It's a problem. It's an actual issue. And clearly it was an issue in the ancient world that is forgetfulness and cultural re-remembering and reframing. And that is why so much of the early Achaemenid Empire has language and motifs and images and artifacts surrounding it that are all about historical memory. Remember what Darius did? They carved the whole story of everything about how he became king and how they defeated the shapeshifter, Magus, guy who was impersonating Bardiah and Darius and his friends were the only ones who had the courage to defeat the lie. And then there are warnings in that Behustan inscription on the side of the mountain in modern day Iran, north of the heartland of ancient Persia. There's stuff in there that's a warning to future generations. It's like there's an old man wisdom that Darius got that when you're a kid, you don't see as much, but Darius knew the story, the account, the memory of how things actually happened, that could become very pliable and very flexible. Darius is an interesting case because I think the best read on what happened there is that he cooked up a story and gaslit everybody into believing that it was true and that it had always been true, but he worked hard and fought hard to make that story happen and be believed. And so that inscription that he puts up is almost a way of saying to future kings, wink, wink, nod, nod. Do you know how hard it was to pull this off? Do you know how hard it is to maintain this? Okay, well then don't deface this inscription. Don't mess with it. But Darius knew that memory changed, history changed. Xerxes knew that. It's part of why we get all the language about these irrevocable things. It's part of why we get the language about Cyrus and his decree and how everybody knew that if you could just go find the decree, it would be binding. It doesn't matter how many kings have come and gone since then. It's binding. Cultural memory. This is the through line of authority. It's funny because it's like the world has almost gone full circle in terms of the public memory and the memorability of things and how we remember things back then. You didn't have enough connectedness to the 127 provinces and all of the satrapes to control the narrative easily. You had to work really, really hard to do that and people didn't even know what your face looked like as a king. And then now it's really hard to control any kind of narrative or say what truth is or make memory work because I mean three minutes ago, it was goofing around on the internet and I saw there's an app now where you can just take a still shot of somebody looking into a camera and then use a quick video capture of yourself or just move around a little stick figure to make that person dance around on the screen. However you want, it's going to be so hard to know what's true at all in just a few months or years from now. And I think we have a crisis of remembrance on our hands that is about to happen. But it's the totally other end of how you get to a crisis of remembrance from what Darius and Xerxes were up against back in the day. Well one of our big ways that we push back on our crisis of remembrance is going to be some sort of clear trusted recollection or repository of things that are true with proof. That is going to become a commodity very soon. They're going to be businesses that emerge that all they do is preserve things that are certified truth in an inarguable way that's way better than fact checking. And back in the day, the way they counteracted the crisis of memory in the era of Queen Esther is with the royal archives and the royal records of the events of the life and the times of a given king. And we see that referenced a bunch here in the home stretch of Esther as we get into this sort of epilogue business here toward the second half of chapter nine and through the teeny tiny little bit that is chapter 10, we can see that the concern is remembrance. The concern is that people will celebrate this the right way. Remember what the point was, appreciate Esther and Mordecai for who they were and what they did. And as a counter maneuver to future people who might come along and say, well, it didn't happen that way. They didn't do it that way. It wasn't celebrated on that day. They were actually the bad guys as a countermeasure to those who would use intellectual memory warfare to try to out maneuver what Mordecai and Esther had accomplished. There's all kinds of stuff here at the end of the book that demonstrates that this is checkable. Final verse of chapter nine, Esther's decree confirmed these regulations about Purim and it was written down in the records. Remember the same records that get mentioned in Ezra and Nehemiah, the records that are binding no matter how many years have passed or how many kings have come and gone, those records, the records that theoretically can't be revoked or undone. If it is written down there, it is truth. It's like an epistemological vault for the mind of the Persian citizen. And then we go on in chapter 10, which we'll look at more carefully next time around. But in chapter 10, we see the same thing. Verse one of verse two, it says, King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire to its distant shores. That's great. And all his acts of power and might together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king had raised him, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of media and Persia? Time and again in the home stretch of this book, we are being told, hey, if you don't believe this or if somebody is telling you it went otherwise, go look it up in the most official authoritative places that you know exist. What would that be now? Huh, surprisingly difficult to come up with an analog for something now because we have this massive crisis of trust that we are just getting started on. Yeah, you can't say the news. You can't really say books because those have started to fall out along ideological lines. Wikipedia gets raided and attacked and edited by people of certain ideological bent one way or the other. You can't say Twitter. It's tough. I'm not sure what the universally agreed upon highest truth claim authority that you could point to someone to in our day and age would be the Library of Congress. I don't know, I look forward to hearing from you as to what that analog might be but clearly in the mind of Esther and Mordecai and Xerxes and Darius and eventually Arta Xerxes and Cyrus and Bardia and all of the officials and eunuchs and the noblemen and the citizenry and the sat reps governing the outlying satropies and provinces. All of them agree this is where truth happens and Esther is going way out of its way to say this is written down and real. Why is this so important? Okay, so one, we're trying to make sure that we remember and we remember accurately and that we gaslight slash rewrite history proof this story for future generations. But I think a second reason that it really matters is that like we talked about way back at the beginning of our time together working on Esther months ago, there are a lot of people who look at this and say, well, it feels like a fairy tale. It reads more like a fairy tale and is probably mostly made up. I don't think that I haven't treated it that way. It certainly is told with the lilt and flair and flourish and organization and delivery of something that is highly crafted to illustrate a point, but it holds itself out, I think, as being truthful. That's why you get these claims here at the end to say if you imagine that this stuff was all made up, well, I mean, you're in for a rude awakening when you go and look at the actual annals of the kings of the Medes and the Persians. And when you start thinking, well, I bet this whole Purim thing is just something that Jews made up to feel good about themselves. I don't like Johnny come lately holidays. This is a stupid bahumbug that maybe somebody would start saying that and then, well, okay, but Esther throws down the gauntlet and says, go look in the royal archives because it's in there. Purim is official and it dates to the right time and it's signed by the right people. This stuff is real. Now, look, could somebody have come along later and just written that down and been like, all right, it's in there. I call your bluff. And then nobody ever really has the opportunity to go look. Yeah, I suppose so, but it sure feels like a bold play from a very scribal preservation of memory mindset position to declare that the stuff you just read, it's real and you should continue to remember this and celebrate it moving into the future. More on chapter 10 next time around. Quick reminder, if you haven't gone back and listened to last week's bonus episode about the whole sticker thing, I'm really excited about the sticker things. Those have arrived. I've got three versions of, we just finished, Esther, level up, got this book in your hip pocket achievement unlocked stickers. One is going to be outlined in white and very soon. I'll let you know when that'll be available for purchase. I'm just going to put the cost on it that'll cover me hiring somebody to manage all of that and send it out. So you can get the white version of the sticker, but then everybody who's supporting the show, when I send out the Nehemiah Field Notes book for our next season, you're going to get one of those that has the gold outline as a special limited edition way of saying thank you for supporting this season and hoping that you'll stick with me in future ones. And then those of you who just did shockingly above and beyond things and you know who you are, I've got a very, very limited edition special hologram version of the sticker that I'm going to be sending to you as a thank you as well. For all of us, I hope that these stickers, which are beautifully made by my friend Bethany, will serve as a reminder and something that prevents future forgetfulness as a marker stone, as something of our own royal mental personal archive to document that we put in the time and the work on this together, that we made this a part of our lives for this little period of time, and that that is a pretty big deal. All right. I think that's plenty for today. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Do this again soon. Thank you to all of you who have taken the time to leave a rating and review on your podcast apps.
