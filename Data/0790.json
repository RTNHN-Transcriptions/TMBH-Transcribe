And then the adult side of the relationship would be like, because I'm the mom. And that was it. It was like, because of my authority in the situation, the correct next steps to take are clear and absolute. And now we're moving forward, sort of likewise, but not necessarily likewise in tone. So we see Jesus in this enormously important commissioning that he is giving the disciples now that he's come back from the dead and they've met up in Galilee. I think probably at the site of the Sermon on the Mount, but on some mountain up there in Galilee, it was prearranged. Maybe in Jerusalem, Jesus told him exactly which one they're all there and they're all gathered around. But Jesus is fully aware that they are doubting that they are struggling. They all have questions about the scale of this enterprise and what is next. Surely every last one of them has questions about their own ability to pull this off and play the role that they need to play. And Jesus is going to hit them with this gigantic commissioning to go and take on a gigantic task, but the reason or the thing out of which the whole commissioning is going to flow is his authority. And it's kind of an odd thing to hit because didn't he just get subjected to the authority of others all the way to death? I mean, Pilate is a man in authority and he said, Hey, all you underlings go and take this guy and flog him and then crucify him and they did exactly what they were told. The religious leaders, they have authority. They carried out a trial. They were able to refer judgment to Rome. And I mean, that that's power. That's authority right there. There's, there's a scene. Oh, it's in Game of Thrones. A show I don't recommend anyone watch ever, but it's a really good scene where Cersei Lannister, kind of the evil queen of that story and Ned Stark, kind of the every man. Good guy who tries to do integrity in the middle of a whole bunch of people who don't do integrity in a royal court. They find themselves in a courtyard and they're having a little tatatat and it's tense. And no, no, no, it's not Ned Stark. It's Peter Bailish, the weasel. That's who it is. And he's like knowledge is power. And then Cersei's like sees him and the guards just grab him. They just do whatever she says. And she's like, nah, actually that's power. Power is power. Coming out of what we've seen unfold so far in this story, we by world terms would be inclined to think the same way. The guy who has the backing of Rome comes along and gives orders to all kinds of muscle bound people with sharp poking instruments. And then they do what he said. There's a lot of power in commanding a legion. There's a lot of power in commanding the government. But what undercuts that here is one Jesus behavior throughout. He acts like one who has an authority that is even bigger than the state, even bigger than the sword or raw force. But then that authority is vindicated. It's made evident that that was a real authority when he doesn't stay dead. So in Game of Thrones, I guess power is power though Peter Bailish is somewhat vindicated as well as weaseling and knowledge does turn out to be another form of power for him. But here we're talking about a totally other kind of power with Jesus. We're talking about a totally other kind of authority. And Jesus clearly thinks that that authority is sufficient grounds to lay claim to the rest of these men's lives. Here's specifically what he says. So they saw him, they worshiped him, but doubted some of them at least. Matthew 2818 says, then Jesus came to them and said, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age. And I would just like to pause for a moment and acknowledge that that is the end of Matthew. Huh. We're not done. We still got to think about this authority thing. I've told you before, Matthew does the book end thing really well. Matthew does the C.A. motif through all the way to the end thing very well. So what do we have about authority back here at the beginning? You got this whole list of people at the beginning, this genealogy, right? And over all of this is the invisible providence and superintendents of a God who can manage this story. I mean, just even if you are just talking about managing the relationships and getting so and so to have kids with so and so, that's amazing. But all the stories that go along with it, all of the breaking of the laws of time and space and the providence of God, that is real authority. Then right after that, we run into a different authority figure, Herod the Great, who was one of the most powerful authority figures in any kind of recent memory to the original audience. But he looks like a clown. He can't outmaneuver a simple rural carpenter who has a couple of dreams. He can't outmaneuver some splendidly dressed and no doubt in this context, seemingly socially awkward outsiders from a completely different culture who probably didn't have full mastery of the language. He can't outmaneuver a little baby. His authority is a joke by contrast to the authority of God. Then what do we get in chapter three? The kingdom language really starts repent for the kingdom of heaven is near. When we see the authority of God bestowed upon Jesus, God the father and the Holy Spirit show up. This is my son whom I love with him. I am well pleased. That is an authority vouch in chapter four. We see Jesus lean into the authority of his father. And when he's done being tempted and he finally says to Satan away from me, Satan, well, then the devil leaves because this is actual authority. He walks up to some people in the second part of chapter four and they're working with their jobs that they go to where they work. And he's like, yeah, you know, dropping nuts. Follow me. And they're like, okay, Doki. And then they do. Then we get the sermon on the mount and I've covered this so many times. You remember, right? He uses yell at before I say it. What's the last thing that you get from the sermon on the mount? It's not a quote from Jesus. It's one little tag bit at the end that Matthew gives us where it says that when Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching because he taught as one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law. Then we see that that authority isn't just great speaking technique, but that authority bleeds right over into his interaction with this man with leprosy at the beginning of chapter eight. He has authority over uncleanness. He makes it go away and he has authority even over the rules surrounding uncleanness. He touches the guy. Then get this one. You want to talk about the authority motif being spelled out dramatically. I'm just going to read some of it because it's been a long time. Matthew eight starting in verse five. When Jesus had entered Capernaumus, centurion came to him asking for help. Lord, he said, my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering. Jesus said to him, I'll go and heal him. Get this. The centurion replied, Lord, I don't deserve to have you come under my roof, but just say the word and my servant will be healed for I myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me. I tell this one go and he goes and that one come and he comes. I say to my servant, do this and he does it. When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, I tell you the truth. I haven't found anyone in Israel with such great faith. What's the astonishment there? Well, it's the faith. But faith and what he sees Jesus for who he is. He's not just a guy with a golden tongue who can say some clever things and turn some phrases and move a crowd. He's a guy with genuine actual authority puts his own reputation on the line as a Gentile and outsider. He's got men who he has to keep in order who he needs to know that they'll do what he says on the battlefield under duress. He can't risk his reputation on idiotic superstitions, but publicly. He is so sure as a man well versed in authority that he is seeing authority and he knows what it looks like in the highest degree. So he behaves the way he does and is praised for it and his faith is rewarded for it. I'm kind of getting into the flow here. I'm thinking about this stuff. I don't want to interrupt that too much because I'm really enjoying our conversation. I'm just going to hit pause here because I know we're getting tight on time and we're just going to pick it up right where we left off tomorrow. All right. I'm Matt.
