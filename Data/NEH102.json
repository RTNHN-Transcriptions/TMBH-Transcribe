I was thinking about this. I mean, I don't think about this a lot. I've never thought about this before until just now. As I was getting ready to turn on the microphone, I think my answer would be a Shakespeare in the park play that I barely remember from when I was a kid. Maybe it was Julius Caesar. Feels like they were in Toga's. Maybe it was Julius Caesar. And it was in a band shell. Do you have those where you're at? I feel like that is not a whole world thing. I think the band shell is maybe more of a Midwest, Mountain West thing in my country. Maybe I don't know. But it's a stage that has what looks like a mermaid shell behind it. I mean, quite literally it looks like the packaging for a child's mermaid doll, like a half clam shell. And then of course, when you speak in there, it all bounces up into the shell and it gets projected forward, kind of like a big bullhorn wrapped around a stage. But even then, it's not that effective. You lose a lot of the emotion and the heart of what people are saying when they use that kind of a setup because inevitably you end up yelling when you're trying to talk to people without a microphone and the 200 or so people who I vaguely remember being present to that Shakespeare in the park event. I don't think any of them were there because they weren't familiar with Hamlet or Macbeth or I think it probably was Julius Caesar. They already knew the story. They were there for the event and the feel. It wasn't it's not the best way to communicate that stuff because everybody's having to yell all of their lines, which is fine when your line is friends, Romans, countrymen, but it's not quite as effective when it's the tender Calpurnia in the Caesar household at night, urging her husband not to go out on the Ides of March privately and quietly whispering things in his ear. The reality is that without electronic communication or without electronic amplification rather, you lose a lot of the tender stuff when you're trying to communicate with people in a big room. Most people can't do that. If you have to talk to more people, you have to talk louder and the tenderness, the emotion, the humanity goes away. Very few people could do this. There's one super famous guy who was good at it. His name was George Whitfield. He was an 18th century evangelist traveling preacher type and he worked on both sides of the pond. He was in the UK, England. He was on the east coast of the United States or back then the English colonies as it were. He was lauded by tons of people who remembered hearing him speak for being so human, so effective, so persuasive and emotional in his communication while also being able to be heard. It's very hard to do both. He was so good at it that famous deist, so this is somebody who thinks that there's a God that maybe set things in motion but that this God isn't terribly personal or still involved in the events of history today, famous deist Benjamin Franklin, not any kind of intellectual slouch. He was so moved by a Whitfield presentation that he famously said to have emptied out his pockets into the offering plate in support of whatever it is that Whitfield had just preached about. But there aren't very many Whitfields throughout history. Generally speaking, if you get louder, the humanity and the emotion and the persuasiveness goes down and what you're saying only works on people who are intimidated by yelling the louder you get. That's what Ezra is up against in Nehemiah chapter 8 when he's going to get up on this platform in the square that's right next to the water gate. That's a gate that had just been rebuilt by Nehemiah in the wall building project. We looked at it in the first seven chapters of Nehemiah and Ezra's going to get up there and he's going to read the book of the law of Moses. I told you yesterday I think this is probably the book of Deuteronomy we're talking about here. Maybe they're going through the whole thing, man. Genesis Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy could be, but the more Bible, the more voice that is going to take. And Ezra is trying to shepherd and nurture people whose hearts are soft at this point. They have a little bit of a sense of where they fit in the grand story of everything and they want to know the law of God and they want to respond to it. And somehow Ezra's got to get up in front of people without making it sound like he's yelling at them all the time and make this thing make sense. The goal here is not just to bark out all the words and tick all the boxes and be like, I'm Ezra and my job was to say the following words at you and I have now said the following words at you. They're respond as you will. Now he's trying to get them to get it. He's trying to give them what they are asking for as they request that he take the book of the law of Moses and read it to him. So let's see if we can get a little bit of a sense of how he pulled this thing off. So on the first day, Nehemiah 8, 2 of the seventh month, Ezra, the priest brought the law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand. He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Watergate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the book of the law. Okay, that first of all is very impressive because if I just started reading Deuteronomy right now from the very beginning and bear in mind, theoretically you want to be here. I think you want to be here. I mean, why are you here? If you don't want to be here, right? It's the internet. So you have control over where you go and what you do. No one can really make you do anything the time that you have for podcasts or videos, audio books. It's pretty precious. There's a lot of competition for that. So I'm assuming you're here because you feel like it. Nobody's making you do it. And yet if I just start reading Deuteronomy from the beginning, like I think Ezra was right here, I don't know if you or I are going to make it through the whole thing. These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the desert east of the Jordan. That is in the Arabah. I'm yelling because I'm trying to make it feel like I'm projecting like they'd have to do back then opposite stuff between Peron and Tofel, Laban, Heseroth. And do you see what's happening here? This is a lot that he was going to have to go through and how many chapters Deuteronomy have. I knew this a couple of days ago, but I don't know it right now. 33, 34 chapters in Deuteronomy. Man, that's a lot. And this guy's going to read it and comment on it for six straight hours and all the people listened attentively. Okay. That right there tells me something about what this presentation must have felt like. There is no way Ezra is up there screaming the book of Deuteronomy in a monotone at these people and them being attentive and interested. It's hard material. You and I have read some of it together. It's tough. I mean, the Bible is hard material, but that's some of the hardest material in the Bible. No, I think there had to be a degree of tenderness of humanizing and contextualizing going on, while still obviously being absolutely faithful to the text and what it says and what it means. I mean, this is Ezra we're talking about. Let's keep going. Nehemiah 8, 4, Ezra, the scribe stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Okay. Now I've been saying for a while that I think this thing felt spontaneous and I'm sticking to my guns on this. I think the people wanted this event to happen, but I also think these leaders are very attentive. They got their finger on the pulse Nehemiah and Ezra have at every turn. I think they knew this was coming and it wouldn't have taken that long given that they were in building mode and they had other tools out already to throw together this stage. It's a high stage. It's apparently a very durable stage because you can put a lot of people on there beside him on his right stood Matathiah, Shema, Anaya, Uriah, Hylkiah and Messiahiah and on his left were Padaya, Michelle, Malkaija, Hashum, Hashbada, Naz, Zechariah and Messulam. There he is again that Messulam guy. I didn't know he appeared right there. This guy's all over the place because he's listed twice in the rebuilding montage in Nehemiah chapter three, but also he's the dude who's intermarried into a family connected with Tobiah and so Nehemiah is telling us at the end of chapter six that Messulam is kind of one of the guys who's maybe a little bit compromised or his family's a little compromised by marriage. This guy's all over the place. It's kind of like a unsung hero slash interesting character in this whole thing. Who knew? It's a very impressive platform. It's a high platform and it's also one that can handle how many people was at 10. I don't know. I'm not going to go and count them up. 10 ish people are up there for sure. That's just who we listed, but I could imagine how being up high like that is going to give Ezra a little better attack angle to get his voice projected down onto the crowd. People can see his hand motions, his body language, what he's doing up there because this thing is elevated. Come on. That's thoughtfulness, right? That's intentionality that's happening here. Instead of just being like, well, you know, tough, if you all get the Bob Euchar best seat in the house treatment and you're stuck behind a pole or behind a building or in an alley, it's on you to find a space to squeeze in. And here he clearly wants to be understood. He clearly wants this September 27th, 444 BC event to go well and for people to internalize it and building that platform is a gesture in that regard. Verse five, Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them and as he opened it, the people all stood up. This is awesome. Their body language says, give us this material. We hold this in reverence. This isn't like normal bureaucratic paperwork stuff. This isn't like orders that we get. This isn't even like something that we get from the throne of Artaxerxes himself. This is a bigger deal and we will stand for six hours and listen to you up there on your platform reading it to us. I think that's really cool. I don't know if you do go to church. I know there are many of you who listen to this who you don't even know what to make of the God thing. So I'm assuming you probably don't go to church. I know there are many of you who are listening who do go to church or did go to church in the past. I go to church right now. It's something I really appreciate and value. One of the things that I love about how we do it is that so often when Scripture is read, we are standing and even participating in the reading of that Scripture. I think some of the rhythms of how my church does church, some of those cues are probably taken from Deuteronomy, which is in view here in Nehemiah chapter 8. This feels like a really good opportunity for me to keep my mental momentum here as we break down what this worship service looked like and how Ezra was communicating and emoting this kind of stuff. But time dictates that we're going to need to split this into two parts. So I'm going to hit pause there. We'll pick up right where we left off tomorrow. I know I'm talking about this a lot, but I really am grateful and would be grateful for any more help that any of you have to offer. The subscriptions on the new 10 minute Bible hour podcast YouTube channel linked down below are a huge help. Thank you. More of you went and did that yesterday. That means a ton. I certainly never want you to feel obligated to anything ever at all. You can just show up and listen to the thing. But if you're in a place where it makes sense to go over there, it's free. It doesn't cost anything to just hit the subscribe button on that YouTube channel. That would be awesome. I am seeing the results of your generosity with your time in that regard already. Thank you for helping me get that on its feet and up and off the ground. All right. More about how this service went down and how Ezra communicated to everybody next time around a mat. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
