This is gonna work. Okay in the same way That where I live sprinkler systems work different from time to time you have to blow them out because of the seasonal changes and how cold it gets and how Much of the ground freezes but in other places that doesn't happen So therefore you wouldn't have companies that go around and blow out the sprinklers you wouldn't have sprinkler system Blowout season in the fall in the same way that that is not a universal thing even though sprinkler systems are Likewise when the message of Jesus starts going out and it's totally gonna work I'm having fun right now when the message of Jesus goes out to the larger surrounding area that is outside of Jerusalem and Judea And out into Samaria and to the ends of the earth you got the same Metaphorical sprinkler system that is Christianity the same set of beliefs the same faith is going out to all of these places But not all of these places are the same stuff doesn't mean the same stuff in all of these places People and language and culture doesn't work the same way You don't have the same turn of a phrase to describe this concept as you would in another language and as a result Christianity in the early days starting right around here in Acts chapter 11 starts to look a little bit different practically speaking in some of these outer reaches these front tiers of where the message of Jesus is going Then it does in other places somehow that all relates to there being parts of the world where you got sprinkler systems That you don't have to blow out in the fall and other parts of the world We got sprinkler systems that you do have to blow out in the fall just Go with me. It's how today is how the things are in Acts chapter 11 Peter has come back and he's talking with the Jewish Christians like Gen one or Gen two of Christianity from the very early days from you know before These are maybe people who converted in Acts chapter 2 at the day of Pentecost or something like that And they're all Jewish and they have a little bit of a hesitation a little bit of concern that this thing is maybe going big It's going mainstream And then maybe they feel for a minute like oh this was cooler when it was a little scrappy independent thing that just we were doing But now it's getting to be big like it's getting all the way to the Romans I don't know if that's okay I don't know how I feel about that but Peter explains Hey the same miraculous stuff that God did to show us that this was legit in us He's also doing it in them I think we just got to go with whatever God is doing and assume that these people are Christians now We got to embrace them as brothers and sisters Even if we are on the opposite side of a pretty significant political divide here and Amazingly as we discussed yesterday All the people who heard directly from Peter at least there were people who weren't there who later are gonna still object But the people who were there who heard from Peter apparently they were all like okay That actually does make sense. Let's just go with it Which is great So it would make sense in the narrative of the book of Acts then that the next thing that would happen would be kind of a test case So this metaphorical concept of a metaphorical sprinkler system that is Christianity is going to exist in some new environments How is that going to look in these new social climates in these new environments? And we start by checking in in Antioch, which I think is in extreme Eastern modern-day Turkey But historically has been associated with Syria and on the lines change over the centuries so somewhere in there Now let's see what happens Acts 11 19 now those who'd been scattered by the persecution and connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia Cyprus and Antioch telling the message only to Jews a lot of important details in there Okay, first this proves that I wasn't just messing around earlier when I was like remember a couple weeks ago And I was like Saul is the guy who accidentally Sent the Christians out and forced them out of their comfort zone to go and do what Jesus said that is be the witnesses of Jesus to Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the ends of the earth So I mean Luke the author of Acts is saying the same thing right here But we find out they didn't just go to Antioch. They also went to Phoenicia and Cyprus Phoenicia historically is On the Mediterranean coast north of Israel It used to be before the time that we're reading about here in the first century Phoenicia used to be an absolute intellectual powerhouse with a powerful merchant class and all kinds of shipping and trade but pressures from the I guess it would be the late Persian era forced the Phoenicians out of the area north of Israel and south of old Syria and they went and started a new colony that eventually Became the headquarters of the whole civilization in modern day Tunisia and that civilization was of course called Carthage and Carthage almost won the game of ancient history and all the things that you know about Rome and all the things that you hear about Rome Almost if just a couple things had bounced a different way you could swap out Roman insert Carthage right there They were a huge deal, but they lost a series of three wars called the Punic Wars to the Romans during the late Republican era of Rome and Carthage even though they had the great and legendary General Hannibal who could even command elephants in battle even despite all that stuff. They still lost So the Phoenicians they have a bit of a reputation when that name pops up on the list Everybody in the original audience is gonna award the legacy points Culturally that Carthage also earned to this area This is a sophisticated people with a sophisticated history who just barely lost out to the Romans So dang if message is starting to catch on there, that's pretty stylish. That's influential Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean. We're gonna talk about that later on in the book of Acts So we're just gonna roll with that for now, but they're telling the message is the other important thing only to Jews Now immediately Luke is gonna augment that point though. He says in verse 20 some of them however men from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch Cyrene is in North Africa as well and began to speak to Greeks Also telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus The Lord's hand was with them and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord Now this is like a whole new strain of Christianity cropping up because These people who started it they're not they're not from the family tree of Peter and the disciples They're not from the family tree as best as we can tell of Paul These must be people who maybe heard the message from people who heard the message at the day of Pentecost So what we're getting here is our first glimpse at How much the Jesus thing has spread in these handful of pages since the day of Pentecost and now already? people who got Evangelized Missionary to in North Africa and an island in the middle of the Mediterranean now they're so excited about what's happened They're going and being missionaries to Greeks in Antioch. This is wild It's crazy that this is spreading this quickly. Well, apparently they're talking to Greek people now This would make sense the Greek was the lingua franca of the Mediterranean world at this point And it's not just that everybody speaks this language for business purposes It's also that Greek is a very good language for carrying the ideas of Christianity. It's a philosopher's language It's a metaphysical language. It's built To deal with abstractions with tremendous clarity So this language is emerging as a good vehicle a good carrier a good conduit of the message of Jesus And now it's starting to look like Greek culture or people informed by Greekish ideas and civilization are turning out to be fertile ground for the seeds of this message as well and Specifically Luke says that God was in it and a great number of people believed So wow just seemingly spontaneously a whole thing is popping up in Antioch So how dumb then would the Jewish believers in Jerusalem from earlier in chapter 11? How dumb would they look right now if they'd been like now, we're never gonna go along with that We don't believe it. We don't think that's a thing and then right after that this spontaneous new strain of Orthodox Christianity Pops up in Antioch. They're gonna have a goal over their face They really made the right call in getting on board with what God was doing instead of as Peter warned them against you know Pushing back against God. They can't oppose God. Let's just go with it news of this verse 22 Acts chapter 11 reached the years of the church at Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas to Antioch when he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts He was a good man full of the Holy Spirit and faith and a great number of people were brought to the Lord Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul then when he found him he brought him to Antioch So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch So these apparent outsiders who are Gentiles are putting their stamp or having the stamp put on them of what Christianity is of what it's going to be In just one chapter chapter 11. This is gone from I don't know who exactly is this for there's some debate To here we are at the end of chapter 11 and it's just crystal clear Okay, it's done It's over the cats out of the bag the toothpaste is out of the tube Christianity is for everybody Jesus is for everybody and now you've got this massive movement in Jerusalem But you also have this massive movement in Antioch and the climate in those two places Socially culturally religiously linguistically they're very different But the message of Jesus and Christianity is taking in both places So now what remains to be seen is what about the particulars of Christianity? How different will it look in these two places while still holding to Orthodox beliefs and how threatened are Christians from the one group? Gonna be by Christians from the other group who were doing things differently while my friends we are Are fixing to find out. Thank you so much for all of the anticipatory excited feedback that I have heard from so many of you about This new through the Bible series that we're gonna do over on the YouTube channel I am going to post a little clip a little preview of that over on Patreon I'll try to send that out as well as an email link for everybody who supports a program in other ways as well Just to give you a bit of a sneak peek at what this thing's gonna look like. I'm telling you It's gonna look really different than other stuff that I've done before My buddy Hunter and I I think we came up with a pretty different creative interesting new way to put a Person in the video on camera without having that talking person Be the centerpiece the center of attention of the whole thing and that was important to me for this It'll make sense when you see it at any rate We're a couple days out maybe three days out from actually publishing that first video of this big new series And I'm definitely feeling the nervous excitement increase as I get closer to that Thank you in advance for considering watching it and getting behind the thing and supporting this pretty big swing All right, it's plenty for now on to act chapter 12 next time around I'm Matt This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
