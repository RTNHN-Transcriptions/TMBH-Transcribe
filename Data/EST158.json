I don't know, the empire was kind of a new idea, and the idea of an emperor came with massive amounts of power compared with the political power players of the first century, BC, the end of the Roman Republic. And so nobody really knew what the norms were yet at that point during the time of Jesus. And Tiberius, he just more and more got interested in this pleasure palace that he built on the Isle of Capri down off the coast of Naples, a little bit south of Rome. So he's going down there all the time hanging out, and there are still ruins of this thing, and more than the ruins being intact, the legends of this place are intact. And they are juicy. If you're into that kind of thing, you can go and Google it, but I think I'm just going to skip it to keep it all family-ish. And so while Tiberius is out of the game, he has a right hand man, a vizier, a vizier, a vizier, I don't know how you say that. But one of those guys is in charge of his whole court and gets to act on his behalf. And this guy is actually the dude who appointed Pontius Pilate to be in charge in Judea. And ultimately this right hand man of Tiberius, it looks like he decides that he's going to throw a little coup and try to unseat Tiberius and take that power for himself. Tiberius gets wind of it and kills this dude. His name is Aelius, Sianus. And so Sianus or Sianus is out of the game. And that makes Pontius Pilate just an interesting side note, real, real nervous during the crucifixion season there toward the end of the earthly life of Jesus of Nazareth. But it's one of those situations where the leader just kind of gets bored and abdicates a little bit. And then it seems like weird things happen when you have somebody else in charge effectively stewarding the throne while the king is still milling around. The guy who Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon from that guy did the same kind of thing. He's really interested in like archeology and exploring the ancient world that was ancient in the sixth century BC Babylon. Remember there's a lot of history before that too. There were ghosts and legends and ruins and artifacts so that people back then dug in the dirt for also. And so the guy who was in charge before Cyrus's conquest of Babylonia, he was famously absent he as well. He liked to go out and dig in the desert and try to find out what was going on in the past. And the dude who ruled for him did a pretty lousy job. He's the writing on the wall guy from the book of Daniel. And so we see this pattern throughout the ages. It's not like the only time we run into this kind of political situation is here, but the situation with Xerxes checking out and Haman getting the ring for a while and the Mordecai getting the ring for a while is entirely believable. And when I picture Haman, sometimes he reminds me a little bit of Jafar from Disney's Aladdin. I don't think and not the live action one. I don't know. I guess a live action one too. The animated one. He's all cunning and clever and he's uses sweet words when he's around the indifferent, inattentive, rubish king. But really he's the one who's pulling all the strings and when it catches up with him, it catches up with him in a real big time way. But what would it look like to be the alias Sajanus or the bellshazor of Babylonian fame or the Haman or Mordecai sitting in and stewarding the throne for a king who's largely indifferent and do it well? How would that actually work? Because you don't really have all the authority of the king, even though it kind of looks like it. You peel back one layer and everybody knows, well, that's the guy who's running things and we didn't really ever swear loyalty to him. But he's in charge. It seems like a recipe for really corrupt leadership in really bad times. And of course, that's what we see in the first half of the book of Esther. Now in the second half, we're seeing Mordecai put on those clothes. We're seeing Mordecai play that role. And it's a little bit harder for me to imagine a steward, a sit-in for an absentee king that does things better because that kind of a political vacuum of power is just a bad situation. It seems like it's only going to lend itself to bad stuff. In Esther chapter 9, it seems like with each successive mention of Mordecai, he's viewed as more powerful and more fear-inspiring to the people of the kingdom, the people of the empire. And we see that even more spelled out right here in Esther 9 for it says Mordecai was prominent in the palace. His reputation spread throughout the provinces and he became more and more powerful. Now honest gut check for you. Does it sound spooky or does that sound good? I think just Westerners were well conditioned by history and our upbringing to get a little bit nervous and we start hearing about this kind of power being consolidated into one place. And I think that's probably a pretty good response. But it doesn't sound like the author of Esther is viewing this as a problem. It sounds like the author is like, and that was great because now instead of corrupt awful Jafar being in charge, we get Mordecai, a guy who sees things straight and is going to know what to do with the opportunity, how to capitalize on it. I mean, he's sort of the king's brother in law, cousin in law, uncle in law. I don't know exactly how that works. But he's sort of family to the king. The king seems like he's pretty tired and worn out of being jerked around by his advisors and is just looking for somebody who can have run the empire for what's going to prove to be the home stretch of the king's reign and the king's life. And Mordecai is the dude who ends up with the ring and he's the guy who has his hands on the wheel when the fateful day on the 13th day of the 12th month, the month of Adar finally rolls around. And this is what happens under Mordecai's watch. The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them. And they did what they pleased to those who hated them in the citadel of Sousa. The Jews killed and destroyed 500 men. They also killed her boy. Here we go. Parshandatha, Dauphon, Aspatha, Paratha, Adalia, Eradatha, Parmashta, Arasai, Aradai and Visatha, the 10 sons of Haman, son of Hamadatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. Again, Mordecai is the mastermind here. Why are the sons of Haman getting killed? Well, I mean, come on. Is it really that hard? If Mordecai is in charge, they're getting killed because Mordecai is trying to completely eradicate the line of Haman who it looks like, at least from the cursory glance, is somehow descended from eggag, the Amalekite, the rival of Saul, the enemy of the Jews from hundreds of years earlier, who Saul chose to spare and in doing so he kicked the can down the road so that this crisis would befall future generations of Jewish people. Some people are going to look at that and be like, oh, it's a good thing that Saul did that. And I disagree with the Bible there and the tone that it's taken with Samuel the prophet and how all of that played out. Other people are going to look at that and be like, well, it was holy war. Saul should have finished off his enemy when he had the chance to finish off his enemy. It's war. It's not a friendly thing. You can make of it whatever you like. But Mordecai's motivations as the new vizier or vizier of the king are really obvious. We're going to get rid of any potential threat that could possibly come from Haman ever. I don't feel great at all about the idea of how ancient warfare works. And I feel even less good about how political purges work at any point in history. And we're going to have to talk more about all of that stuff another day. But under the watchful, I have Mordecai. Haman's line is cut off and there is a political purge that runs through the city of Susah. I assume this is a picking off of all of Haman's political allies. All of the people who over time have turned over their cards revealed their hands as enemies of the Jews and with Mordecai. Now being the face of the Persian Empire, that's how it's being held out. The face that looms in the mind and the imaginations of the people out in the far reaches of the Empire in the countryside with Mordecai in that position. Well, everybody knows what his position is. I mean, his name is Mordecai the Jew. It has the Jew right in the name. And so people act accordingly. They assume that the edict that's come down from the king is serious and that it means what it says. But in the midst of all of this chaos with a steward of the throne governing on behalf of an absentee indifferent king, still at the very end of this paragraph, the author of Esther is very eager to let us know the following, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. And maybe you could make the argument that Mordecai has enough money now. He got Haman's estate. He's in charge of that courtesy of Queen Esther. He's sort of in law family to the king. I don't think money is ever going to be an issue for Mordecai ever again. So maybe you could make the argument that he didn't need it. He didn't have anything to gain from it. So he got his and then he pulled up the ladder and he wouldn't let anybody else plunder anything maybe. But I think there's something more here that we need to unpack about how the author of the text and Mordecai, this grand steward or vizier is viewing this as a holy war and not as a political war. And there is a sliver of difference in the ancient world between these two things. In a political war, you dang well take the other person's stuff. Plunders part of what motivates the people to go and do the warring. But in a holy war, I guess the motivation would be a little bit different. Yeah, we'll unpack that more later on. But here we are. The era of the effective rule of Mordecai, the great is now underway and well, it starts off with a bang. We'll unpack it more next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
