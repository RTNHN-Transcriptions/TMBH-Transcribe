It's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. And do you ever have a friend or somebody who you rooted for who just could not get out of their own way? They had everything in front of them that they needed to succeed and you wanted them to succeed and people were pulling for them. But it's like they felt this magnetic attraction to stuff that was destructive. And then people went and spent their own energy and money and time to pull them back from that impulse and be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't go that direction. There's nothing good at the end of that thing. Come in this other direction. Let us help. But at every turn, they picked the thing that was destructive. They picked ruin. And maybe you're thinking of a book or a movie or as I asked a second ago, somebody who you actually know, if you can picture it, it's one of the saddest story archetypes of all of the story archetypes. It's the one you connect with the addict or the person who has such low self-esteem that they just can't believe they'd ever be worth something. Or it's the story you connect with the person who is so compromised and has such an ugly, messy legacy behind them and cannot accept forgiveness and cannot find the humility to acknowledge the stuff they've been a part of. And so instead they sunk cost fallacy the thing and they double triple quadruple down on mistakes they made a long time ago that everybody else is willing to move on from but them. And the result is a wanton destruction that all you can do is shake your head as you look at it and hurt for the person who wasn't willing to steer it in a different direction but had every opportunity to do so. Likewise that's what we're dealing with here at the end of Matthew chapter 23. This feels like just this little statement of lamentation that we get at the end of the chapter, just this quick musing from Jesus. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I've longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers or chicks under a wing but you are willing. Look your house is left to you desolate for I tell you you will not see me again until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. What does Jesus mean? They weren't willing. Well that little verse right there points us to a gigantic narrative that has been unfolding since the dawn of recorded history, the beginning of what we would call the Bible that describes this pattern of humanity specifically God's chosen people who are not just representative of them. They're representative of the rest of us too. They're representative of all of our heartheartedness, all of our own capacity or rather I should say inability to get out of our own way and bend the knee to the king that is true and real. That story is a metaphor for the human inability to solve our own problems and to save ourselves. That story is a metaphor for the reality that only an outside force of good could step in from beyond the boundaries of our natural ways and solve these natural problems through supernatural power and supernatural love and grace and forgiveness. And so the whole story that we see unfolding from the Old Testament that Jesus is alluding back to in the previous little chunk of thought, all the business about from able to Zechariah, you killed all of these prophets. It's an ongoing story about the Jewish leadership rejecting God's purpose for them. And that again, lest anyone get on their ethnic high horse is a metaphor for all of us humans rejecting the purpose that God has for us, the truest, realest thing. The gospel author Luke in Luke seven something, 30, yeah, 30 even uses the same kind of language to describe missing that purpose. It says, but the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves because they had not been baptized by John. Luke's point is not that just physically the act of that water touching you is the thing that needed to happen. It's what it meant. It was another God ordained metaphor for bending the knee to the king and their refusal to do so was them having the truth of God looking them straight in the face and saying repent and turn from all of this rejection of the purposes of God in your life that have happened throughout the history of the organization, the tradition from which you're descended intellectually and spiritually, they wouldn't turn from it. They doubled down on it even though it's a violent mess. And even though the forerunner of the Messiah and then the Messiah himself was right in front of them doing all the things that the Old Testament said would happen when the Messiah would be right in front of them. They wouldn't do it. Why? Well, if you look at all the gospels, you see, because the Pharisees are the completion. They're the finalization of this arc of rejection of human failure to save themselves. They represent the pinnacle of self control and manicured face forward publicly impeccable behavior. That tomb is whitewashed, sparkling the outside of that filthy cup looks absolutely desirable, but inside is hypocrisy and death and bloodshed and ultimately a prideful rejection of the authority of God and his design for how to make things right. And so when Jesus said, I've longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing, much like the way the book of Matthew invokes the whole story that came before in the opening genealogy. So Jesus is invoking the whole story, the whole ugly, bloody, violent, resistant to God, thick, necked, stubborn, calamitous story of what we have seen up to this point that gets us to the place of needing this Messiah. Jesus can't solve the human problem. This subset of humans could not solve the human problem. The most religiously image aware, self controlled, accountable people in this society could not solve the human problem. There's something wrong with their hearts. And what we're getting here is the completion of a narrative, the completion of a story that rounds out this long dance between a God who wants to redeem and will redeem. He won't be thwarted and the people who resist that at every single turn. So as we look at the Bible in the same way that the lamentations of old take on this broad, sweeping scale and look at how it all fits together to point to the true depths of the true sadness of what is culminating in this or that moment in the Old Testament. So even more so, most of all, in the history of all of the lamentations, this little moment right here is Jesus pointing in the broadest of strokes to the whole story and saying, I wanted to draw you toward me. You couldn't save yourself, but I could save you a simple bending of the knee to the lover of your soul. And your one true king who you were told a billion different ways how to recognize is all it would have taken. But you were not willing. There's a truthfulness and a soft-heartedness to this lamentation that sticks with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
