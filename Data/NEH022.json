Music by", "url": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/thetenminutebiblehourpodcast/NEH022.mp3"}, "transcription_data": {"text": " I would like to hope that the following little anecdote I'm going to share with you is false and that it was just cooked up as a great big ridiculous lie to make people gefaw and to get the equivalent of clicks for some flailing, failing daytime TV show. But I saw the clip and it holds itself out as being a clip of a dysfunctional lady who goes on the show and claims to a panel of medical experts that she has always felt since birth, that she ought to be blind. And so then one day she took matters into her own hands and blinded herself with Drano. Do I think this actually happened? I'd really like to believe that it did not. I'd really like to believe this is just the kind of dishonesty that people are willing to engage in, to get ratings or make things work. Surely, please. I really hope that didn't happen. But it's the kind of thing that even if it's false, it's going to evoke a ton of emotions in the viewer because we all have this built in sense of a mistake you can't unmake versus a mistake you can unmake. And well, it, I mean, I did what it was supposed to do for me. I mean, visceral reaction, I felt to that purported decision. This is a very powerful one. And surely, you've experienced things in your own life, the choices you've made, things that have happened to you, mistakes other people have made. When you look at it and you go, okay, well, that falls under the category of we can fix it. We have a conversation, we have to put some stuff back together here, but nothing permanent has happened. We're good to go. But surely you've also experienced things like the purported situation on this nonsensical TV show, where your brain immediately says, okay, mental math, mental math, dang, we can't fix that. We can't go back. We can't unmake that kind of a mistake. It's entrenched, it's cemented. And huh, yep, that's a permanent step forward in a permanent direction. And I don't even know what to do. Yeah, I guess you just pivot to something else. And likewise, when Ezra here in chapter eight of the book, the bears his name shows up back in Jerusalem. And then as we get into chapter nine, when he gets there and gets the update on what's going on with the community, with the former exiles, the Jews have gone back to rebuild the temple and rebuild the people, he gets an awful update right out of the gate. He realizes that the metaphorical city of these metaphorical people is metaphorically overgrown with weeds because they're adopting all of the old pagan Canaanite practices that they were never supposed to adopt and be set apart from going all the way back to the earliest times in the old testament, all the stuff that ate the Jewish people's lunch back in the day, they're immediately doing again. And Ezra is horrified to realize that it's not just the normal common folk who were doing it, the priests and the Levites are even integrating these detestable practices, these awful practices of their neighbors into their own behavior and public culture and public life. But further, people are marrying outside of this set apart group of people, the Jewish people, and they're adopting the practices of their wives and their husbands that they're marrying from these other cultures that practice very different things. And Ezra looks at that and immediately one recognizes that this is exactly how they got in trouble before, this is how they lost everything. But two, he looks at it and quickly has the same reaction the viewer does to a story about somebody blinding themselves with bleach. Even if the story's fake, your brain goes, Oh, wow, well, there's no unblinding yourself with unbleach or undrainer or whatever it was. Ezra has that reaction and it turns his stomach and it makes him want to pull his hair out so much that then he pulls his hair out because he knows he's smart enough. He's a big picture guy. He's a big picture view of history. Dude, he thinks in movements of history enough to put his money where his mouth is. I mean, like a quarter of a billion dollars worth of his money where his mouth is. He thinks in these categories and he goes, no, no, no, no, no. This is the kind of mistake you can't unmake. This is Drano on your eyeballs. There's no going back from this. Once you all intermarry with these ideas, literally and metaphorically, and you have kids and they're raised with this mixture of ideas, there's no undoing these ideas. And so on the one hand, it's really easy to understand Ezra's horror and disgust as the initial report he gets to the state of the people is that quote, the people of Israel, Ezra 9 one, including the priests and the Levites. Dang, a two priests and Levites have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices like those of the, and this is just a criminal lineup of usual suspects of the enemies of the Jews through the whole Old Testament, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, parasites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites. So you get to the end of that verse and you're like, wow, okay, I can see it too. That's Drano in the eyes. You can't go back. Wow, Ezra, this is going to be a really tough job for you to do what you're here to do. But then I read with my modern sensibilities, verse two, I'm like, Oh, something about the way that's phrased. I think I'm not supposed to be upset by this. Verse two, they've taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them and the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness. And then Ezra in response to those two realities, Terris is tuning in his cloak, pulls his hair from his head and his beard. So I think this is kind of a wild emotional roller coaster for the modern Western reader to go through as we read this, because we live in a cosmopolitan society that probably should be a cosmopolitan society, right? Like that's the whole idea is that we don't live in Old Testament times, modern society, you know, a lot of people right now are trying to strip it of all of its Judeo Christian underpinnings. But I don't think it really works without them. Western assumptions kind of require the Judeo Christian underpinnings. But all of Western civilization, this post slavery, cosmopolitan, individual liberty, civil liberties, everybody created equal world that visionaries from the last several hundred years have tried to build that I happen to really like all of this really flows out of the idea of a new family of faith founded by Jesus, whereas brothers and sisters and mother and everybody who's a part of this family, they're all a part of that family because they do the will of his father. And so that is the unifying thing, not ethnicity. That underlying idea is what changed the entire world post Jesus of Nazareth life on this earth, because now all of a sudden there was an intellectual theological mechanism by which we could be truly one family instead of you look different, we're of different tribes, we worship a different God, this doesn't work. And in that regard, Christianity is even for the person who doesn't think there's a God, it's the greatest innovation. It is the greatest changer of culture and global culture in the history of ever because it transcended wildly, blew the doors off the idea of ethnic regional local deities and religions that would prop up small warring factions. And I have no trouble giving the Persians even a little bit of that credit, even before Jesus comes along. And the language of this new family of faith that transcends individual ethnic families comes to the forefront. I mean, the Bible has no problem with that. It absolutely credits the behavior of these kings in this regard during the Achaemenid Persian Empire to the prompting of God who moves the hearts of kings like a water course. But we're not talking about that area yet. That hasn't taken hold though. Jesus cross resurrection thing hasn't happened yet. The deal that we are under here in the Old Testament is a deal where God has said you are going to be a holy people uniquely set apart. And that specifically, I think the verse I'm referencing is Exodus 19. Why do I not write these things down? Hang on, just bear with me. If I don't know where it is, I don't know where it is, you need to know that I didn't know where it is. I was really sure this was Exodus 19. It is Exodus 19. There it is. And of verse five, although the whole earth is mine, verse six, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites. And then Moses is instructed to go down and relay what the deal is going to be between God and the Jewish people, the Hebrews, the Israelites who have just left slavery in Egypt and are on their way to their adventures in the desert and their eventual conquest and establishment in the Holy Land. So what we're going to break down with more specificity tomorrow is this deal between God and the people that Ezra believes the returning exiles are in breach of that Ezra believes the returning exiles are so, I should say, in breach of that they are about to make the equivalent, irreversible mistake of dumping Drano in their eyes. You just can't fix it. Ezra's looking at the situation is like all this intermarriage and consecrating this and institutionalizing these detestable practices into our own culture, even into our priestly system. Like we are in the process of doing irreparably right now, we can't fix that. We can't make that go away. If it gets roots down, we have to defeat it right now. And this is where Ezra's quest is really going to crystallize. But again, we have modern sensibilities and we're reading this through the lenses of those modern sensibilities, sensibilities I happen to like. And so I think we need to take a little more time to dip back into Exodus and understand better exactly what the terms of the deal are that Ezra is saying his people are in breach of nearly irreparably. And what the terms of the deal is that also Nehemiah is going to go and participate in protecting Nehemiah is going to rebuild a wall as there's going to rebuild a people. And so I think this is where we got to pause and jump back into that or else this is just going to feel weird. And we're going to have to feel weird about it. And like this is one of those places where the Old Testament as weird values, it doesn't fit how things are now and I have to apologize for that or just feel weird about it in my brain. Now I think this squares if we understand the unfolding of history and the unfolding of what's going on here in the Bible. So we'll just take a minute and do that next time around. I'm Matt this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
