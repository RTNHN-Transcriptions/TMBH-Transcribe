"transcription_data": {"text": " everybody it's Matt this is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we're working our way through the book of Esther one little bit at a time we're in Esther chapter five we're in this little interlude in the middle of really the big climactic moment here Esther has mustered the courage to go and approach King Xerxes uninvited we know that she needs to catch his ear and catch him on a good day to tell him hey well you know you issued an order well really your buddy Haman issued an order in your name to kill all the Jews and well weirdest thing I'm actually one of those and I was wondering if maybe you could not do that but if she catches him at the wrong moment and the king doesn't want to see her he might do something crazy like just execute her because you're not allowed to approach the king so she goes and she approaches the king and she invites him to a banquet and seems like things are going really well but it's a two part plan to try to get the king to listen and so after the first half of the plan we followed the bad guy out of the room Haman and he's really happy about how well he's been treated and getting to hang out with the king and the queen he doesn't know what's coming he doesn't know that she's Jew he doesn't know that she's trying to turn the tables on him but Haman goes out of there and high spirits he's happy about things and then he runs into Mordecai the Jew at the gate Mordecai won't honor Haman that makes Haman real mad so he goes home and he hangs out with his wife and his friends and yesterday we talked about the role that his wife a Lady Macbeth type character plays here she doesn't bring out the best things in Haman she doesn't try to talk him down she doesn't try to settle him down instead it's more like she's trying to amp him up to make him do even crazier things for her ambition or who knows why and we also talked yesterday about how her character doesn't just have echoes of Lady Macbeth of Shakespeare fame but she also is very reminiscent of Jezebel wife of the wicked king Ahab who really are the main bad guys of a big chunk of first kings and so she's got these Jezebel characteristics as well but she's not the only one at this party and doesn't it seem by the way like so much of Esther is just built around banquets and parties it's a very high society political high court thriller kind of story so here we are at another party Haman goes home and throws a party to celebrate having being invited to a party with his wife and his friends and he says all the things he blusters about how rich he is how many kids he has 10 of them 10 sons crazy and how high a position he has how much the king likes him and how much the queen likes him and all of this stuff but then he wraps up his celebratory remarks by I assume somewhat drunkenly saying but all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate that's verse 13 of Esther chapter 5 and now we run into this moment where his friends or his wife could be like okay but I mean think about all the stuff you just said man I think things are okay but they don't his wife dumps fuel on the fire his friends dump fuel on the fire and in the end this is going to prove to be providential they got uses their bad advice and they're poorly formed friendship support to to deliver his people and so it says in Esther 514 his wife's there ish and all his friends said to him so they are in agreement and this agreement is quick it's almost as though they've been thinking about this moment for a long time hoping to get to give whatever advice it is that they're about to give because they have been well aware of this situation where Mordecai the Jew won't show proper respect to Haman and it kind of comes off like they've conspired and this sort of an intervention but it needs to be his idea he needs to ask before we can really give this advice because they are so quick on the trigger with what Haman ought to do in response to being incredibly rich but having one single guy not bow to him so again his wife is there ish and all his friends said to him have a gallows built 75 feet high and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hang on it then go with the king to the dinner and be happy this suggestion delighted Haman and he had the gallows built now just in terms of the timeline here is pretty crazy right because it's a it's a two day banquet part one of the banquet is I mean let's just say it's a Monday I don't think we get days of the week in here probably this is pretended it's a Monday so Monday night we got our first banquet with Esther and the king Haman goes home after that to an after party with his friends that we're reading about here and that what evening that night he gets this advice from Zarish and his friends in response to his terrible suffering that's been inflicted by somebody not showing him honor one guy not showing him honor and he gets the advice to build a gallows now not a normal gallows like I don't know how tall does a gallows have to be to work just taller than whoever you're hanging right so maybe seven feet would get it done I've never hung anybody so I'm really not totally clear on that but I know it doesn't have to be 75 feet high now you're just making a point so that part of the advice is super presumptuous right I just make it gigantic and also the idea that it would be within his scope of power and authority to order something like this built that's pretty presumptuous but most presumptuous is how much Haman has given his wife and his friends the impression that the king is totally in his hip pocket because they think that he can just go to the king and be like hey uh just have the guy hanged just tell the king that you're going to do it because he annoyed you and the king I'll just go for it now they probably have some reason to think this because of how sloppy the king was in response to Haman's suggestion before that they should just go and kill all the Jews but also they should know that this king is volatile and that he's very worried about saving face and if you don't catch him in the right mood or at the right time he might not go along with this now Esther she seems to get that she seems to be more shrewd than Haman but Haman and his wife and his friends they're like well just I mean how hard is it just go to the most powerful person on earth and you just tell them what you're going to do and then he'll I'm sure like he'll just be great with that it'll be fine after all you will have already built the gallows well did they even think like what happens if you build these giant gallows and then you go to the king because that is the order of operations here and you're like hey I got to hang a guy it's weird you wouldn't stand for me I knew you'd be cool with it but I still thought just as a formality I would ask and then what if the king's like um no no I don't it's just not a hanging day man uh I'm not feeling it yet no we're not going to do it well then what do you do with your gallows that are just right there what story do you have to spin up to save face in front of everybody if the king would happen to say no it's also a really funny thing here because Haman and his wife and his friends are all like well the king is so manipulatable that all you got to do is just throw a suggestion at him and he'll do it they're all assuming that by the way and almost making a mockery of the authority of king Xerxes while they are simultaneously peppering Haman with advice and being like just build a gallows right now and just have him hung then Haman is just taking people's advice completely at face value and not even really gaming it out at all I mean how do we know he didn't game it out there's no time to game it out because party number one with Esther and Xerxes is on hypothetical Monday night then after party is where we are here and then right after this we're going to get party number two which theoretically is on Tuesday I'm gonna look really dumb if I'm forgetting some part where they specify what days of the week this happened I really don't think that's in there but that means that a 75 foot gallows got built overnight the Haman I suppose had to go wake up a bunch of craftsmen and be like hey I know you're doing your Monday night bedtime routine with the kiddos or whatever but we got to build a gallows it needs to be 75 feet high and probably they're like whoa we're probably hanging a lot of people then and then Haman has to be like no it's just one guy to satisfy my ego don't worry about it but obviously you'll need to go start on that right now because it has to be 75 feet high well could it be like seven and a half feet high no that doesn't quite make the point I want to make well could it be like next week no I wanted to be like tomorrow afternoon before dinner so I guess since I'm in charge I'm going to need you to do that right now and it looks as though and we'll see this as we move forward that the whole plan really gets carried out and like a night and just into the next morning because then a whole bunch of other stuff unfolds before we even get to banquet number two here and what we have here is another repetition of that theme of manipulation and influence ability and even though Haman isn't a king I mean he functions with almost the power of a king it's that also that clown king motif once again where Haman imagines he's this very powerful man who should not be disrespected but his silly goofball friends and his bloodthirsty wife just throw out an idea just off the cuff and then the guys mean to me cool build a gallows 75 feet high and just hang him tomorrow and then go to the banquet and Haman's like hmm I don't think I need to think that through at all let's just do it great he uncritically accepts this bit of advice with total credulity and just orders it built so he can get that off his plate and be done with it tomorrow not thinking at all about how big the spectacle is and like we were talking about how big the potential for backfire is here as well this theme of influence and resistance to influence and manipulation is hugely important in this book sometimes it's subtle sometimes it's really overt but it's all over the place here to contrast the insecurities and the weakness and the exploitability of even very powerful men and women with the absolutely unmanipulatability of God who is sovereign and in control over all things even when his name isn't being mentioned you can trick a guy like Xerxes into doing stupid things that aren't in his or anybody's best interest you can trick a stupid guy like Haman into doing things that aren't in his or anybody else's best interest but God is immune to that kind of stuff all right we got to talk a little bit more about these friends and the very interesting plot situation and new tension that this decision to build this galos introduces into the story next time around all right i'm matt this is a 10 minute bible hour podcast let's do this again soon you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0,
