I mean, it's like, what, early 90s, maybe mid 90s, something like that. It was a good show. I didn't get it at first. Took me a couple tries, but it's one of those movies that has everything making sense when you get to the end, but it doesn't make sense at the beginning. Other movies tried to capture this if you haven't seen The Usual Suspects, which I don't recommend it or any movies. I don't know. What was the other one? Memento with was Trinity in that? Carrying on moss? I think it was, wasn't it? Oh, wow. I haven't thought about that for a while. That was a pretty good show that tried to make sense of itself in reverse, but it couldn't match the magic of the Usual Suspects in terms of the reveal. And then the very popularized attempt at this kind of storytelling was the Sixth Sense, which, you know, I don't know, if you like The Sixth Sense, you like The Sixth Sense. The point being, there are three different movies that you've probably heard of with varying levels of quality and perfection in the execution that are all trying to do the thing where it doesn't make sense as you're going through it and you have all these loose ends flapping around, but then you get to the end and you're like, dang, it all fits together now. It works. Well, better than all of those is the Book of Matthew and its relationship with the Old Testament. It is unbelievable how good these payoffs are, both the overt ones and the sneaky little ones. Today, all I want to do is a quick roundup on all of the places where there is an overt illusion in the Book of Matthew to something that Jesus was fulfilling on one of those multiple levels that we talked about yesterday. I did not make this list. I mean, I guess I could make this list. I could have just been writing it down all the time. I don't know why I didn't do that, but really smart people did. And this is from a couple of different books that I have left over from school. And we were reading about this stuff and we had to take tests on it. So here we go. Ready? Matthew 123. This is the fulfillment of stuff from Isaiah seven and eight that talks about there being a virgin who will conceive then in Matthew two six. By the way, if right now you're like, Oh gosh, I normally like this program. Seriously, we're just going to go through a list like this. That's, that's what we're going to do today. Like I was hoping for more like fart jokes or candy cigarettes or maybe another story about somebody getting crushed in the family jewels by baseball or something fun like that. Like I'm telling you, yeah, this is going to be a little bit workman like here for the next five or six minutes or so. But it's one of those moments for you where if you've been listening to this, there's a payoff here because you did the work to appreciate those things. So you know, hey, let's savor this a little bit together, even as we move quickly. Matthew two six is a reference to Micah five. This is the idea that the Messiah is going to be from Bethlehem. Then Matthew two 15 is a reference to Jose 11 that God's son will be called out of Egypt. Matthew two 18 is a reference to Jeremiah 31. All the stuff in Jeremiah is super sad. Jeremiah is the wailing prophet in here. So we wailing for children who get killed. That's in the context of the Herod business. Matthew two 23 rather is a reference judges and Isaiah that Jesus will be called a Nazarene. That one was a little bit tricky and we had to kind of think through exactly how that fits. I still think that one is perhaps a touch ambiguous. Matthew three three is a reference to Isaiah 40 saying that John will be the voice of one calling in the wilderness. And Matthew four four points back to Deuteronomy eight three. That is Jesus during the temptation talking about living on more than bread alone for six. That's Jesus again, referencing back to the Psalms, talking about angels coming to protect him if he wants him, which there's fulfillment to that also in Jesus remarks in the garden that we've been looking at the last few days where he says, I could call down a legion of those if I want to. I don't want to because I want these scriptures to be fulfilled moving on. Matthew four seven is a reference back to Deuteronomy six. Again, this is in the temptation. Don't test God. Matthew four 10 again, defeating Satan's test a test that all humans ever have failed, but not Jesus because Jesus leans deeply into the authority and reliability of his father and his father's word. And again, he quotes Deuteronomy six saying that only God is supposed to be worshiped and then four 15 and 16. There's a reference to a turn of a phrase in Isaiah nine about Galilee. And then wow, the sermon on the Mount. There's so much. I'm not going to go through all of these specifically, but you've got those. I can never remember one, two, three, four, five, is it six statements in Matthew five? All of the you've heard it said that, but I tell you statements where Jesus is fleshing out the idea of fulfilling the law and what that means and what it looks like to have a righteous and sit exceeds even that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. Well, he references a bunch of stuff from Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and all of those references would just be to the original command or prohibition against bad behavior. And then after the sermon on the Mount Matthew eight, 17, that's a reference to Isaiah 53, the text that you and I looked at when we bounced over to Luke 22, the parallel passage about the Garden of Goodsemane where Jesus is saying like, no, he's got to be numbered against the transgressors. That caused us to go look at Isaiah 53. Isaiah 53 is what gets referenced in Matthew eight, 17 about he took our infirmities upon him. Matthew nine, 13 is a reference to Jose, a six that God desires mercy. Matthew 10 is a reference to Micah seven that there will be opponents to the kingdom, the good stuff that will come from within. And Matthew 11, 10 is a reference to Malachi three, one, there is a messenger that prepares the way. Matthew 12, seven again references back to Jose six, six with that same theme of God desiring mercy. Matthew 12 18 through 21 points us back to Isaiah 42 and the concept of that beloved servant, a thought that gets rounded out in that very important end of Isaiah 52 and into Isaiah 53 that we went all the way through the other day. Then Matthew 12 40 is a reference back to Jonah chapter one and the whole Jonah and the fishes belly three days, all of that stuff. The sign of Jonah Matthew 13 14 takes us back to Isaiah six hearing without understanding Matthew 13 35 takes us to Psalm 78 teaching in parables is what he's talking about there. Matthew 15 four points us back to some stuff in the penituke about the 10 commandments honoring your parents, Matthew 15 eight nine takes us back to Isaiah 29 that deals with hypocrisy and how people approach God and celebrate God worship. Then Matthew 18 16 is a direct illusion back to the rule of how many witnesses have to be present to accuse rightly someone to bear testimony. You 19 for and then 19 seven go back to back with a reference to Genesis just right to the beginning. God made the male and female and then a reference to the divorce things. This is the divorce and remarriage passage from Deuteronomy 24 that he's referencing. Then a little later on in Matthew 19 another reference to the 10 commandments don't murder then a fulfillment direct fulfillment reference in Matthew 21 five is he's coming to Jerusalem. That points back to Isaiah 62 Zechariah nine that talks about the king coming in on a donkey then just a few verses later Matthew 21 nine the stuff about the son of David and all of that business and the praise from children. Those are references to Psalm 118 and Psalm eight and then Isaiah 56 it gets called out in Matthew 21 when he cleanses the temple when he calls him a den of robbers Matthew 21 42 points again to Psalm 118 with this cornerstone language we went and revisited that passage a whole bunch as well. Matthew 22 24 points to Deuteronomy 25 five and kind of the cursedness of a man dying without children. Matthew 22 32 points us back to Exodus three to reference to the I am the God of Abraham and then 22 37 is the greatest commandment love the Lord your God with all your God. It's Deuteronomy six Matthew 22 39 points you back to Leviticus 19 the second part of the big commandment of your neighbors yourself. Matthew 22 44 takes us back to Psalm 110 this is when Jesus went back and pled with his Pharisee colleagues like hey please revisit this think about what is actually happening here and he goes back to that that famous passage about David talking to God and God saying I come sit at my right hand and I don't need to unpack all of that one again. Matthew 23 39 takes us back again to Psalm 118 that's the same chapter where we get the cornerstone language from earlier. Matthew 24 30 that Jesus directly alludes to this in Daniel chapter seven with the son of man appearing and then Matthew 26 31 this we looked at just a little bit ago it's a reference to Zechariah 13 that's the shepherd being struck and everybody scattering and then 26 64 which were not quite too yet is going to point us back to Psalm 110 and Daniel seven and the return of the son of man Matthew 27 9 through 10 is going to point us back again to Zechariah this will be the rounding out of something that we didn't totally cover when we were on Judas before but we'll pay it off there with the 30 pieces of silver references Zechariah 11 and some other places in the Old Testament there are really multiple levels of fulfillment there and then finally Matthew 27 46 references Psalm 22 and being abandoned by God. Now I know I know that was a ton of stuff. The point of this exercise was not for you to be like I got all of it. Yep that's the perfect learning pace for me and I feel like I have all of that in my hip pocket forever and ever and ever now. No all I wanted to do was just for once in our lives one time in this walkthrough put all of it on the table at once. So we could appreciate it in its grandeur how hard is it to pay all of that off and those are only the overt references my friends. I didn't even touch well other than a couple of quick nods as I was blitzing through that we didn't even touch all of the story fulfillment all of the narrative arc completion. This is just smoking gun stuff. The point is when they go to arrest Jesus Peter gets out of sword and is like we're going to kill our way out of this and Jesus is like we are not going to kill our way out of this. Those who live by the sword die by the sword. I could bring in a whole legion of angels if I wanted to and plus the scriptures are supposed to be fulfilled in this way when he says the scriptures are supposed to be fulfilled and then when he later says but this is all taken place at the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. He's not talking about one verse. That's my point. He's talking about like everything what scripture. I don't know. You remember the trailer for battleship with Liam Neeson and Rihanna where the guys like sir it's like aliens or something. What should we do? Ready the weapons and the guys like which one sir and then it shows Liam Neeson's face up real close and he's like all of them. I think you're supposed to feel something when that happened except here you actually feel something and I go dang that is all of them. It's like Jesus is the fulfillment not of one passage or this other passage or this one prophet or this one little story or anecdote or this one character. He's the fulfillment of everything. Everything points to him and he's not going to stumble at the finish line by letting his buddies go around and kill people to ruin the whole thing even though he'd obviously prefer not to be crucified. I know, no, no, he is going to finish strong. He's going to push this thing over the goal line and indeed all of these things some we just looked at in the list and so many more that are bigger and more abstract are going to be fulfilled in him. I just think it is so cool. I hope you had fun with this. If you didn't, thanks for being patient while we just reeled off a ton of Bible. We'll move forward tomorrow. I'm Matt.
