It's fast, fun, free, daily, deep-dye Bible, and right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy-to-use format at thetmbh.com. It's gonna feel like what I'm gonna do right now is just take a big giant mean swipe at the state of California, but I like California. I think it's cool. I've been there many, many times. And even though I think this example of government ineptitude on this one particular issue is worth noting, I still think California is real cool. I'm just not gonna say mean things about it. So there, I like your state. If you're from California, I think you live in a cool or really beautiful place with lots of interesting history. However, boy, that bullet train fiasco is quite the fiasco, isn't it? For like 20 years, there's this plan to build this super high-speed train like they do in Asia or maybe even parts of Europe. They were gonna put that connecting northern and southern California. They started throwing money at it. I mean, crazy money at it. And then something malfunctioned with whoever was in charge of that, whatever department in the government there was in charge, they fouled stuff up, things got expensive and red tapey, regulation kicked in and nothing happened. I don't think anything's happened. I don't think an inch of track has been put down on this massive project that already has a massive expenditure behind it. And I think the most recent news on this project, please correct me if I'm wrong, is that the French company who was gonna build this train finally just pulled out and said it's impossible. All right, we can build this anywhere else. We just can't build it here. It's not gonna work. We can't do this, which is no reflection on the humans of California in general, which is a lovely and beautiful place. But wow, that is an unfortunate look for that particular segment of the government and whatever it is that's gone wrong there. And I do think it's fair to say that that's kind of a metaphor for what happens when stuff becomes dysfunctional and broken and over middle managed in a decision making capacity when you're working on a project or when sometimes the government gets their hands on things and becomes wildly inefficient. Likewise, this wall project that we've been reading about in the 400s BC in Jerusalem that's described in the book of Nehemiah has the makings of the California bullet train kind of situation. So not because the people there are turds are awful and Jerusalem is a lovely place. I even think back in the day without walls, it was a lovely place. People would throw in the effort at it to rebuild it. Culture, I mean, they're getting their feet underneath them again. A lot of good things have happened in the time since the exiles have been back, but they're vulnerable. And a wall much like a train is a tricky project because nobody really owns it. And it interferes with or touches a lot of different people's personal property. It touches some commonly held governmentally owned property. How do you fund it? How do you make it work? You know, these things can be tricky and they can take a minute. I mean, you know, it goes better in the California bullet train thing, but you know, it's not easy is the point. And so you'd expect that maybe in most situations like this, a wall, a train, a great big road, you're going to run into a lot of headaches. If you do get it done, and hopefully generally you do get it done, it might not be as fast as a project on your own property because there's going to be division and infighting and people aren't going to have the same vision for things and so on and so forth. So it's kind of mind blowing when we get to the end of Nehemiah six and we discover that the wall was done. That's right. It's finished. Despite the fact that the most robust bureaucracy in history up until this moment in time is what was in place during the time of Nehemiah. And look, the project has not been without red tape, right? Look at all the stuff that Nehemiah has had to go through. He's had political opposition. He's been accused of sedition and treason. He's had people literally trying to just run onto the work site and I guess probably stab him. He's had people trying to lure him to the murder docks metaphorically out in the desert. Late at night, come alone. Don't bring the cops to presumably murder him again. All of that tension has contributed to an economic chaos that he's tried to solve. That was kind of a friendly fire situation. And then here most recently, he faces not a literal physical assassination attempt, but a political reputational assassination attempt. And it comes on two fronts from two people theoretically on his side. The son of Dellaia, tough name, the son of Mehtabel, tough name also. He got hired by Tobias and Gesham and Sandballat, the enemies of the whole project were trying to keep the wall from getting built. They hired one of Nehemiah's fellow countrymen to try to trick him into the effectively crying wolf and embarrassing himself and transgressing certain religious and cultural sensibilities that would destroy his reputation. Nehemiah sniffed it out. He didn't fall for it. And then in addition to that, apparently prophets were hired from within the ranks of the Jewish returning exiles to try to ruin Nehemiah as well in the Dune Benadgeserit witch fashion, try to seed false prophecy and false narratives religiously all around to undermine the project and cause the people to lose heart and lose faith in their leader. Somehow Nehemiah sniffed that out and he got through it as well. This guy's made of metal. He's got ice in his veins. He can do anything apparently. Apparently he can do anything because even if there was no opposition to accomplish any public works project at all, let alone one of this size in 52 days is mind boggling. But it's way harder when everybody's trying to kill you or wreck your reputation from every direction the entire time you're trying to get work done. He couldn't even use all of his workers to work the whole time because they had to do split shifts, wearing armor and carrying spears, just making sure nobody would break into the work site and start murdering people. This is as difficult a project as I can imagine in the ancient world and he got it done in 52 days. I haven't read you the verse yet. There's a verse says he got it done in 52 days verse 15 Nehemiah 6. So the wall was completed on the 25th of Elle in 52 days. Boom. The end is that amazing Nehemiah himself, the guy who's doing the project is writing this book. He could pump that up. He could make that so much more dramatic and betterify it. But instead it's like, okay, so anyways, that was the end of all of the assassination attempts and everybody trying to kill us and everything. You're probably wondering how the wall was going. Sure. Speak to that. We have we finished it. It was 52 days. Here's the day we finished it on. Anyways, and some other stuff happened. Wait, what you accomplished a public works project that encompasses the entire city in 52 days. And you did it by employing all the normal people and pulling them out of their shops and businesses and huffles and thatched roof cottages. And you roped them into this project and taught them how to build things while keeping them from getting murdered and overcoming bureaucratic red tape and attempts to stall this thing out and tie it up in court for decades on end. You did that in 52 days. And you gave us one sentence to commemorate it. I lived in a place one time where a road broke just broke. This is real pity. You couldn't really drive on anymore. It broke that bad. The road broke. They brought in somebody to fix the road. It's not a big chunk of road. It's a tiny little chunk of rope. It broke and we really needed that chunk of road. I mean, I had to have the chunk of road in order for things to work for a huge percentage of this community. For most of the time I lived in that place, that road was just broken. Couldn't get it done. It wasn't huge. I think you probably could have had a couple private companies rally together and go do it and be like, there, now the thing's done. That's it. Now that whole part of the community is open again and we can use it. But instead, it was years and years and years and years that that tiny chunk of road was broken and impassable. We still paid taxes the whole time. Don't get me wrong. They made sure to collect all of those. The most obvious thing everybody would want fixed was that tiny little chunk of road. I'm guessing every single one of you can think of something that you've sat there and looked at in your community for far longer than it should have taken to get that thing fixed. The Californians are not alone in their slow build and slow process though. I mean, the bullet train, I mean, that's kind of, that one was a lot. Nope. This is just the nature of these kinds of things sometimes. And when you think about those things in your community that have become a metaphor for what the heck are we doing here guys? How can something this simple take so long when you think about that? I think you and I will appreciate all the more what Nehemiah accomplished in 52 days with people who is not even probably their job to do the work while people were actively trying to murder him. I didn't see anybody actively trying to murder anybody who was involved in fixing that tiny little stretch of road in that community I used to live in. This is an amazing accomplishment whether you're talking about right now or 2,500 years ago and I am going to reach across the span of time and high five every single one of the people involved in making this thing go 52 days. You people rule. I admire you and I am taking notes. We got mop up duty on the end of chapter six tomorrow and then we're into seven after that which means we get the little arrested development thing we're doing at the beginning of every chapter. I've missed it. I'm excited to get a cooking again. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. Thank you. Have a great day. Have a great day.
