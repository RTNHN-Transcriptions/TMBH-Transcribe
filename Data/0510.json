Have you ever been like maybe you drink into things you're like alright we're going to solve this stuff. Alright Ted what would you say is like the principle how's it got to be and depending on what Ted thinks he's going to be like you know you just got to have people respect each other and then maybe things would work and everybody's like yeah that's pretty good. Kayla what do you got what do you do I what's your one thing for solving all the stuff maybe she takes a sip she's like you know I think if everybody could just learn to laugh a little bit more that would probably get things done you're like okay alright and then you got Ron sitting over there and you're like Ron what would be like the one thing that would solve it all and he'd like it's a non-aggression principle people just need to leave other people's property and their stuff alone and that'll work just fine. It's a fun exercise to try to boil everything down to one simple little mantra one simple little greatest thing and in a way that's a kind of conversation we've been looking at here in Matthew chapter 22 verses 34 through 40 where we have Glenn the expert in the law who comes up and he's not really wanting to play the whole screaming shrieking head argue about everything bickering game with Jesus it looks more like he just wants to ask an honest question like hmm you know what I think it's my job right now to pick a fight with this guy and put him to some kind of test to humiliate him in front of everybody but one I'm pretty sure I'm not capable of pulling that off and two you know what kind of like him to answer the question for me like the big question like what's the point what should I be doing if nothing else and like there's some pretty smart people I've read I mean like really smart experts in this kind of stuff I've read who've dug deep and they would make the case that maybe this was a burning question of the day and the different factions even within Phariseeism had different takes on what the greatest commandment was and so maybe the original audience it was like oh my goodness this really speaks to one of the hot button questions hot button issues of the day I don't know that I'm persuaded of that for that matter I don't even know if I'm smart enough to understand all the evidence they're put in front of me to be persuaded but that notion is out there among some quality people maybe Jesus is just answering this guy's individual question when he says teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law or maybe he's speaking to something even bigger than just this individual's question but whatever the case Jesus takes it at face value and he answers it thusly once again love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it love your neighbor is yourself all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments like we were talking about yesterday there's another one of those two hit combos from Jesus he's referencing his father and he's referencing the scripture and he's referencing some very specific very very famous scripture when he does this in Deuteronomy 6 5 it's odd like Deuteronomy is just not a part of my Bible that is particularly well worn it's very pristine it's clean there aren't all the wrinkles that I get over there in Matthew and it says this well I'm going to start in verse 4 because this oft quoted chunk of Bible that was called the Shema I think that's how they say it the Shema starts with Deuteronomy 6 4 and it goes like this hero Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength these commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts and press them on your children talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you get up tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads write them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates and maybe as I'm reading that for the first time some you're like oh oh that's why like Orthodox Jewish people do the little things with the little like rolled up bits of Bible and stuff they've been doing that for a long time my friend because they're taking this commandment of God this beautiful and crucial center cut old testament communication from God to people this passage they're taking it to heart very literally and in fact I think the oldest the literal chunk of written Bible that we have is one of these little rolled up scrolls I think it was on a piece of tin or silver and it was etched in ancient Hebrew which is legible to a Bible scholar today who just reads the normal Bible Hebrew and I'll roll up bit of scroll has the priestly blessing that's somewhere in the early going of numbers and I don't remember exactly how it goes was pretty close to this God bless you and keep you and have his face shine upon you and show you grace and lift up his countenance to you and give you peace as well that's the gist so anyways interesting side note but the point is this shamaw this statement right here is something everybody would have known everybody would have repeated this is like we the people this like the pledge of allegiance it's like the first verse of ice ice baby everybody knows all of it by heart this transcends culture and so when Jesus goes there it's pretty satisfying and pretty unifying for everybody who's here in this stuff so like yeah that's pretty good because I don't think anybody would have been like no it can't be that I mean this was probably the chief candidate in a lot of the listeners minds for what the number one command of God would be love God with everything you got but where it gets interesting is that Jesus adds to that Leviticus 1918 and interestingly Leviticus is even more pristine in my Bible than Deuteronomy is now you don't want the kiddos flipping through Leviticus unsupervised especially Leviticus 19 which gets a little goofy but 18 in particular yeah yeah yeah yeah it gets into some real juicy stuff there but Leviticus 1918 is what Jesus is referencing the first half of it is the teaching on revenge it says don't seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people which is reminiscent of all the stuff Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount in chapter five when he is expanding on all of the you've heard it said in the past but I tell you that fulfillment statements but then the rest of Leviticus 1918 goes like this but love your neighbor as yourself I am the Lord again to hit combo there's a scripture there's the authority of God that is Jesus style not a surprise that he's referencing this and then Jesus rounds out his thoughts saying all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments so it was like the whole thing is summed up in this if you get this right all the other busy work that you guys over there the Sadducees and you guys over here the Pharisees and you guys over there the other religious group of seas or those group of seas all you fight about all of this stuff but if you ran everything through that interpretive filter you'd be on track what he's in toning I think somewhat subtly here is that you're not on track because you don't think these two things are the greatest commandments there are two little subtleties here that I also really appreciate one is that this is a harkening back to what he just brought up to anecdotes earlier about us being the image bearers of God God is obviously the biggest deal in this whole equation loving God is the most important thing that you can do but since other people are made in the image of God it only makes sense that if you love God truly love God you would love what he loves and you would love what bears his image again implicitly Jesus seems to be suggesting that the people right here who are testing him and getting after him do not get those things right that they do not love others who are made in the image of God and maybe that implicit critique landed for a few of these folks maybe it didn't but I do think it's in there the other thing that I think is subtle but is also very present is that by joining together Deuteronomy 6 5 and Leviticus 1918 Jesus is following through on a teaching that he introduced in his first big public speech which is the Sermon on the Mount once again remember this theme that comes up there that comes up like all through Matthew it's the one about if you've been given something by God you have to give it away do you remember in that oath of fealty that Lord's prayer that bending the knee prayer to God what's the one thing that the prayer says that they are going to do because the whole prayer is all about what we're asking God to do but there's one part in there where the person praying it is like hey I'm going to do this forgive us our deaths as we also have forgiven our debtors and then the stuff that comes right after the sign up prayer the oath of loyalty to God the bend the knee assume the right posture enter into the kingdom by the righteous work of God prayer the thing that comes very next is you got to give away what you've received for if you forgive men when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you don't forgive them in their sins your father will not forgive your sins and then this theme keeps repeating if you have been given sustenance provision grace patience love by God the father through no merit or hard work of your own then you have to give that stuff away to your peers who are in need then obviously speaking of the sermon on the mount there's a pretty clear illusion to chapter seven as well where the golden rule happens which sounds a lot like Leviticus 19 18 that idea of doing others as you would have them do it to you it's it's right there those are the values of the kingdom and so it makes perfect sense that Jesus would round out this half of the greatest commandment in Deuteronomy six five that so many in the original audience would have embraced with this second half in Leviticus 19 18 where he's effectively saying once again you've been given existence by God you give loyalty to God but that love that exists from God and toward God must also be given away to other people who are also made in the image of God presumably even when it's difficult just like everyone of us has sat around had a conversation with our friends where at some point we get into the deep water and try to bottom line it like what if we could just all get this one thing right and that would solve all things what would that one thing be so it is somebody comes to Jesus and asks him exactly that question like if we got to get one thing right what's the biggest one and Jesus says love God with everything you got and then love other people as yourself seems clear enough we'll leave it at that I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do
