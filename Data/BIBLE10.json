Right now, we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about second Samuel. Hey everybody, it's Matt, and right up the top to any dancer question that a lot of you have been asking me, and that is, who's a lady with the pretty voice at the beginning of the thing? And says stuff about this 10 Minute Bible Hour going to do the thing. Is that your wife? Yep, that's my wife. That's Camilla. She did that, and I do think she has a lovely voice, and I'm super grateful that she would grace my podcast with it. So I thought that was awesome. Thanks for asking about it. Last time around, we finished the mid-season finale of this dramatic series that, you know, in the Bible, they call first and second Samuel, but that really is just one season. It's just one book. It's just Samuel, but it had to get split in two. And as we discussed yesterday, they split it at a really good place, pacing wise, because we come away with all of these questions. What's going to happen now that Saul, the first king of Israel, who looked pretty good at first and then totally went off the rails and his insecurity and his anger and his temper and his rage. Now that he's dead by sort of his own hand, what do you call it when somebody falls on their own sword? By his own sword, now that he's dead, what's going to happen is what's left of his household going to grab the throne? That would be problematic because Samuel, the other big character in this book, he anointed David, God picked David, and David has done pretty much everything right in first Samuel. It seems like he's the rightful king, but they're going to be people who are loyal to Saul, who are not going to want that. So what's going to happen in second Samuel? What's going to happen in the dramatic second half and final conclusion of this metaphorical premium television season here that we're calling first and second Samuel? The answer to that question is going to determine so much about where history is about to go coming out of this story. Well, as we suspected, there is immediately resistance to the idea of David becoming king because we're talking about the Bible or any other time in history, those vacuums in power, they don't just sit there and almost never. Does everybody see a scramble for power and then the guy in charge is dead and was like, guys, be calm. I know lots of people have legitimate claims they feel to the throne, but let's just go with that guy. That would be right. It's not usually what you get there exceptions, but this is not going to be one. Saul's household and Saul's allies, they are going to rally around their people to try to keep the throne in some sort of dynasty. It's going to take a little cobbling together in the name of Saul and they're going to resist David. And so very quickly, these sides start to take shape. But even as a civil war is looming and it's pretty obvious this is going to happen in chapter one, David's first response is not to go and gear up for war. His first response is to grieve the death of Saul and David uses one of his superpowers, which is the composition of verse, poetry, music to write this beautiful lament in memory and out of respect for Saul. And that's at the end of second Samuel chapter one. If you're only going to read a few things from this book, that would be my second biggest recommendation. If you're only going to read one thing from this book, we're going to get to what that is in just a minute. Well, those good vibes are over pretty quickly, not that David just becomes a bloodthirsty jerk. But after that, he looks to God and he's like, all right, well, where should I go next? What do I do? Because it's a wide open road. You don't have a really a throne anywhere. You don't have the tribes of Israel really rallied fully around anyone. It looks like one of those deals where somebody's probably just going to stick a crown on somebody's head. And we'll just see if maybe people follow them. That's an age old technique that persists to this day to deciding controversial successions of power. Well, even though when you think about the lineage of kings in what's called the unified kingdom of Israel here in the early days of the kingdom, you usually think, oh, Saul went first and then David, but there was a guy in between who kind of counts as king, even though he didn't have the support of everyone. And his name is Ish Busheth and he is the son of Saul. He's a 40 year old dude and he's going to make this claim with Abner, the guy who's the military leader in her Saul propping him up. Well, in the early going, it looks like Abner, who represents how Saul is going to try to work out some kind of trial by champions deal with Joab, who is the sworn sword of house David. And they get out like 20 champions, think Knights. And they're like, all right, we're just going to have them all fight, see what happens. And the description of the battle is really sad. It's like they all just grabbed each other with the one hand and then with their stab in hand, they all stabbed each other in the side. And pretty much everybody died. And it seems like this is a metaphor for how foolish and escalating and unnecessary all of this is. And it's kind of a throwback to that stuff that Samuel was saying when he was still alive in first Samuel, about like, sure, you all want a king because it's going to get ugly. If we do the king thing and they're like, yeah, we totally want the king. Okie dokie. Here you go. You get a king now. Well, this is the aftermath of that war is ugly. And that is exactly what we get in the ensuing chapters of second Samuel. There's murder. There's violence. There's lack of mercy. Eventually long story short, David wins and he manages to unify all of the different tribes. Ishbeshath is dead and out of the picture. Abner eventually dies. He's out of the picture. And once David has restored some kind of sanity to the situation and everybody is finally at least somewhat unified and in healing mode again, he decides that Jerusalem is going to be the city that he governs from. Despite all the conquering and all that everything else has been going on here, there are still Jebusites who occupy Jerusalem. And so David has to go and take Jerusalem in order to govern from there. He does. He names the city Zion and David brings the Ark of the Covenant, the presence of God. As you recall, the Israelites have the Ark back and now the Ark is moving to Jerusalem. And once it's there, David's like, all right, God, I think that what we need to do is build you a house, not a tent, but a permanent place to dwell among your people. And in maybe the most important passage in the entire Old Testament, it's top five, maybe in the whole Bible. Second Samuel chapter seven, go read this thing. We get a promise from God, a covenant from God. We haven't seen one of these for a while, right? That is made between him and David. Now we get the covenant between God and Abraham. I'm going to make you a people. You're going to have this land. You're going to be blessed and the nations are going to be blessed through you. Interesting that we get the covenant with Moses. That one's a lot more conditional. I'm going to be your God. You're going to be my people. All the nations are going to know that's the case because if you bless me, I'm going to bless you. And if you disobey me, I'm going to punish you. Well, now this Davidic promise is another unconditional one like the deal with Abraham. God's like, no, I'm going to have one of your offspring build me a house and that's going to be awesome. Thank you for offering. What we're going to do instead is I'm going to build something for you. And it's an eternal throne, an eternal kingdom with a great king who will one day come from your line and sit on this throne. Now, look, if you've been paying attention to what's been going on through all these books we've looked at so far, the sounds like a through line all the way back to that initial promise that God oddly makes to the snake. He tells the serpent, somebody's going to come along. You're going to strike at his heel, but he's going to crush your head. Amalamatic of the destruction of the curse that the serpent helped to initiate in the garden and that God is going about redeeming. We figured out that that character is going to come out of the line of Abraham and then we started to get some hints at that redeemer, that snake crusher, that defeater of the curse was going to come out of the descendant of Abraham named Judah, despite all of Judah's weird flaws. And Ruth, the previous book, at least tonally, gave us a pretty big hint that that redeemer was going to come out of the line of Ruth and Boaz. And indeed, now we're seeing that is going to be the case. There's language in this interaction between God and David that is about this eternal Messiah and this eternal throne. There's also language in here about Solomon and what's going to happen next. So you got to read it carefully, but it's there. I mean, it's all over it. Check out 2 Samuel 7. Well, now things are just going great. For the most part, David's made pretty good decisions, maybe a little erratic or inexplicable here or there, but he's a man after God's own heart. And he's still a man after God's own heart after what happens next, but it's a tough run for him and the people who he mistreats, including a woman named Bathsheba. Caesar bathing on the roof, he lusts for her. The king gets what the king wants. She becomes pregnant. And then David doubles down on his mistake by using some shoddy military tactics to make sure her very loyal, faithful husband, Uriah, is killed in battle. What God through his prophet calls David on this. David to his credit immediately repents. I mean, what else can you do at this point, but just own the mistake. And David has to endure painful consequences for what went wrong, including painful consequences within his own household as his kids and his extended family start to do really stupid, destructive things. David's son, Amnon, falls in love with his step sister and takes advantage of her. I'm using euphemisms. I understand that what he did was worse than takes advantage of. And then Tamar's full brother, Absalom, understandably once revenge. And so he orchestrates the murder of Amnon. That's kind of a family incident at this point. And somehow that just opens Pandora's box and now Absalom goes into full on revolt and tries to overthrow and displace his father, David. And in this ugly heartbreaking turn of events, David has to flee again. He's on the run. Surely he thought those days were behind him. David struggles to mount a defense against his own son. Absalom manages to take control of Jerusalem and govern from there. But then Absalom, who must have had amazing hair, is killed in a very memorable scene in 2 Samuel 18 when he's riding a donkey. But he rides it under some branches, like something out of the dukes, a hazard, instead of just getting knocked off his mule, his hair gets stuck in there. And that of course leaves him as a sitting duck for David's men and they kill him. Then through an ugly, drawn out, violent, up and down process, David is ultimately reestablished as king and reigns out through the rest of his days and is even able to pass on the throne to his son Solomon, who we're going to talk about more later on. But in all of that, we get kind of an odd season finale between chapters 21 and 24 of 2 Samuel, because we get a bunch of details here that seem to be out of order in terms of the timeline. It seems like what the author of Samuel is going for here is to communicate the mixed baggiveness of this whole affair with David. It's the Lord's anointed. He's a man after God's own heart. Every time he deviated from what God wanted him to do, he made absolute messes. And so what we see is both the beauty and the tragedy in the anecdotes included in these last few chapters. We see again David's artistry on display and his heart for the Lord. And then the final anecdote is David falling into a place of sin once again where he counts on his own strength by taking a census. God didn't want him to take and then realizes he was wrong and humbles himself before God again, but not until a very significant punishment has been leveled against all of Israel. What we see coming out of the dramatic premium TV style season that is first and second Samuel is a clear promise that God is still in on the redemptive plan and an unconditional promise that no matter how much David messes things up, God is going to establish this eternal kingdom with this eternal king who's going to reign forever and descend from David. So we come away feeling the frailty of humanity and the inability of humanity to get things right on their own. We come away with an answer to our question. Will kings solve everything coming out of the air of the judges? Nope, they will not. But we can take hope in that God has promised that one day there will be a king and that king is going to straighten things out. We're all curious about when that king is going to show up and what it's going to look like and we'll move forward in the story more on that in First Kings next time around. I'm Matt.
