This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and today is a very special episode because it's an onboarding episode. It's a reset episode. So if this is your first time ever here, hey, welcome. Thank you for hanging out with me and doing this stuff. You've been with me forever. I think you're going to benefit from this helpful reset as well. But whoever you are and whatever brings you here, hopefully we're all going for the same thing, which is to understand a book of the Bible really, really, really well together and to have fun doing it, even if we don't end up thinking about it the exact same way or coming to all of the same conclusions. Coming up on 400 episodes worth of conversations, we've been inching our way through the book of Matthew. We just got to the end of chapter 16. And before we roll into chapter 17, I thought we should do this to get everybody on the same page and caught up to speed and refreshed so that we can move together into the next stuff as an internet team. I've commissioned my friend Jeff to grace us with some special reset episode intro music. Jeff, go! Alright, this is going to be a lot. Stuff we know about Matthew. He was one of the disciples of Jesus. He was a tax collector who was a sellout to his own Jewish people in order to make money in helping to oppress his own people, the Jewish people. And so he would not have been a very popular guy or a well liked guy, but he was pretty handy with a pen and he put a whole lot of thought into how this book was going to be structured. And he structures the book of Matthew around five big speeches of Jesus, three of which we have looked at so far, the first of which is the Sermon on the Mount, chapters 5 through 7, the second of which is the Missional Discourse where Jesus sends out his disciples for the first time on a great big open world quest to go tell other people about him, message chapter 10, and then in chapter 13 we get the Kingdom Parables Discourse where Jesus tempers expectations about how the kingdom is going to unfold and explains what this thing is going to look like to a curious audience. We haven't got to the fourth and fifth speeches yet, but we'll get there eventually. So as members of the original audience would have picked up the book of Matthew and taken a look at chapter 1, these would have been people who would have seen their people group, the Jewish people kicked around like a soccer ball by half a dozen different conquerors that came and went over the previous several hundred years. There would have been vague, almost living memory, one generation removed memory of them having their own independent state under the leadership of the Maccabees family, the Hasmonean or Hasmonean dynasty that had been toppled by the Romans, then gradually the Romans had tightened their grip on these people and they would have been coming from probably one of two positions in terms of their attitude as they picked up the book of Matthew toward the Romans. Position number one would be we just need to roll with this. We can't take any more abuse. Let's just work with these people and do our best while still trying to be our people and remember our heritage. Other people would have been like, look, we got to act like we're getting along, but secretly we need to make these people go away and we need to be working on plans for how to do that politically or militarily and all of them would have had some notion of the idea that God had worked with their people in the past through the centuries, even the millennium and they would have believed that there was a series of promises in the Old Testament that were still due them from God, that God had made a deal with David, the greatest king ever in their history and that that deal with David was an unconditional promise to say there's going to be a great throne with a great king who sits on this throne and it's going to last forever and he's going to be descended from David. And this is where we start to see the more specific elements of the notion of Messiah that everybody was looking for at this point. After the independent states made up of the Jewish people's ancestors were defeated in the eighth century and sixth centuries BC, there's a whole bunch of difficult time that goes on, but there's also this promise from the prophet saying, there's something still to come and it's going to be great and they keep pointing to this redemption of God that is going to come through this Messiah figure. So as they pick up the document, the first thing they read in chapter one is a record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ to the son of David, the son of Abraham and then a massive list of names through the rest of chapter one or almost the rest of chapter one, each of whom would have had a story attached. There are Gentiles in there, there are men in there, there are women in there, there are heroes in there, there are dumpster fires in there, and all of it adds up to Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus, who is called the Christ. And then Matthew uses the title the Christ again in verse 17 and again in verse 18. He is not being at all subtle about what his thesis is here as he gives it the prologue in the background story about who Jesus is. He's saying like, this guy is the long awaited Messiah and he knew for a while that people were going to pick up the book and bring with them their assumptions and read into that different stuff. But Matthew is bringing them along bit by bit without answering that question of exactly what this Messiah is going to look like in the early going. We get into chapter two and Herod the great, the insane king appointed by the Romans is threatened by the prophecies surrounding Jesus. He decides that he wants to kill some babies to try to weed out this promised foreseen king who was maybe coming and might be born in Bethlehem. Joseph is warned in a dream and they retreat to Egypt where they hang out until Herod the great dies. Then after he dies at the end of chapter two, Joseph married Jesus go back to Nazareth where Jesus does a whole lot of growing up. Then we skip a ton of time between the end of two and the beginning of chapter three. And now we're meeting this new character, John the Baptist and it looks like he's the fulfillment of some stuff that was predicted in the book of Isaiah that all points toward the Messiah and he confronts some people out in the desert. There's this big religious upheaval and movement that is all centered around John the Baptist, but he keeps saying, no, it was the bigger deal. There's a more significant character coming. And then Jesus shows up and he's like, well, that's, that's the character. There's the one right there. And then he baptizes Jesus, God the father and the Holy Spirit show up. And chapter three ends with a voice from heaven saying, this is my son who my love with him, I am well pleased. And then we turn the page into chapter four and that same Holy Spirit goes from the baptism to leading Jesus out into the desert to be tempted by Satan. And Jesus passes the test of sin that everybody else for all of time has failed. And so now readers of this book are starting to get excited because they're like, well, I mean, that's one of the things that has to happen in order to be the Messiah. And then Jesus comes back and he hears that John has been arrested. So now John is moving out of the center stage and Jesus is moving into the middle of it. He recruits some guys and goes around repeating John's message, repent for the kingdom of heaven is near and his disciples sign up. And then in chapter five, he takes them up on a hillside like his mountainside, sermon on the Mount and he teaches them and he opens with the beatitudes describing the upside down values of the kingdom of God and how that's different from the values of the kingdom of the world and he explains what all of these values look like played out in issues of obedience and sin. And he points out like, nobody's really actually that good. Nobody is righteous enough to enter the kingdom of heaven. And then he goes on to unpack what it looks like to use a kingdom values mindset to do religious things like prayer and fasting. And we get to the centerpiece of the sermon on the Mount, which is effectively a prayer of conversion, which reads a lot like an oath of fealty that somebody would take to a king of your where they say, all right, well, I depend on you for everything. I want your kingdom to thrive. I know that you provide justice. You provide provisions for my physical well being and you protect us from evil. I will be forgiving and gracious as I know you to be forgiving and gracious to me. And then Jesus goes on to saying you got to forgive other people if you want God to forgive you. And then he rounds out the sermon on the Mount talking about how this kingdom value mindset changes the way you look at the world and even your individual needs. And then it ends with this warning to be like, all right, so where are you going to plant your feet on things that make sense or on things that are fading away and dangerous? Everybody's impressed because he teaches with authority sounds different than what everybody else was saying, but he's still very famous at this point. So some dude who's on a hot streak, but as we get into chapters eight and nine, he does all kinds of miraculous things in front of all kinds of people on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee primarily. And his fame is amping up rapidly. Even when he tells people, you don't go tell anybody what I just did for you. They can't help it. Like he heals some blind guys. He's like, well, don't tell anybody, but people are going to figure out real quick when they throw balls at those guys heads and all of a sudden they can catch it. Hey, you're not blind anymore. What happened out of that? Normally when you're blind, you just keep on be a blind forever because it's how blindness is. And at that point, you know, what are they going to do? Lie. So it says that, you know, they went out and they spread the word and news about Jesus spread all over that region. But now we see the Pharisees, the religious leaders of the day, the religious establishment, they don't like it. They find it threatening and they start thinking like, well, maybe it's like some power from the dark Lord that enables him to do this. I mean, we can't argue that miracles are happening, but surely that's not from God because we're kind of the gatekeepers of God and we didn't let this guy through. So even as all that tension is ratcheting up, Jesus looks at the crowds and he's like, I care about these people. I feel compassion, even though a lot of them don't like me and things are a mess and they're mad and he pulls his disciples aside and he's like, Hey, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. You can ask the Lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers and do his harvest field. And the idea here is like, okay, you guys now are kind of understanding what we're going for here. Like, if you would get to a place where you think it makes sense to pray for God to send people out into the harvest field, then you're sort of the answer to your prayer. So you should go do something. And indeed, that's what happens in the very next chapter, chapter 10. We get the list of the name of all of the disciples and then Jesus sends them out and he's like, all right, it's dangerous to go alone. Take this and he equips them with the message, which is the same one that was saying all along, same one that John the Baptist said, the kingdom of heaven is near. And he also gives him the ability to imitate some of his miraculous stuff. And then he gives him this long speech about here's how this little trip is going to go. Here's how the rest of your lives is going to go. And then just telling everybody, here's how it's going to go forever for people who represent me in this way. Well, a little bit after that, the disciples come back from their big open world trip. We get into chapter 11. John the Baptist disciples are like, Jesus looks pretty credible, but it's hard to say for sure who the actual Messiah is. So they're like, are you the one we should be expecting? And Jesus is like, well, go back and tell John who's in prison, John the Baptist, tell him this stuff, the blind received sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf here, the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor. So his answer is more or less like, if you go back and look at Isaiah 35, a prophet, you all know, this is all the stuff that's supposed to be happening when the actual Messiah is here as opposed to fake Messiah's. And then it looks like, you know, they leave happy with that answer, but the crowds are like, those guys are idiots. They should know better than that. And Jesus was rather impiling on John the Baptist disciples and said, turns on the crowd a little bit. He's like, Hey, you know, this generation has got some problems too. And this generation has some issues with seeing amazing miraculous things and still not really understanding the moment that is right in front of you. And then he looks to heaven and he says, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you've hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children. And so in this one remark, we see a big theological truth that the opening and shutting of eyes seems to be under the purview of God and that further, not everybody apparently is going to get it, even though it seems like all of this is very evident. Well, he wraps up chapter 11 with this general invitation to everybody again. He's like, Hey, come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, like the sheep work or harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. And I will give you rest, take my yoke upon you and learn from me because I'm gentle and humble of heart and you will find rest for your souls. Well, right after that beautiful thing, we get back into more ratcheting tension and ick stuff. We had a couple of controversies, one about eating food in a field on a Sabbath day and the other about healing a guy's wilted withered arm on a Sabbath day and the religious leaders, they do not like it. And they get real grouchy and combative about the thing. And this results with another very tense verbal showdown with Jesus, where the Pharisees come out looking really, really bad. And Jesus comes out looking very, very determined and also very not afraid of the spirit of the age, the tone of this moment in history, nor is he afraid of the religious leaders, even though they really do wield great power and they do have the capacity to get people riled up and get them killed. Then in chapter 13, Jesus has a bunch of people gather around him at a lakeside and there's so many as to get on a boat and go and teach them from out on the water. And he reels off a bunch of parables about the nature of the kingdom. And all of these parables frame up how this thing is going to unfold. Surely, there were some people there who were like, well, this is true. I guess everybody's going to sign up. And Jesus is like, no, it's not exactly how it's going to work. And other people were like, well, how are we going to sort this whole thing out? And Jesus has another parable ready that addresses that question saying it's not really yours to fix the kingdom and the world and to sort all of that out and to judge everybody that the world is being tended. And that ultimately the judgment of God will come around and all of that stuff that you might want to sort out yourself will get sorted out for you by God. Shortly after this, Jesus gets rejected by a bunch of town people who were familiar with him. We grew up around and there's like, you offend us, which is the laziest and most boring of all human emotional activities. And Jesus moves on from there and about the same time, John the Baptist, who we remember is Jesus hype man from early on. He has been crossways with one of the Herod family who doesn't like that John was calling him out for some of his weird incest, multi marriage nonsense that he'd been pulling. And there's some kind of sexy beer party that he throws. And there's a dance that makes him happy and he makes a rash promise to give the dancer girl whatever she wants and the dancer girl at the urging of her bomb is like, yeah, I watch on the Baptist head on a platter. So Herod to save face does it even though that's really a ruinous decision for his political fortunes. And Jesus is obviously sad about that because of his cousin and his heading and violent grizzly. So he goes to get away, but the crowds have Jesus fever and they can't get enough. So they follow him and he's out on the water trying to get away and they catch up with him. And they get a gigantic crowd of like 5000 men, let alone women and children as hung out with Jesus because he has compassion on them again, but they didn't bring food. They didn't plan on a long trip. And so you get the feeding of the 5000 miraculously everybody gets fed. Now Jesus is going to get away. He goes up to pray, sends the disciples out on the lake. The wind kicks up late at night and Jesus goes out there walks on the water. Peter comes out and joins him for a minute. Peter starts to sink. It's very demonstrative of how Peter is becoming our point of view character at this point. In the book, he's hot, he's cold, he's in, he's out, he's up, he's down and he's brash and he's bold. And there's something really likable and admirable about Peter, but there's also something really volatile about Peter. Whatever the case, Jesus pulls him out of the water and they finish making the trip. And in chapter 15, they're back into decidedly Jewish territory where some of the religious leaders from the big city of Jerusalem have come up north and they have more confrontations about the disciples lack of hand washing and wow, do sparks fly between Jesus and the Pharisees with Jesus coming out again, looking right and sharp and the Pharisees looking slack jawed and stunned. And then Jesus again gets out of dodge. He's like, I need to go and invest in these inner circle of disciples. So they had way up north along the way. They meet this Canaanite woman and she's begging for Jesus help in healing her afflicted daughter. And Jesus, I believe quotes a line that everybody would have known, one that was commonly used when he says it's not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs. He says that to the lady and the lady replies to a yell or but even the dogs, he comes from the master's table and Jesus is like, woman, you have great faith. Your request is granted. I think he intended to make this healing happen all along. He does so. He comes back down to the east side of the Sea of Galilee into a region called the Decapolis that is overwhelmingly Gentile in nature. And the same thing happens. It just happened a little bit ago. Big crowd gathers around. They sit down. They don't have food. And Jesus gives them fish and bread as well, thus completing the arc in terms of his relationship with outsiders or the Gentiles that we see set forward just a minute ago in the exchange with the Canaanite woman. It's not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs. And then he turns around and takes the children's bread and tosses it to what many would have considered to be dogs, outsiders, Gentiles. But in the eyes of Jesus, these are people made in the image of God, people on whom he has compassion and for whom everything he's doing is also applied. And so the four thousand men and then also women and children eat there. Jesus then gets back on the boat, sails back across the Sea of Galilee into decidedly Jewish territory and is immediately met with resistance again from the same religious leaders from two very differing parties who've created an unholy alliance to oppose him. He just can't go anywhere in Jewish territory by the time we get to 16 without being accosted by the people who are trying to figure out how to get rid of him. So he has a spicier yet exchange with them and then warns his disciples to be on their guard against the teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The disciples are starting to get it. Jesus takes off again and goes up north and away from the hubbub of Jewish territory and up there near a town called Caesarea Philippi. Jesus is sitting around maybe around a campfire or something. He's like, hey, guys, who do the people say the son of man is? Son of man is a term he used for himself. It's rooted in Daniel and some other parts of the Old Testament. And they replied, well, you know, John the Baptist, some other people say Elijah, other people say Jeremiah or one of the prophets. And Jesus is like, yeah, what about you? Who do you say I am? And Simon Peter says, you're the Christ, the son of the living God. And Jesus says, blessed are you. And then assigns a whole bunch of blessings to Peter and what's going to come out of that confession that he just made. And Jesus starts telling the disciples like, hey, I'm going to go to Jerusalem. I'm going to die soon. And Peter's like, that'll never happen. Not on my watch. And Jesus turns to him and says, get behind me Satan. You're a stumbling block to me. And then he turns to his disciples and more or less says, hey, this is going to cost you. If anybody wants to come after me, he's going to have to deny himself and take up his cross and then Jesus lists three reasons that that makes sense. And then at the end, he says, I tell you the truth, some of you are standing here will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom or coming in glory. And that sets us up for what we're going to look at as we move forward in chapter 17. So clearly, Matthew set out to make the case to a largely Jewish audience that this is their Messiah. Jesus is the guy. He's doing so very deftly and narratively. We're going from this pristine, beautiful, happy story where people are sick and hurting, get better. And there's this new people, this new family of faith being gathered to Jesus to a story that is increasingly sullied by violent intent and ugly exchanges and accusations. And Jesus goes and does things that are good and it's not met with goodwill. And it feels by the time we get into the beginning of 17, like it's Jesus and these disciples against a whole big percentage of the world. And like this thing really is headed toward a violent, ugly conclusion. But yet there is this sense of lingering hope and that the redemptive plan is not being thwarted in any of this, which sets up a really interesting home stretch over the next 12 chapters we're going to look at together. Last thing on the way out the door here. If you've been listening to this for a while and you like it, the biggest compliment that you could pay me would be to invite somebody else to be a part of this thing. I make episodes like this from time to time to make it easy for people to jump on. If they want to go back and get the back catalog they can, I would be honored if you would consider somebody who you like hanging out with, who you might be able to invite to listen to this and to shoot the breeze with you about it as you process it through together. Thanks for considering that. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
