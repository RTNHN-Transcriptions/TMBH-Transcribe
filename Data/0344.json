There was a game on there. The price is right. It's like a price naming game that was especially popular when I was a kid and I'd watch it when I was home sick from school. It has a whole bunch of different little sub games in it. You never know which games you're going to get on a given day, but there was one that I loved because of the psychological aspect of it. It was called one away. I don't know if they still do this or not. In one away, you'd eat it with the blue hair from Pasadena who comes up there and they're like, you could win a new car and they show her this car and she's all excited. Then they put up a price for the car that is wrong. Every digit of the price is wrong. But and this is where you get the name of the game, every digit in the price is one number away from being correct. And so then eat it with the blue hair from Pasadena goes through and she changes the first number up, second number down, third number up, fourth number up, the fifth number down and then Bob would be like, all right, well does she have one number right? You know, ding, ding, ding. Hey, this is great. Does she have two numbers right? Ding, ding, ding, ding. I was, I don't know what a car is. She have three numbers right. Ding, ding, ding, I'm going to jump around and start my osteoporosis. I'm going to break something. It's amazing. Because she have four numbers right. Oh, so now the crowd lets out this collective gasp of despair and Edith has to go back to the board, but they don't tell her which two numbers she has wrong. And that's where the genius of the game starts because your brain then starts working against yourself. So now Edith has to do this serious soul searching to figure out, God, am I confident in that answer or in that answer? I don't want to mess up the stuff I already got right trying to win this car. Which ones did I get wrong? I'm going to change those two. Well now she's only got one number right. Oh, no, she got everything wrong. There's this process of elimination to try to get it right. And eventually a lot of people would lose at this game because they weren't sure what they were getting right before. And therefore they didn't stick with what they were getting right. And they couldn't identify what they were getting wrong before. So they couldn't correct it. Again, it was a really fascinating metaphor for life and growth and how we screw things up and the ways that sometimes we dig the hole deeper trying to make it right. Sometimes we claw out of the hole. Well much like one away on the prices right, the religious leaders who are confronting Jesus in Matthew chapter 15 are playing this multi generational, multi centurial theological game of one away. They know that they screwed something up back in the day. The people of Israel, they had a deal with God. God made it with Moses and the deal was, I'm going to be your God. You're going to be my people and everybody's going to know that this is true because if you obey me, I'm going to bless you. And if you disobey me, I'm going to punish you either way. Everybody's going to know that I'm the one true God and that is the real point of the equation. Well, they get their own kingdom, the distant parts of the Old Testament, but then they don't really obey God that much and God follows through on his covenant and these other nations come in and they conquer the northern kingdom of Israel, the southern kingdom of Israel. And eventually there's no kingdom left at all. The temple where God lives and people commune with him and do sacrifices, it gets wrecked by Nebuchadnezzar. Everybody's hauled away in captivity. Total disaster. Well, as fortune, fate and the providence of God would have it while the remnant of the Jewish people are in captivity in Persia. One of their leaders, Cyrus the Great, is like, you know what, we should let you guys go home and rebuild your temple and worship your God and kind of govern yourselves. I'm like, all right. So they go back. This is where you get the stories of Ezra and Nehemiah and the Old Testament and they rebuild things and they're like, we are not going to screw it up again. We're pretty sure we know what we got wrong. And so we're going to double and triple down on a whole bunch of these rules where we think we might have made mistakes. Now God is going to be happy and he will bless us and the nations will know that he is God and we are his people and it's going to work out. But like I said, they're playing a multi-generational game of one away. How sure are these religious leaders that they are changing the things they were getting wrong and sticking with the things that they are getting right? Because if they got that backwards, then all of a sudden now they're doing everything wrong and probably the temple would get destroyed again. So it's one of those things where once you make a commitment in one away, you've got to stick with it and not let it get in your head. Well, these people over the generations were playing religious one away the right way. They were sticking to their guns and insisting that this is what it's going to take to get things right and honor God as we have discussed multiple times. Enter Matthew chapter 15 and yet another confrontation between Jesus and the elite religious leadership goes like this. Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat. Jesus replied, and why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? For God said, honor your father and your mother and anyone who curses his father and mother must be put to death. But you say that if a man says to his father and mother, hey, whatever help you might have otherwise received from me is a gift devoted to God. You say that he's not to honor his father with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites, Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain. Their teachings are but rules taught by men. So pretty evidently Jesus isn't seeing this situation the same way as the religious leaders and what Jesus is referencing in this complete verbal beatdown is Isaiah chapter 29, which at least in my Bible is titled, woe on Judah, which is where they just came from. And what we're going to see here is a Regis, some of Isaiah 29 is that this would not be a cherished favorite passage of the Bible for anybody in the original audience. This is one of the passages where God reminds them of the deal that was made with Moses. It's like, this is what I said was going to happen. And now I'm just reminding you of that. Here's how it's going to look. Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel. That's a nickname for Jerusalem, the city where David settled. See, there it is right there in the text. Add year to year and let your cycle of festivals go on. Yet I will besiege Ariel. She will mourn and lament. She'll beat me like an altar hearth. I will encamp against you all around you. I will encircle you with towers and set up my siege works against you. And there's a whole bunch more stuff about what the military encroachment is going to look like and all the bad things that are coming the way of Jerusalem being carried out by the nations, but ultimately God is taking credit for what's about to happen to them. He says, be stunned and amazed. Blind yourselves and be sightless, be drunk, but not from wine, stagger, but not from beer. The Lord has brought over you a deep sleep. He has sealed your eyes. The prophets. He has covered your heads. There's that eyes to see ears to hear thing again that Jesus keeps harkening back to. And then we bounce down a couple verses and we find out why God is going to do this. And verse 13, it says, the Lord says, these people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men. Therefore, once more, I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder. The wisdom of the wise will perish. The intelligence of the intelligent will vanish. And then after that, there's like 10 more verses of the same kind of stuff, not much fun. I'm looking at the time. I've got a bunch more that I want to process about this, but I'm also noticing that these episode lengths are starting to creep up consistently toward 13 minutes. And I don't want them to be that long because I want this to keep fitting into your day. So I'm going to cut this conversation in half and we're going to pick up right where we left off tomorrow and round out this thought, giving it the proper amount of time without cramming it all down into a timeframe where it doesn't fit. So more on the religious leaderships failed game of one away and Jesus calling that out, manana. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
