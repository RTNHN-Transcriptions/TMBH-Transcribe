This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. We got one of those trampoline places in town. Do you have one of those? They're almost always steel buildings out in some industrial park on the edge of town. And that's how it is where we live, too. But inside that steel building, you've got something that is sort of like the modern equivalent of what roller skating rinks used to be. There's a snack bar, you go in, you got to change out of your shoes, very roller skating rink like. And there's usually some music planned, they dim the lights a little bit, and you jump around, you do active things, and you socialize with other people. It's a nice time. And we went through the night. It was pretty cool. And of course, they don't want you wearing your filthy disgusting ratty shoes while you're running around in there. But they also understand that some people, because of certain grooming habits that they embrace, they just don't wear socks. And so they don't really want people running around with their nasty, disease-infected feet all over their trampolines and everything either. And so you have the option there to be afforded a pair of socks. And the socks they give you, they're really cool. They actually get this rubberized stuff on the bottom, so it makes it even stickier. So you can really plant the landing when you're doing flips and all of that business. But the deal is, look, if you're going to be at the jump place, you just have to have on a certain type of attire. That's just what you do at the jump place. And if you don't, you're going to get talked to. And if you're not willing to wear the socks, like, I'm sorry, you're going to have to go to some other jump place. Likewise in Matthew chapter 22, we got a situation where there's a wedding banquet, and though I don't exactly understand what the ground rules were in the first century, apparently there's a certain outfit that you're supposed to wear, like a certain type of wedding attire. I don't even think it's like just look nice. The text of Matthew 22 and the assumptions behind it starting in verse 11 and running through verse 14. Give me the impression that the original audience and Jesus would have had in mind an expectation for a fancy wedding kind of thing where people dress with some degree of uniformity. And that's part of the celebration. And that's part of what you do. And it'd be really weird to go to such a thing, not dressed in the attire that is prescribed for that wedding. Maybe the closest thing we could associate this with when it comes to a wedding would be like the groomsmen get ups or the bridesmaids dresses. Usually there's some uniformity there and it would be weird if Tori was one of your groomsmen and he showed up wearing some Zubaz pants and one of those black see through mesh tank tops that I'm seeing that are becoming so popular these days. I mean, in that situation, understandably, people would look at Tori and they'd be like, dude, you're not taking this seriously. Come on. It's clearly a big deal for everybody. Could you at least just wear the bow tie with your sleeveless mesh tank top? Thank you, dude. Well, it's such an offense in this parable of Jesus that we're hearing that there's some punishment that goes along with it. It's not just social stigma. It's kind of a deal. Now, maybe in this parable that we're looking at, the king here has frayed nerves and maybe we should read this parable and understand that he's been through a lot and he's just not messing around anymore. Like, we're just we're doing a wedding party and let's make it nice, but I think there's more going on. So to summarize, here's how we got here. This parable of the wedding banquet, Jesus says the kingdom of heaven is like a king who's going to have a wedding banquet for his kid, the prince, the son and he invited a bunch of people, presumably nobility and presumably they all agreed to come because you don't throw the party if they all say no. And then it comes time to have everything ready to go. And it's a little unpredictable as to when that will be because of the way the supply chain pre refrigeration age works, but he has everything ready to go, sends out his servants like, all right, just go bring everybody in. It's time to get cracking. And all the people who were invited, the landed entitled nobility types are like, no, I'm just not feeling it. And they don't go. And the king sends the messengers back out and they're like, no, I'm definitely not going. But a few of them even get so irritated at the re invite that they kill the servants that are sent and the king's super mad and he goes and burns their cities, burns their property and puts them to the sword. And then he comes back and he tells the not murdered servants to just go out to the street corners or the highways and the byways or the place where the sidewalk ends, whatever out to places where you wouldn't get fancy guests and just bring them in good and bad and invite them all to the party. Let's just see what we get. We're going to do this thing. And somehow in the invitation of the good and the bad and the whole mess, the king feels that he will be properly regarded as king and that his son will be properly honored. And the hall is filled with guests and everybody's eating the food and it's working out. And that's where we get to this weird part about wedding attire that rounds the thing out. But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who is not wearing wedding clothes. Friend, he asked, how'd you get in here without wearing wedding clothes? The man was speechless. Then the king told the attendants, time, hand and foot and throw them outside into the darkness where they'll be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are invited, but few are chosen. Okay. First off, I am with you. That seems really rash on the surface. It seems really extreme. Again, maybe we could chalk this up to just, it's been kind of a long day. All right. But also it should be noted that the people who killed the king's servants, they got violent punishment. Or is this guy more just got the old bouncer kick out? I don't know about the tying up and everything I've never seen a bouncer tie someone up when they throw them out. But I assume that this is the first century equivalent of get out of here, dirty rat and don't ever come back. They throw you out kind of thing. I would love to say that I have gone and cracked the code of what first century Judean, Galilean writing feast practices and expectations were exactly like, but I don't know. And digging around, I'm not finding uniform enough sources. It seems like there's a lot of speculation about this. So you and I were just going to work off the text here and do our best to understand what's going on. What I can say is this real sneaky like and the otherwise beautiful part of the passage where the king sends the servants out to go and bring in whomever it does clearly say, bring them all in good, bad, whatever. So we shouldn't be surprised if we were reading closely when in the very next passage we run into somebody who didn't get it, who didn't assume the right posture. Now there are some people who I have read who suggest, I've heard this in sermons and stuff on this passage too, that the king in this situation would provide everyone with wedding clothes as they arrived. This was part of the blessing that he would provide to them. And I haven't been able to find any actual evidence for that out in the larger world, in the larger history of the region. So I don't know what sources they're looking at. Maybe that's true. Maybe that's not if the folks who think that are right, then that would indicate that this person either sneaked in and he wasn't on the invite list, even though it was a very altered invite list. He wasn't among the good or the bad who were invited at all. And so he is going to get kicked out because he never even was invited. Now it's kind of hard to figure out what the spiritual meaning of that would be or how that's what the kingdom of heaven is like based on the rest of the Bible. But I don't know, maybe it's parable. It requires a little bit of interpretation and read between the lines. So some folks would say, kings provided people with wedding clothes. If this guy didn't have the wedding clothes, he sneaked in. Other people would say, kings provided people with wedding clothes. And so if somebody doesn't have the wedding clothes on, they rejected the wedding clothes, a lot like the people who rejected the invitation in the first place. This is a little more interesting here. Again, I can't vouch for the king gives everybody wedding clothes thing. But if that is true and this wasn't a sneak in, but it was instead I'm not wearing your stupid clothes kind of issue, then ah, this is a parallel rejection. The first half of the parable then would describe what the rejection looks like when fancy people do it and the second half of the parable then would describe what a rejection of the king looks like when not fancy people do it. And then the point would be, hey, fancy, not fancy, like everybody has the capacity to assume the right posture before the king and everybody also has the capacity to reject it, even though that rejection may look a little bit different on the outside. And whatever the case, the king here who if we assume the king is God, then, you know, we liken that to what we've seen throughout the rest of Matthew where we've seen time and time again. Jesus knew what they were thinking. He knew their hearts. And so as shocking as this might seem in the larger context of the one who's the perfect judge being able to evaluate exactly where people are coming from and what their motives are and what they're doing, maybe we're supposed to read it in that context and be like, oh, well, it'd be weird if I did this, but maybe this king who is representative of God has the capacity to see this stuff and make sense of it the way they need to. And yeah, I got a lot more than I want to get through on this one. So we're going to split it in half and we're going to pick it up where we left off. Manana, please pardon the abruptness, but I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
