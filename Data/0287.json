I think it's in poor taste, but I'm going to make an exception today. A lot of you might not realize that I studied at Oxford. And by that, I mean, I brought a book there one time on a long layover and read it for about 15 minutes within the city limits technically of the community of Oxford in the UK. But the people who actually studied at Oxford where they went and got degrees and took actual classes, there's a reason that they have caused to brag. There's an amazing intellectual academic tradition associated with that town. And two of the literary rock stars of the previous century were there working at the same time, that being C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. And then we get together and they would hang out and there's this one particular little pub where they like to hang out called the Eagle and Child. I got to go there with my buddy Aaron when we were rolling through Oxford that one time when I studied there for 15 minutes. And it's fun to read the stories about what these guys talked about in there, how they debated their approaches to storytelling. C.S. Lewis, of course, is famous for the Chronicles of Narnia, which are a little bit more allegorical in approach. And J.R.R.R. Tolkien is, of course, very famous for the world of Middle-Earth that he invented, including The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, the Silmarillion Stories, and Tolkien's work is drenched in deep, meaningful, thematic material. But it's not as allegorical as Lewis. And my understanding is that they would debate and rib each other a little bit about what is the better way to tell a story. And Tolkien even went so far at one point to say something like he didn't like the smell of allegory. He was turned off by this. I don't know if he was just having a bad week or gotten a grouchy fight with his buddy Lewis, but it holds true when you read their work. Of course, if you go and read something like Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, you see an even thicker degree of allegory. This means this, where even naming the characters after their attributes or what they represent. And so theme and symbolism and parallelism and allegory in story is really something that's on a sliding scale. On the far end to our right, let's imagine, would be the none of this means anything rather nihilistic. This is just an accounting of things because I think the story is interesting kind of storytelling. And all the way on the other end, I'm calling it the left end of the spectrum would be everything means something. And you should read as deeply into this as possible. Parables like Jesus uses in his teaching fall very far to the left end of that spectrum. Almost everything in the parables means something. It runs parallel to some spiritual truth, some corollary. And sometimes what we see with Jesus parables is that he finishes telling them in the text and then he circles back around to clue us in as to what those parables meant. Other times, I guess it's just supposed to be obvious enough that you can figure out what's going on there. So in chapter 13 of the book of Matthew, we get just a wall of parables, tons of them and tons of parables that you've heard before. All of these are probably going to be familiar and it sets up like this starting in verse 1 of Matthew 13. That same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake, such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it while all the people stood at the shore. Then he told them many things in parables saying, so Matthew's doing us a literary favor here. He's giving us a cue to say here is the genre you're about to encounter so that you can have your antenna out as you read it for the first time for what the whole thing means. Now parables are not just a morality play. They're not just a quaint little lesson or a cautionary tale, though there may be morality in them. And though there may be a cautionary tale in them, more so these parables are designed to reveal things that you might miss in a more cold academic discourse about the nature of the kingdom. Jesus is holding himself out as a king, Matthew is holding Jesus out as a king. The first speech around which the book of Matthew is built, the Sermon on the Mount, starting in Matthew chapter 5, that's straight discourse. Is Jesus going right through the front door? It's the Kool-Aid man approach to describing the kingdom. Hey, I'm here. Here's exactly how all the things are. It's pretty on the nose. It demonstrated that he taught with enormous amounts of authority and it connected with a whole bunch of people. But a lot of people didn't resonate with it. Clearly, they didn't get it. They were still intrigued or they were even very angry. And so I almost feel like as we get into Matthew chapter 13 and the emphasis shifts more toward the parable side of things that we're taking, I want to say another run like Jesus first attempted explaining this wasn't very good, but a different style of run with a different type of learner in mind to use modern parlance. Additionally, it seems like he's switching over to the parable approach to things instead of the overt through the front door approach to things in keeping with this eyes to see ears to hear theme that we've had developing over the last few chapters. And blind people get in healed. And then right after that, people who should be able to see can't see. You've got Jesus turning his attention to his father in heaven at the end of chapter 11, saying, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you've hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good purpose. And so there's this idea that the obvious stuff is already there. Like, y'all probably should have seen enough to get what was going on. The parables then are an opportunity to dive deeper into the heart of this truer, realer kingdom stuff, but not everybody's going to get it even after Jesus completely spells out what some of these parables mean. If you're on the front end of reading the Lord of the Rings or the Chronicles of Narnia and somebody who's already been through it is there with you, they might be able to make that first reading more profitable by saying, hey, just keep an eye out for the theme of power and its corrupting ability. If you're looking for that going in, your first read through is going to be a lot more profitable. If somebody were to say regarding the lie on the witch and the wardrobe to a new reader, keep an eye out for the theme of failure, sin, redemption, and the price of redemption as you read through that one. Well, even though in the case of the lie on the witch and the wardrobe, it'd be pretty hard to miss those themes. You would still then as a first time reader have your antenna out for it all the more. Likewise, as we look at the parables, just a couple of little things that maybe we want to keep an eye out for. One, the small details are important. There are a couple of these things where if we don't pay close attention, we can assign a completely different meaning just by swapping out a couple of corollaries that Jesus very specifically establishes. I see that happen a lot when people talk about the parable of the wheat and the tears that happens here in Matthew chapter 13. They're like, ah, the wheat and the tears, that is a story about church, the field where these things get planted. That's the church. But Jesus specifically says in Matthew 1338, the field is the world. Oh, it's not the church. It's the world. And we'll get into it while that matters later on. But it's really easy to butcher the understanding of that parable by simply missing or ignoring the interpretive parameters that Jesus puts on it. Another thing to look for is that parables often have a twist, which makes sense because the kingdom looks a little bit like the world kingdom, but the values are upside down. So it seems familiar. And then you look a little closer and you're like, whoa, that is a very different animal that I'm dealing here with the kingdom kingdom versus the world kingdom. And so it would make sense that the parables that are talking about the kingdom kingdom would also cause you to do a double take a time. So wait, why would that character behave that way? Whoa, I didn't see it going that direction. Well, this is how it is with the kingdom because the kingdom isn't like the world systems you're used to. And to me, it seems that the sermon on the mount is jarring to a certain degree as we intellectually make the contrast between the kingdom kingdom values and the world kingdom values. But this kingdom parables discourse is jarring at a more visceral level. And the story is going along, you're just flowing with it. This feels like the kind of story you're used to. And then something happens. It's disruptive, confusing, curious. It just doesn't square at the level of the intuition and it forces you to have to wrestle with that. A couple other themes to keep an eye out for here as we get into these kingdom parables would include the outward focused, always growing impulse of the kingdom, the incredible value of the kingdom and the superintendents over the unfolding of the kingdom by the king who is very much paying attention to what is going on and who is very much invested in it. Even though in a few of these parables, it might look to some of the characters like, oh, you're doing it wrong. You're superintending the thing wrong. But in the end, the story always vindicates the king, the god character, who knows exactly what he's doing with the kingdom and he's managing it exactly right. But the outside observer would look at it and say, well, based on world kingdom values, they're not managing it right and they're again implicitly as the contrast between world kingdom stuff and kingdom kingdom stuff. So as we roll into this, bear in mind, we are shifting genre here. This is going to feel a little bit different. We're going to have to think about it a little bit differently, but it's pointing in the exact same direction as everything else we've heard about the king and the kingdom. I think next time around, we're ready to actually get in to the first of these parables, which is about a guy who paid a bunch of money to get a whole bunch of seeds and then went through them in seemingly dumb places.
