This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. And as we have discussed so many times, stories have beats. Now not all stories are exactly the same. Some of them are structured different ways. They say there are seven or eight different types of stories. But one of the ones that tends to transcend time and culture and that we can just do again and again and again and we keep loving it is the hero centric story. It's the story of the little nobody who demonstrated a few signs of promise in their simple little backwoods that they came from and then adventure comes their way and they have to respond to that call to adventure and then they rise to the moment and those little attributes grow into big versions of those same attributes and they have what it takes to be a hero to slay the dragons within them so they can slay the dragons external to them. It's absolutely timeless. And once you know this storytelling structure, you start to see it everywhere because it is everywhere. But a big part of the fun of that kind of story is that usually you get to meet the hero when they're still a nobody and usually you get introduced to their environment, their setting and it's a pretty comfortable one, but it's not comfortable because it's perfect. It's comfortable because the hero has figured out how to completely handle their business in this environment. They've got the character and they've got the skill set to make an easy time of navigating this world in which they live. Luke Skywalker knows how to handle his business on Tatooine. Bilbo and Frodo Baggins know how to socially navigate the beautiful but gossipy shire. Neo knows how to navigate the gray, bleak, work-a-day techno nightmare world in which he lives. Heck, even though I think the Star Wars sequels were terrible, Rey is introduced in the same way. She knows how to navigate the world in which she lives. And so as a result, the hero to be is in a position of great comfort and when someone in distress or with a great opportunity shows up and invites them on an adventure, they of course at first balk at that adventure. But then usually what happens is that circumstances quickly change and the adventure sort of comes to them. They become thrust into that adventure, unable to hold on to the status quo where they are comfortable and that's when the story gets interesting and that's when the character really begins to evolve and ultimately that hero character is going to end up on a collision course with their own flaws as well as some big external enemy. Well, likewise in the book of Esther, we've got a main character who has really only been on screen a minimal amount of the time through three chapters. But we know she's going to be the one on whom at all hinges and this main character, Queen Esther, who's already taken big steps forward, she is about to find herself on a collision course with her own weakness and with a big evil external enemy, obviously Heyman. And furthermore, like so many other great heroes we read about, she is going to balk at the initial invitation to adventure. The initial invitation to throw off her comfortable setting risk at all to go and fight for something that actually matters. I don't think this is a knock against her in any kind of meaningful way. I think this is how heroes are made and this is how these kinds of stories are told. Here's how it goes down. At the end of Esther chapter three, Xerxes and Heyman have issued their edict to say they're going to kill all the Jewish people. Mordecai finds out about it in the beginning of chapter four. He's understandably very upset and makes that known publicly as do Jews throughout the Persian Empire and all the provinces as they find out about it and respond in a similar way to Mordecai. But up till this point, we still haven't heard anything about what's going on with Esther. What did she think about this decree? Pick it up in verse four of Esther chapter four. When Esther's maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he wouldn't accept them. Then Esther summoned half-atch, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why. Why did you catch that? She doesn't know. Esther isn't aware of the edict. Sure, all of Sousa is bewildered, but this tells us a little bit about her sad, sheltered life. I guess it could have been worse. She could have lost and ended up with the rest of the totally disposable harem, but said she won the contest. It looks like for a while she had the king's attention, but as we're going to read forward here, we're going to see that it doesn't look like she has his attention as much lately. We can talk more about why that might have been in a future conversation. Even though this edict was probably composed and issued and stamped just a couple doors down from wherever she's usually hanging out, she has no idea it's going on. Now, you might think somebody would rush right over and tell her, but remember, nobody knows that she's Jewish. So why would they tell her anything that's really going on with the king's business? Her job is to be pretty and please the king when she comes to his mind. That's kind of it, not offer input on matters of state, let alone matters of state with stakes so high. In the end, it's going to turn out to be providentially awesome that nobody knew that she was Jewish, but it's just crazy. Everybody else in the whole province knows about this thing and the lady who is right there next to the seat of power, she has absolutely no idea. So when she hears about what's going on with Mordecai, she's trying to find out what's wrong. She doesn't get it. She doesn't know. Here's some better clothes. Put these on. Why are you being like this? What's up? That's when out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate, Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews. How did he know that? I think this Mordecai fellow had a lot of little birds that would chirp to him and tell him about things going on hither and tither. I think the same skill set that enabled him to have an ear out for the plot against King Xerxes life a couple of pages earlier here is the same skill set that is coming into play here with him knowing all the details about what's going on with Haman. Probably would have weirded out half thatch a little bit. I mean, because eunuchs, they've got the ear to the ground and that's their whole job is to be dialed into their network of little spiders who tell them exactly what's going on, hither and tither. I think half thatch would have imagined that internal discussion about how much we're going to pay to kill the Jews would have been just that internal. So there's probably a moment of realization that's happening during that conversation where this eunuch is like, dang, I'm kind of dealing with a big leaguer here who's got his own little network of spies and birds and spiders that tell him things that he would need to know. So then in verse eight, it says he, Mordecai, also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa to show to Esther and explain it to her. And he told him that is Mordecai told the eunuch to urge Esther to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people. Now, on the surface, it seems like the simplest thing in the world because you're probably picturing your parents or your spouse or some people you know who are married or some people you've seen who were married on a sitcom or something like, well, you just go right in there and talk how hard can it be. But remember, the greatest, most valuable commodity in the world at this point in history is access to the throne of the accumulated king of Persia. You don't just give something away that is that valuable even to Queen Esther. She doesn't get to just walk in and see the king. The king summons her and we're going to find out as we look further ahead in this passage tomorrow that it's been a while. Remember for you and me, it's been one page since Esther was the talk of the town. But in terms of Xerxes reign, it's been about a third of his total reign that is elapsed in this time. And it would seem that she is not as much on his radar anymore. And this is not as simple as just waltz right in and make a request. So what we're going to see tomorrow is just like when you watch a movie and you want the action to happen and you're rooting for the hero and you're rooting for the evil to be defeated and you're like, well, there you go. You got to call to action. Take it. And you're kind of like, what? Why are you bulking at the call to action? You're supposed to be the hero. Come on, you got to go do the thing. We're going to feel that same emotion as we see Esther try to preserve the status quo that is comfortable and not pursue this adventure. Takes a little bit of persuasion before she is going to heed the call to adventure and get after it. Further, this heeding of the call to adventure is complicated by the fact that she doesn't really get to have any direct contact with the guy who is making the call to action. Mordecai, they have such a strange, distant relationship because of the isolated nature of Esther's existence in the palace. So it's not as simple as just go chat with the king and get him to cancel his thing. We don't lightly cancel edicts in Persia. And one does not simply, yes, I'm making the gesture with my hand, walk into the presence of the king, even if you happen to be the king's wife, just doesn't work that way. More on all of those tricky dynamics and what it's going to take to get this heroine in waiting out of her comfort zone and into the adventure realm next time around. I'm Matt.
