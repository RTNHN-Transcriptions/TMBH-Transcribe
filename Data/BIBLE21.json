Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Ecclesiastes. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. Thanks for hanging out with me and talking about the book of Ecclesiastes, which I've been sitting here thinking about it, so I can already tell my tone is different than it normally is on these because it's so somber and reflective, and this book has resonated with me and touched my heart at every point of my story as a person, because it deals with the question that everybody asks at some point, not even at some point, at multiple points over the course of their life, but we ask this question in different ways over the course of our lives, and that question is, what's the point? What am I doing here? What is all of this activity I'm engaged in even mean? Even the beautiful stuff about life even mean. Ecclesiastes is part of the wisdom and writing literature of the Old Testament, along with Job, Psalms and Proverbs, and then Ecclesiastes, and then the Song of Songs or Song of Solomon. Now, on the surface, it looks like Ecclesiastes is holding itself out as being written probably by Solomon. This is the opening line. The words of the preacher or the teacher, the son of David, King in Jerusalem. They're on in the book, the first person author talks about how they were wiser than anybody else and all of their achievements and money and wealth, and they talk about the holiness of that stuff. So it really does seem to line up that this is Solomon, which can then cause the reader to be like, well, probably the companion book in this wisdom literature to Ecclesiastes then would be Proverbs, because they both look like they have a whole lot of Solomon in them, but I don't think that's the case. I think the companion book of Ecclesiastes is Job, but where Job tackles the suffering end of things, Ecclesiastes is tackling another difficult emotion, but it's one that can be born out of the exact opposite of suffering. It's one that can be born out of everything going great. Ecclesiastes is tackling that numb feeling, that melancholy that can set in even when we're getting the things we want, but then quickly realize this isn't satisfying. This is a very real part of the entire human experience, at least after early childhood, and it would be weird if the Bible never tackled that. So high five Bible, great job for dealing with the big questions that people deal with in a way that we can relate to, and in a way that isn't weird and preachy. Ecclesiastes comes alongside you no matter where you're at in life, no matter what is prompted you to ask the question, what's the point? And it puts an arm around you and is like, hey, I get it. We all get to that question at some point. Welcome. Let's think about it together and I'll honestly share my experiences with you, says the author of Ecclesiastes. But the bigger question on the front end for understanding Ecclesiastes is what do you do with this one word that is clearly the hinge word, the theme word of the whole thing? It's a word that the original audience would have understood, or else this book wouldn't have stood the test of time. Nobody would have got it. Nobody would have resonated with it. But it is apparently pretty difficult to translate, and this word is Hevel. The English versions of the Bible I read when I was a kid translated this word Hevel as meaningless. So then Ecclesiastes would open saying meaningless, meaningless says the teacher. Everything is meaningless. What does a man get from all of his toil? And then in other translations that I read now, I see this word being rendered as vanity. But then somewhere along the way in school somebody pointed out to me that this word Hevel just means vapor, just something incorporeal that you can see and it's there and it's real. But you cannot grab it. You can't take hold of that. And I got to tell you, I feel that Hevel thing so deeply. I have these weird emotions from time to time where I'll be so overcome with the beauty of a thing that the thought that I can't hold it and keep it will bring me to tears. I don't think I'm a fragile person. I don't cry at the drop of a hat, but every now and then this Hevel thing gets me. I had a beautiful dinner with a dear friend in a beautiful place to celebrate his birthday. Just two of us sitting down. And at the end of the meal I cried. I had to apologize, but the best I could explain it was I just value our friendship so much. And I just am overwhelmed by the beauty of this place and reflecting on the miles we've covered together and the miles that we have ahead of us together as friends. Unfortunately, he was really understanding and nice about it. I cried one time after a deep, beautiful, meaningful conversation with my wife, just because it occurred to me. I won't be able to have these forever in the same context in the same way. This is one of the most tender, meaningful things I'll ever know in my entire existence, but I can't hold it. Watching my daughter play piano at a recital the other day. Same thing, why am I crying? I mean, the performance is beautiful, the art is beautiful, but I'm crying because of Hevel. I wrestle with my kids, I hit the tennis ball around with them, I put my arms around them, and watch some silly TV show at night and I'll find myself misting up because I can't hold this forever because Hevel. I go stand in a stream in the mountains and I catch a beautiful brook trout with amazing colors and I lift it out and I have that moment of contact with another living thing. From a totally different world, we should never have this moment of touch, and yet we do for just a moment. And before the water on it dries, I put it back in the stream and let it go. And I feel this deep sense of emotion that even though physically I could touch that, I can't keep it. I relate to Job because I relate to suffering. I've dealt with hard things, not things like Job dealt with, but I relate even more to Ecclesiastes because of how much I've been blessed and how much beauty I've seen in my life and how much it hurts my heart that I can't hold it and I can't own it. But here's what's awesome about that. And here's where I think I resonate with the author of Ecclesiastes, or maybe he resonates with me, is that inability to hold it according to the book of Ecclesiastes is good. It's meant to prompt you toward a thing that you can hold. It's meant to prompt you toward something that is truer and realer and lasting. Thank you for indulging me on that. I realize I got wildly personal. Well, Ecclesiastes gets it and that's evident in the structure. It opens with one of the two things that make this heavy vapor phenomenon a reality, and that is the passage of time. It deals with that question. And then in basically the last section before the little conclusion at the very end, it deals with mortality. The other thing that makes heavy a reality from our perspective. And in the middle, it deals with the obvious response in light of time and death. What do you do? What can you chase down? Where can you find that meaning? And it goes through and basically the author says, I tried this, I tried this, I tried this, I tried this, you can too. But ultimately it all fails to satisfy this. Nothing, not money, not fame, not power, not sex. Nothing can make that which you cannot truly hold. Nothing can take that vapor and make it something that you own and that you have and that you can count on forever. And that's maybe why some people have translated this heavy word meaningless. But again, I don't think that's the best translation because it's not meaningless. It's the very fact that it is so meaningful, but so fleeting and not apprehensable that makes it powerful and that creates this melancholy reflection that people like me go through. So it looks like the way the book is setting up as we get through the middle of it and toward the second half is like, okay, we got the whole thing, it's framed by time and mortality. And here's some constructive proposals that are bad. And now we're going to get the constructive proposal that is trite and good. And indeed in the second half of the book, we pivot toward a constructive proposal. This sounds more like the one that we got from L.A. Hugh, the Bousite from Job, where it's like, all right, well, the answer is like God and Christianity and religion, like believe in God more and do more godly things. And then that will work. But then in this surprise move from the teacher, the author we're hearing from here, he's like, that's kind of vapor too. Wait, what? God is vapor? Christianity is vapor? The Bible is vapor doing good things. What are you talking about, man? But the point he seems to be making is even that in this lifetime, you can't truly hold. You have it, but time and mortality still march on, and only God is truly holding and owning all of these things that for us are constantly slipping through the fingers. Now don't get me wrong, he's by no means saying, oh, there's no answers in God or anything, so forget that. Rather, he's saying that when you are bound to this physical body with death awaiting you on the horizon, there's just only so much you're ever going to be able to take hold of anything, even the things of God. Ultimately, God owns that and putting your trust in God, much like the conclusion of Job, the teacher in Ecclesiastes is then saying, your only play here is to trust in God, because only God truly owns things, only God can truly put something in his hand. Only God paraphrases mine now, but I think it's there. Only God can take hevel and make it something that is forever, something that is apprehendable. Rather than the teacher's counter-proposal to all of the other proposals is to trust God, to drink deeply of God's good gifts and to take those good gifts in this lifetime, even though we can't fully apprehend them to take those in anticipation as a first fruit of a more realized and eternal goodness that comes later at the hands of God. And whether that's comfortable or not, this is the only way in a reality where all is hevel. The reiteration of this in the little epilogue that we get at the end of chapter 12, where the teacher points us to God's justice and judgment and that one day all of this will change, but that that's beyond our control. And the teacher also says, hey, my friend, big time paraphrases mine here. There's only so far you can go with all of this. Don't take your whole life and become a slave to this question. So he urges the reader to make the pivot, to understand the nature of this reality, and for that to urge the reader toward knowing God, trusting God, and to understand that God transcends hevel. When we get to the New Testament, we're going to see that the apostle Paul wrestled with this and seemed to understand it. In Philippians 3, he famously says that he hasn't been able to obtain this thing that he's pursuing, but that he presses on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of him. In 1 Corinthians 13, he famously talks about knowing in part and prophesying in part with the indication that he understands that the things of the right now are hevel, but that is not permanent in God. And heck, there's even that hymn that says, God haste the day when my faith becomes sight. So Ecclesiastes is important beyond just this deep existential set of questions that you and I ask, it undergirds a right understanding of living in this world while in relationship with God and anticipating eternity with God under a very different set of ground rules. When you visualize the book of Ecclesiastes, picture vapor solidifying in the hands of God. When you think about the theme, let me let's just go with the main phrase, all is hevel. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, catch the opening segment about time in chapter 1, the almost closing segment about mortality in chapter 11 and into chapter 12, and then read the resolution that we were just talking about that runs on through the end of the book at the end of chapter 12. All right, it sounds a little trite to say given how deep the water of Ecclesiastes is, but achievement unlocked? I think we just leveled up together. I know every trip through Ecclesiastes is the new most meaningful trip I've ever had through Ecclesiastes, and that was the case again this time. So thanks for being on the other end of this to push me to do that. I really appreciate it. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
