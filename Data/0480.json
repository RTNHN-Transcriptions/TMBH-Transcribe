He's really good at it. Razor sharp, super attentive. Everything is so organized. Products, so good. Atmosphere is great. He's really excellent at what he does. And part of why he's so excellent at it is that he's great at getting the best out of youthful employees. But every now and then, as you can imagine, would be the case when you run a business, you've got to let people go. And he's told me some of the stories of why he's had to let some of his teenage employees go and what that process has been like. It's tough on him. But also, it's a pretty simple math equation as he articulates it. He wants everybody he hires to succeed. Why would he hire them if he wanted them to fail? I mean, they're going to be working on his project. But if they can't make the thing that the business makes and serve it to the public in a way that makes the public happy, well, then you're not doing the thing that you're there to do. And there's only so many employee spots on the roster. And the one who is unproductive, unfruitful in their work just has to be replaced with somebody who is going to be fruitful in their work in order for the big project that he's responsible for to get going. As we get to Matthew chapter 21, we run into a situation where there is a firing occurring. If you're just rolling along through Matthew and you're not paying close attention, it might sound like just one more unfriendly exchange between Jesus and the religious leadership. But that is not the case at all. In Matthew 21, Jesus announces that God is firing this religious leadership and that custody stewardship ownership management of the metaphorical vineyard that God is nurturing and that he owns and that he expects to produce fruit that that management is going to be shifted to someone else. This is a powerfully schismatic moment between Christianity and Judaism. And Jesus knows full well what he's saying here. And Matthew knows full well what he's doing here by repeating it. The stakes are very high and the warning signs have been evident throughout the book of Matthew that this is where it's headed. Now I've argued several times, both in sympathy for and criticism of the religious leadership here in the first century that we've been meeting in the book of Matthew, that these are people who are humans like you or me. They make mistakes that you or I could make. They get things right probably from time to time though. You don't see it on the page much in ways that maybe you or I could get it right. I hope that I've been fair in pointing out that these people are pretty sophisticated and pretty smart. They just ran into a buzz song. Jesus like, yeah, yeah, you got a good team. But come on, team Jesus is absolutely on fire here, in part because team Jesus has the advantage of him being a cagey veteran who's existed since before time began and he just doubt shines out performs the religious leadership at every turn. But that doesn't mean they're not sophisticated or competent. I think the reason that the tension of the book of Matthew between Jesus and the religious leadership keeps building is because they're, they can read the writing on the wall. They're not inept. They see what's coming. They can tell that all of this language that we looked at yesterday about fruitfulness and the expectations of God and how all of that language draws on Old Testament imagery, they can see this is an indictment of us. He is fixing to denounce us. He is fixing to depose us. He is fixing to fire us and replace us with someone else. I'm sure that when they got together at Applebee's or Chili's and they got their gigantic margaritas and they sat around and schemed it out and reviewed the way the conversation went and broke it down ad nauseam and worked on their next plan. I'm sure they were like, he's not saying it, but he's saying it. He's going to fire us. He's done with us. That's what's coming. We have to do something. We need to protect the children and church and God. Then if that just happens to keep us employed, so be it, our quest is noble. And sure enough, we get to chapter 21 and we find that Jesus, the representative of the boss, the owner of the vineyard does find their work to be woefully inadequate and indeed they are going to be fired and replaced. Here's the passage that we were talking about yesterday. I didn't have time to read it, but this is the one that we've been talking about for the last couple of days. Listen to another parable. This is Jesus talking. There's a landowner who planted a vineyard and he put a wall around it, dug a wine press in it and built a watchtower. So it's a nice vineyard and he did all the work and paid for it. He's entitled to its fruits. That's the point. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. Okay. He's going to get paid in this culture in a significant share of the bounty of the harvest. So if the tenants do a terrible job of nurturing the vineyard and it produces a tiny little harvest, even if he gets his percentage share, you still got to get rid of those guys because it's not about the percent. I mean, it's kind of about the percent, but it's about the quality of the work because I don't want 50% of basically nothing. I want 50% of the full potential of this vineyard. When the harvest time approach, you send his servants and the tenants to collect his fruit. The tenants seized his servants. They beat one, killed another and stoned a third. My goodness, these people are a moral train wreck. They're a murderous lot. Not only are they inept and awful at their job, but they're violent when people pointed out. So I think not then he sent other servants to them more than the first time and the tenants treated them all the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. They'll respect my son. He said, but when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, this is the air. Come on, let's kill him and we'll take his inheritance. So they took him through him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants? This question is being asked to the very people who are being criticized by this parable, making him some kind of tone. Surely, they're not so naive that they just didn't catch that this was about them. They replied, they'll bring those wretches to a wretched end and it'll rent the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the crop at the harvest time. Jesus said to them, have you never read the scriptures? The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone. The Lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes. Therefore, I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. Boom. And with that, there can't Jesus speaking as what everybody has been describing as a prophet. He's a prophet. Remember, they were just saying that all around Jerusalem. Everybody believes he's a prophet and that he speaks with the authority of God. He just went to the religious leadership. People in charge of church, so to speak. I was like, yeah, a message from God, you're canned. You're done. It's over. You've been given to your ineptitude and complete mismanagement of this thing you've been trusted with your inability to generate any kind of a return on this rich, wellspring, this rich opportunity you've been given in addition to that ineptitude. You're also evil and murderous and corrupt. And don't even argue with me because you're going to murder me here in just a couple of pages. Speaking of vineyards using pretty much the exact strategy that ahab and Jezebel, the worst people ever used to kill innocent neighbors so they could take his vineyard from him. You are about to pull that. You're about to be ahab and Jezebel. So you're inept and you're evil and you're fired. And it doesn't matter what you do. This inheritance, this job, this task, this role that you've had, it's not going to be yours anymore. And there's going to be a new people who will better tend to it. Now, if you look at the parable, how can this even be hard? Like, obviously, come on, you got to fire people from time to time. Just like my buddy, you got to run the business. You got to make the thing work. You're not providing your return on value. You have to go. I need to replace you with someone who will. This is just common sense, but it's also justice in this context. And beyond that, it's theological fulfillment. There's something so much bigger going on here that Jesus is pointing to. And that is the whole grand redemptive plan of God. He's referencing Psalm 118 22. In Psalm 118, we're talking about Israel's king who was rejected, but it turned out to be the one who could defeat the enemies and make things right in Israel and all credit for this goes to the Lord. And Jesus just straight up coops the language and applies it to himself, which I guess everybody in town has agreed that he can do because he is affirmed by all of them as a prophet. I think it is very satisfying that in this firing, we're getting a payoff looking backwards to what John the Baptist said back in chapter three about the acts being at the root of the tree. And there's a reckoning. There's a judgment that's going to come. This has not been fruitful. Bad trees bear bad fruit. This warning has been percolating for a very long time. There's a payoff of vindication for John the Baptist, but then there's forward payoff that happens here narratively a few chapters down the road and something you and I were talking about a couple of days ago in Acts chapter four. Remember the whole thing from earlier in chapter 21 of Matthew where we had the question about the prayer thing, like the power of God and you can move mountains and you can speak to this stuff. And if you pray these things, then do whatever you ask for in prayer and we talked about how well, at least on the very metaphorical level, one of those mountains that would have come to mind was the establishment, the unmovable, unbreakable religious establishment. How is this tiny little movement? How are these followers of this guy who's about to get executed going to move that mountain and toss it into the sea? How are these followers going to be a part of bringing judgment to the unfruitful fig tree? Well, when we talked about that, we looked at acts for and it was like, well, they do. They go right into the Sanhedrin, right into the religious leadership and following in the footsteps of Jesus, they denounce the evil that has been going on. They call out the fruitlessness that is the product of this religious administration. And further, Peter, who has this knack moving forward in the Bible for trying to remember things Jesus did and then imitate it and do it just like that, he goes right back to Psalm 118 as well and in calling out the religious leadership for their hypocrisy and for the murder of Jesus, he tells them the stone you builders rejected has become the capstone. And so what we're seeing is all of these loose ends, all of these themes, all of these motifs paying off at once in this firing moment. The religious leaders come to Jesus and they're like, got you, we got a question you can't answer. You're in so much trouble. And he's like, okay, well, answer me this question. Oh, crap, we can't answer that question. Now we look like idiots. Yeah, we can't answer that one. Okay, cool. I'm not going to answer yours either. But also, as long as we're here, I had some things I wanted to talk to you about. Let's start small, which one of these two sons did the right thing, the one that said he wouldn't work, but then did or the one that said he would work and then didn't? Yeah, obviously it's the one who actually did the work. Hmm. Well, you're the one who didn't. You know, since I've got you here, let me take it a step further. Here's a story of a complete and total moral outrage. Hey, guys, guess which character you religious leaders are in this story? Yeah, you're the murderers and the failed tenants. What do you think's going to happen to them? Yeah, you're right. They're going to get replaced. Likewise, you are fired and you're going to be replaced with something else. What exactly does that look like? We got a big important chunk of Bible that is going to shed some light on that coming right down the pike and we'll be to that soon. Thanks to everybody supports the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. Golly, I like you. Thank you for making it so that we can just do this thing bravely and honestly and candidly and maybe funnily. That didn't work as well as an adverb. You have in my back and making this kind of the Internet happen. It just means the world to me. You're awesome. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon. vanilla", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.84, "text": " I've got a buddy who runs a business.", "tokens": [314, 1053, 1392, 257, 24407, 508, 4539,
