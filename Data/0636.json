This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and I know you got a trillion things going on in your life and yet here you are making time to hang out with me and work through Matthew and I think that's pretty cool. So thanks for doing that. We are talking about the religious leaders who are working on this sly plot to arrest Jesus and get the results they want, which is him out of the picture without having to actually really put their necks on the line because they're not sure how people are going to respond. Like, I don't really know if you're going to be down with this or not. So I kind of want to play it all sneaky like until I get a sense of how well it's going to work out and whether or not you're going to be mad. So we all know this human behavior. We've probably all engaged in this human behavior at some point or another. But I've been thinking about the religious leaders themselves and wondering what was going on inside their heads where they just completely unified when they're getting together to meet with Caiaphas, the high priest at his fancy palace where they just completely unified in their thoughts and being like, yeah, we're still, we just got to kill this guy. There's no other option. We tried everything and he's got to go and who cares what moral compromises we're making right now. Blood, blood, blood, we have to or we're some of the things that Jesus had said and done getting through the armor for these guys and making them feel kind of conflicted. And like, I kind of have to go along with this, I think by merit of some oaths I took or like a check that I cashed. But golly Jesus is pretty compelling. Like, if he's not the Messiah, I wonder what the Messiah would look like. Let's just think for a minute about what that conflictedness might have looked like if it existed. Like deep down at the level of the heart, surely all but the most ideologically locked in at least considered the possibility that Jesus was who it looked like he was. And in support of this, I would just throw out all of the ways that Jesus so obviously was positioned to be the fulfillment of things that were set up and just hanging out there from the Old Testament, from the Scriptures as they knew it at the time. He is increasingly looking like he's the fulfillment, the completion of the Passover here during Passover week over in John, John 2, I think I'm going all the way back to high school to remember that. I think behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. That's John 2, right? It's something like that. I mean, he's the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. It's Passover week. Did some of these religious leaders deep down consider that Jesus might have been the completion that don't to the bat, don't, don't that was just hanging out there from the Old Testament. It was the entire sacrificial system. Those sheep that got sacrificed, the goats got sacrificed in the Old Testament, like, come on, they didn't solve human depravity and brokenness and the fallenness of the world. Stuff stayed broken and depraved and fallen. It was obviously set up to illustrate something, to point to something that was coming in the future, to demonstrate a temporary staying of the righteous wrath and judgment of God. All of that sacrificial system that these religious leaders were purveyors in was a setup. It begged for completion later on. Jesus said, don't think I've come to abolish the law and the prophets. I didn't come to abolish them. I came to fulfill them. He said that with religious leaders sitting there, right with them. I mean, they heard what he said. They reported it back. Would they have wondered if indeed he was the Lamb of God who comes to take away the sins of the world once and for all completely? It's the feast of unleavened bread. The same week, would any of them have considered the imagery? Did they have to write like little sermons or something and in the process of sitting there and banging it out to meet a deadline where they may be like, huh, that unleavened bread, it's bread. It doesn't have yeast. It's, huh, yeast is like sin. It's like, would some of these religious leaders have reflected on that imagery and then thought about what they heard that Jesus has said that's written down in John 635, where he's like, I'm the bread of life, the bread of life. The imagery seems to overlap and the manna and the desert and all of that stuff. Is it possible that the whole Old Testament is pointing toward this guy who were plotting to murder? Is it possible that some of them secretly started to look at the impotence and flailing and position of weakness and just how compromised the role of the high priest was? I mean, quietly, did they think to themselves, I mean, the high priest is not even really a Levite anymore. It's just, this is a political stool pigeon appointed by Rome. The process isn't even right. This thing's a farce. The emperor has no clothes. How long is it going to be before everybody figures this out? It seems like Jesus keeps like actually what the high priest is supposed to be. This go between this mediator, between God and men. And as you and I talked about a little bit and a few conversations ago, this is, it's not hinted at heavily in Hebrews, like the whole middle chunk of Hebrews, like really the whole book of Hebrews is advancing the idea that, yeah, Jesus is the actual high priest. This is what it actually looks like. He is the fulfillment and the completion of that role. And when you contrast it with the impotence of that role of high priest that we see in the final years leading up to the destruction of the temple in 70 AD, you can see that Jesus is in the truest, realist, most eternal going all the way back to the beginning sense, even before all of the Levite and Levitical stuff. He's what this is actually supposed to look like. Is it possible that some of these religious leaders who were even in these meetings plotting his death were deep down like, maybe somebody should be plotting our death. What are we doing? This seems like it could actually be the guy we've been waiting for a completion of all of our stuff. We've been waiting for a deliverer and Jesus of Nazareth isn't what that looks like. What does it look like? I don't know. Maybe maybe not. Maybe every single person who went to every one of these meetings just had angry eyebrows that went down in the middle and they were as unsophisticated and unflinching in their thought loyalty as you could possibly hope for. They never had a second thought or doubt in any way about anything that they were doing. They were convinced of the righteousness of their cause, even if required scheming and deception and lying and an illegal arrest and false trumped up charges and effectively murder by proxy. Maybe it never occurred to them that doing all those things would make them the bad guy and maybe it never occurred to them that Jesus did the exact opposite of all of that stuff. Maybe it never occurred to them that the fruit that was produced by all of their scheming and religious leadership was murderous and illegal, rooted in lies and bribery, and maybe it never occurred to them that all of the stuff that Jesus was doing was rooted in the values of this kingdom that look a lot like the character of the God they say they theoretically believed. Or maybe there was some deep internal conflicting and the power of the institution and the power of the sunk cost fallacy in the heart of human beings was too much for some of these guys to overcome even though they knew they were probably in the wrong all the way up to and through the act of arresting, trying, falsely convicting and executing Jesus because that's what's coming. Why have the case? A little bit closer look at the text makes it super clear that Jesus isn't the driver seat here. He's the one in the position of power. And if he ends up getting arrested, if he ends up going through some trial at a kangaroo court, if he ends up getting executed by the state, it's looking more and more like that happened because he was up for it that he walked right into the trap knowing exactly what was going to happen because he's playing some different game than what everybody else is playing here. And that has some pretty exciting implications. That seems like a good place to land the plane on this passage. The next passage in Matthew 26 gives us a change of pace that I think will be interesting as well. All right. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
