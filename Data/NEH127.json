I've been thinking about it. I bought a TV, just a little monitor to do work on a while back. And I had to sign all these terms of service to get it. I bought a game where you go to Mad Max Planet in space and you shoot like mean mutant monsters and stuff. I had to accept the terms of, I had to make a contract with them that I had to agree to with my name. The name that was handed down to me by my ancestors who carefully cared for it and curated it through the generation so that now I would have it. The name that I currently bear the torch of for better or for worse, the name I will hand off. I had to put that name on my agreement to play a space video game where I shoot purple plasma guns, space monsters. That's a lot of terms of service contracting that I have done. And it's starting to catch up with me and I'm starting to not feel real good about it. But it's not just me. I mean, this is how society is at this point. We are overly litigious. So much complexity goes into the contract making that we do that no one knows what they're obligated to. Probably because of the way we write laws and the way we write contracts. Every single one of us is living in a state of perpetual guilt before the government. That if at any given point, it made sense for them to call in that guilt they could. And also every single one of us is living in probably some state of perpetual breach of contract with thousands of people and companies. We don't even remember making a contract with, but we just wanted to play a game where monkeys pop balloons. And so I just clicked some stuff and I guess now I'm somehow in breach of contract with you or something. This is a weird way to live. And it's a weird way to think about your name. It's a weird way to think about your honor and your word. And look, I'm not saying I've always handled my honor and my name and my word perfectly. I've not. I've regrets like everybody has regrets. But when it comes to all the contracts I've made, I don't even know what I've done wrong because I don't even know what I signed. That's weird. Contracts used to be much simpler. We see that in the Bible. The idea of a business contract. It's usually pretty simple when you encounter something alluding to that in the Bible. The kind of contracts that we have on record from back in this time. Remember, we've got bajillions of carved clay shard contracts from Persian archives that we've dug up. We only know what a small fraction of them even say there's that many that we haven't even had time to go through all of them yet. But the time that it takes to go through them is because there are so many, not because they're so complex. They're very simple when you see them. Party A will deliver party B this much grain in exchange for this much thing. It's really basically it. Maybe there's one more clause for what happens if one party or the other doesn't do it. Usually that's how ancient contracts work. You have a positive clause. You have a negative clause. Now our contracts. I don't even know what the clauses are. There's so many stipulations and weird things that are beyond the comprehension of any normal person. So where do we see those simple contracts make their way forward into life today? I do think we still see it in a couple of places. One is the very basic of exchange. I go to a lemonade stand. It's a buck for a thing, a lemonade. I give them a buck. They give me the lemonade. We didn't make a contract, but we made a deal. We have an accord. You sell your car on Facebook for $3,000. They give you $3,000. You write a bill of sale on a sheet of white paper. This is I sold my car to so-and-so. Here's the VIN number. It was $3,000. They take the vehicle. You take the money. You give them the title. It's just over. It's that simple. The place where I think we most see a deal articulated the way it was in the ancient world, the way it was in the time of Nehemiah is when you go to a wedding. Weddings are the place where the ancient idea, not just of the contract, I guess there's a contract involved, but where the ancient idea of a covenant lives on. As I'm recording this, I'm a couple of days away from performing a wedding for two people I care about very much. I'm so excited about this. They're a great match. This is going to be a great thing. I think they're going to have amazing kids someday. I think they're going to be great parents. I'm just super, super honored to get to be a part of this thing, to put my blessing and stamp of approval on it, to officiate the ceremony, the covenant ceremony. But whenever I do a wedding, which is one of my favorite things that I get to do in life, I spend a lot of time with the couple beforehand. Talking about all the things that go with marriage and trying to set them up for success and helping them ask good questions of each other and have expectations that both parties know and all of that stuff. One of the things we talk about a ton is just the nature of a covenant. Hey, so you guys know this ceremony we do, this is binding. This is real. When you say I do and I make the declaration, that is when you become married. Now after that, we'll sign some paperwork or something and we'll register that with the government and that has a formalizing effect with them. But at the wedding, all the people in your life effectively just signed off on this. You just went public. You are now married as we think of married in this context before God and before witnesses and these promises made before each other. And most specifically, I tell them you are married because you will have completed this covenant. So how is a covenant different than all of the cheapo disposable contracts that we sign in life right now? Well, the contracts for starters are impenetrable. You can't know what they all say. It's too verbose. It's too complicated. It's meant to be complicated. That's intentional. It's meant to protect the person who issued the contract and offers the service and none of those contracts you're signing are meant to protect you in any way. That's why they're impenetrable. A covenant like marriage in the example we're talking about is meant to be understandable. It's meant to be the kind of thing that child, adults, old person, anybody sitting there who speaks the language, the service is being carried out in and maybe even somebody who doesn't can understand exactly what the promises being exchanged are. It's why I don't do made up vows. I'm sure that lots of people can write great made up vows and I'm sure they're very sincere and beautiful. But what I've found is that when couples want to do their own vows and they want to write them, they skip all the part that's actually the promises they need to make to each other that are the actual terms of the covenant they're entering into. They tend to just say really nice things about each other and about love and stuff like that. It's beautiful. So somebody wants to do that. I just have them do that separately, but it doesn't count as the vows. Now we do the traditional vows. What are those? I so and so take you so and so to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, richer, poorer sickness, health. I promise to be faithful to you until death parts us. Okay. All the components are right in there. Everybody can get what that means. Everybody knows the deal they just made when they both say this to each other. And then I like to do the ring vow as well when I have one side the ring onto the other's finger. And that is with this ring, IV wed where it always is a symbol of our love and affection. And by the time we get to that point, we're at the more or less the end of the ceremony, the parents, you know, living parents, parents who are in people's lives. They've been honored. They've walked in. I'm very into the dad walks the bride down the aisle. If that is a feasible option and dad stands there with his daughter and I ask the question who's here to give this woman away in marriage. And then he answers as his appropriate, his mother and I or whatever makes sense given their circumstances. But if possible, he's there. And then I like to have him literally take his daughter's hand and place it in the hand of the groom. So we've covered all of that. The family is signing off on this. The witnesses are signing off on this. There's four or five people up there who've known the couple, helped them get to where they're going. They're standing up there, fanned out in a way that displays all the relationships that are in play here. Everyone is buying into this. What we've come to when we get to the vows is everybody's vouching. Everybody's saying, this is a good idea and I support it. I'm willing to be here for this, even stand up for this. Also all of the relevant parties just heard those promises and they're going to support this couple through good times and bad. Richard Pore, sickness, health, all of that stuff with these vows, which can be difficult over the long haul of life. So everyone understands what we're going for. Everyone is signing off on this. We've exchanged the very intentional, specific, timeless vows. We've exchanged a token of that love. And then if I'm officiating the thing, I will say something to the effect of because of the work of God in your life, because of the provision and the grace of God and because of the promises you have made here today is my great privilege to now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss your bride. And then I introduce the couple by name. I'm not saying that I do weddings exactly the right way or there's only one way to do it. What I'm saying is, do you see how markedly different the intentionality and meaning of that is versus I was pooping and I downloaded an app and I had to scroll to the bottom and click a thing because it wouldn't let me click accept because that was great out until I clicked that box that said I agreed to all of your terms. They're just nothing alike. A covenant feels like a very foreign concept to you and me as we live in the age of litigious verbose, stupid contract and law writing, but it is still a concept that we can conceive of because we see it in marriage, maybe a few other places in life as well. And we understand that a covenant is witnessed by a group of people. We're all buying into this. We all think it's a good idea. We're all here. We're sealing this together by standing up and saying, we vouch for this. We're making oaths before God and before each other. It is binding for time and there is a positive thing. This is what we are trying to do. This is what we're going for. This is what I promise to you. I am dying to self. I am voluntarily laying down a whole bunch of my rights because I would rather hand those off to you and live in mutual submission to you, the person I love and share life together. And we're going to use visuals and we're going to use all kinds of cues and ritual to make it clear. This is when the thing happened and it's real and everybody who wanted to complain about it had a chance to work through that. Everyone was given notice. It's even registered with the government in many countries. This is binding. This is real. This is a covenant. It's a public covenant and it will change the course of this family and it will change the course of history. It is a very big deal. Why are we talking about all of this stuff today? Well, it's to set up what we're going to do for the next few days as we work through the rest of Nehemiah chapter 10. It will be tempting for you and I who live in the age of terms of service style contracts and in the age of laws so gigantic that you have to pass it to find out what's in it for us to picture contract when we look at this next business in the book of Nehemiah. When the thing that's more akin to what we're looking at here is wedding, something that is generationally binding, something that changes not even just the course of life for the two individuals making the promise but that has an extended effect to the family, to the household and through time moving forward. That is the kind of stuff that all of those people who I ever so carefully listed off yesterday, that is the kind of thing that they are about to seal, not a cheap terms of service deal and we'll look at the specifics of what that covenant is like next time around. Hey, it's been great hearing back from a bunch of you who have received the last mailing that we sent out to everybody who supports the podcast at any level on any platform. We're still working on the next wave of that for people to kind of sign up right on the tail end of it. We have not forgotten you. That will come through international always takes a little longer as well, but that's on the way. What you should receive in that is a Galatians notebook, a little note from me and you should get your Nehemiah sticker as well. We got kids and stuff involved. We're trying to make all of that happen in the middle of a move. So I am sure we screwed up somebody's if that's a case, shoot me an email. We'll bounce you something right out and get it taken care of straight away. If you got missed on any of that stuff that should have been in there. Thank you again so much for being a part of this thing. Thanks to everybody who supports it as well. It means the world. All right. I'm at the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
