Small town rural Oklahoma means something very different than Paris, France and Paris, France in 2021 means something very different than Paris, France in the 13th century locations carry meanings they carry stories with them and sometimes that location has enough history enough meaning built into it either in fiction or in history that the mere mention of that and understanding all of that swirling whirlwind of stories and meanings that surround that location that can help you understand what the characters are thinking what it would have meant to an original audience and I think what we are looking at in Matthew chapter 21 definitely falls into that category. You got this little village of Bethany they get just a passing mention here in Matthew chapter 21 after Jesus cleanses the temple and has an uncomfortable exchange with the religious leadership he bails at a Jerusalem which is swollen with travelers right now much like Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska the third biggest city in the state on game day and so Jesus is not going to stay in Jerusalem he's staying out of town but is that just because space was hard to come by or does it mean something like at the very beginning of Jesus life space was hard to come by and he ended up staying with his family on his first night in the manger and some cave somewhere some stable somewhere in Bethlehem again just outside of Jerusalem but why was that was just because of crowding or did it mean something well obviously come on you've done Christmas it means something it matters it communicates a point to the original audience through the audience through the ages it matters for his ticking of boxes of the messianic predictions surrounding him and what I'm trying to argue here is that I think Bethany means something and I think it's more than just things were crowded and this is where the overflow traffic went I think this means something so what do we know about Bethany well from outside the Bible we know that Bethany dates to a few hundred years before the time of Jesus maybe as many as five to six hundred years before the time of Christ we know it was not big we're not a hundred percent exactly sure which teeny tiny little set of foundations that have been built on top of over the centuries is definitely Bethany but we got a pretty decent guess because some important Bible stuff happened in Bethany and as a result over the first few centuries after the time of the New Testament pilgrims and local Christians would go to these important sites and they would either find using cultural memory or basic research the exact location where a thing happened we feel pretty good for example about the location of the sermon on the Mount near Capernaum or they would go to a place that fits the description and seems like well that would probably be the place where it happened even though there wasn't a ton of evidence or cultural memory there as is the case of the tomb in Bethany where Lazarus was purported to have been buried for well just a little while in John chapter 11 more on that in just a minute based on the location of that particular cave that shrine where churches were built is a decent chance that we have a clear sense of exactly precisely where Bethany is to this day and where Bethany is to this day seems to line up pretty directly with what we get in John 11 I found it John 11 18 it says Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem assuming we are talking about the right historical location and as I mentioned the evidence seems to point that way it means that Bethany is just on the other side of the Mount of Olives from Jerusalem so way back in the day better part of two miles 1.71 miles is what I think the estimate I read was that's far enough to be two distinct communities maybe by the time we get to Jerusalem this is functioning more like a suburb but some historians and Bible scholars theorize that Jerusalem might not have grown right in around Bethany like a normal big city would with a little suburb or bedroom community on the edge of it and the reason for that is because of some theories about why Bethany might have existed what role that it served now there's debate about whether Bethany is best understood as being a Hebrew name in two parts or an Aramaic name in two parts or some sort of hybrid of these two languages the time frame that Bethany came to even mild prominence during would make it possible that either of those explanations work but there's some hint buried in the name there that suggested this might have been a place where the sick were gathered some people theorize that the Essenes sent their lepers and their sick to Bethany to receive care or just to live out their days I've read the credible suggestion that this was a place where people could go to do their required charity and if this indeed was a place where you could go to do your charity to pay your alms or your donations that would mean that there would be people there who were in need and so it is possible the Bethany is a place where people went to die people went for what we would call in a modern sense hospice care it would also mean that Bethany would have to be separated from all other dwellings by what was it like 600 feet at least 600 feet I think was the required amount for cleanliness purposes if you put lepers in there you can't have other people close because of medicinal common sense as well as the regulations laid down in the Old Testament for clean and unclean and the civil laws regarding what you do with people who have certain afflictions of the skin so that would mean that Bethany was a place of mercy but Bethany was also a place where you got to be really careful if you trot in there for a little while because you could very easily come away unclean and it could have a reputation as a place where you maybe want to stop by as a tourist with your 10 foot social distancing poles going in all directions but you wouldn't want to stay there set up shop especially during Passover week because of the risk of you becoming unclean and not getting to participate in all of the religious elements of the Passover because you got too close to the wrong person or touch the wrong surface or interact with somebody the wrong way and now you're rich will be unclean I mean that risk would be huge so it might just be that Bethany was a place that had plenty of lodging because it just wasn't somewhere that you would want to go all of this is a little bit speculative but without getting into every single thing there's good reason to believe all of this stuff and some of that good reason just has to do with even stuff we see in the Bible I referenced John 11 a little bit earlier and John 11 as we all might remember from Sunday school has the claim to fame of having the shortest verse in the Bible that's the one John 11 35 Jesus wept wise he weeping well because somebody loves Lazarus has died and he's died in Bethany and Mary and Martha those are the sisters of Lazarus they send word to Jesus and they're like oh Lazarus sick come on Jesus like I'm doing something he gets there but he gets there later than they wanted him to get there and they're like I have you been here you could have saved him and Jesus like no he he will rise again and Martha's like I know he will on the last day at the resurrection and Jesus makes one of his big famous seven I am God proclamation statements that he makes in the book of John right at this point where he famously says I am the resurrection and the life and whoever lives and believes in me will never die and then he asks her do you believe this and she's like yes I do believe this and then Jesus calls for Lazarus like raises a dude from the dead demonstrates that he has authority even over death if this miracle happened in a place that was set aside a place that meant dignified death and the opportunity for the living to lightly interact with that to remind themselves of where they are headed and to do something merciful toward those who are headed in that direction more quickly then the meaning becomes even more significant a place associated with death sickness and all the things that are broken about the body and humanity becomes associated with life and the defeating of death. John arranges Jesus raising of Lazarus from the dead and another visit to Beth and he right next to each other in chapters 11 and 12 but it looks like John is skipping a bunch of details that happened in between there Matthew has Jesus going during the passion week here a few chapters down the road that we'll go and look at back out to Bethany where he's staying during this whole week and he's at the house of a guy named Simon the leper that is in keeping with all the stuff that we were just talking about in terms of what Bethany means as a place and there is the famous anecdote where Mary anoints him with oil and there's some controversy about the cost of all of that and I guess ever going to get to that more down the road here. But the fact that the next time Bethany comes up it is in the context of again someone who is or was unclean and Jesus being there freely instead of in the much more fancy definitely clean swanky downtown Jerusalem during Passover festival season thing all of that means stuff and that really is just my entire point today. Thank you for talking about history and geography and ancient culture and things like this with me. I really like these kind of episodes and I'm always nervous. I'm always like oh I hope people are bored because of all of that stuff and then whenever I say that a whole bunch of you're like what no that's fun go ahead and do it. So I'm taking you up on that. Thank you for engaging with me on that stuff I think it's a blast we'll move forward in the narrative on Matthew 21 next time around. I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
