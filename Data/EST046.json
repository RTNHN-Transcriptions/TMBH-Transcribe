And right now, we're going through Esther. Mark my words, dear listeners. If you want to get something done, there's only one way to do it. And that is to have a meeting. These meetings is where people meet and get together to talk about things and have discussions. And it basically is action in and of itself. Well, Xerxes finds himself in a situation here in Esther chapter one. And it's a situation where he was having a meeting and then something went wrong in his opinion at that meeting. So he needed to have another meeting to fix the problem with the previous meeting. Here's what occurred. His queen was hosting a party for a bunch of women. Well, Xerxes was hosting a party for a bunch of men. Apparently, everybody was allowed to drink however much they wanted, whatever the normal royal cap on the amount of wine that we're having at a party is it was lifted. We're not doing any of that business drink like crazy and his stuff gets super crazy. Xerxes gets a wild idea to have his queen, a woman named Vashti trotted in in front of the men. And she's supposed to show off her beauty. Now look, in the last couple of conversations, I have looked at that and said, it's clearly a euphemism. What is meant by show off her beauty means just where that crown it will be enough and display your beauty in a way that is sexual. Some other people in fairness over the years have looked at that passage and said that he really just meant beauty. I've heard it suggested that the reason that the royal eunuchs were summoned on the seventh day when King Xerxes Esther 110 was in high spirits from wine. He commanded the seven eunuchs who served him list all their names to bring before him queen Vashti wearing her royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles for she was lovely to look at. And I look, I imagine the what he wanted here was some sort of lewd presentation, some sort of provocative dance, something like that. I imagine that was already going on with all kinds of servant girls and other things in this kind of environment from things that I've read extra biblically about what life was like in these Persian courts at this time. But I could be wrong. Maybe what Xerxes wanted was for those guys to grab the royal litter, you know, that thing that people back then they put on their shoulders and they give somebody a ride, a queen would get to ride on that. So maybe they were supposed to bring her in and just like walk her around and present her while she was resting attractively on that litter. It could be. I've heard very smart people suggest that. And if that interpretation is right, does it reframe the question of how we should view Vashti? This isn't what this episode is going to be about. And I'm just thinking about this as we go in real time here. I don't know. A lot of people over the centuries, including Martin Luther, they thought Vashti was a model of horrible wifiness, really getting things wrong, disrespecting your husband, not understanding his office as king or as head of the household. And so there's a lot of people who have argued that Vashti should have done what her husband said here. And before we go just shredding those people and dismissing them entirely as misogynists or awful people from the past before we say, this is why we can't have nice things. I have to imagine that people who have made that argument over the centuries. Well, one, I know they're arguing that in a totally different cultural context than our own. But two, I would have to imagine that they are picturing a rather innocent request on the part of Xerxes. Like there's going to be a parade. You're going to ride in the royal litter. You shall be carried for one lap. You shall wave at all of the men who are here. They shall wave back. Then you shall go to your party. And if that's the request, okay, is still not my favorite thing, but that probably would fall in line with expected royal duties of a queen from time to time. It's just that I don't think that's what was going on here. I don't think that Xerxes was some sort of innocent fellow and that these folks were innocent and prudish. I think this thing got pretty lewd. And I think that's what you would expect from this kind of unchecked power at this level. So I think crazy stuff happened here. I mean, for crying out loud, it doesn't matter what party in my country you like. If you go and do a little googling on what your preferred political party has done at the highest levels of leadership in the last 20 or 30 years in terms of certain sexual things, you'll find some pretty messed up stuff. Power tends to lend itself to these kind of abuses. And that's before we even get into some of the allegations floating around about certain cultural elites over the last 10 or 20 years and the horrifying activities they are accused of even though for whatever reason, we can't seem to get that sorted out in our judicial system and actually deal with or punish those abuses, which continues to just make me scratch my head. Now, power tends to lend itself to sexual expressions of power historically. And so I don't buy the innocent explanation for what is going on here. I think Xerxes wanted to do something exploitative. I think he wanted to show off for the boys. And so I'm team Vashti on this one. I respect her decision as I talked about last time around. I imagine once again that people historically who have argued that she was in the wrong are imagining a very different request than the one I am reading between the lines and seeing here on this page. Whatever the case, let's get back to this meeting. So Xerxes, whether it's fair or not or right or not, he has been insulted. He has been refused in front of his homies and he is not going to take that. And so he gets a little mini meeting that happens inside the larger meeting that he was just having, which was in conclusion and follow up to the much larger meeting he was having before that. And in a sense, isn't all of government meeting. So it's like a meeting within a meeting within a meeting within a meeting. Within a meeting. And in this meeting, he invites his seven most trusted counselors. And if you were with me through the whole history culture run up to our journey through the book of Esther, this is going to ring a bell for you. All right. Esther 1 13, Vashti just said, no, then the king became furious and he burned with anger. And then it says this, since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matter of the law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times and were closest to the king. Arshana, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Mary's, Marcenta and Memokan, the seven nobles of Persia and media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom. These guys have got to be descended from the co-conspirators who worked with Darius to put him on the throne and eliminate Bardia, the son of Cyrus, right? You remember the deal? Ambai sees the second, the older brother of Bardia, the oldest son of Cyrus, the great. He's off doing some campaign and he injures himself, nicks himself on his lance and it goes gangreness or something and he dies. And then immediately Darius and a total of seven co-conspirators ride as hard as they can across the whole known world all the way back to go and find the younger son of Cyrus, the great, the younger brother of King Cambyses, the second who just died and kill him. And then they make up a story about how he was actually a shapeshifter and they're just doing everybody a favor. And the seven co-conspirators come up with some kooky plan to pick who will be the next king and they pick Darius and Darius literally etches this narrative in stone on the face of a mountain. And if you recall, both in the stone and from other extra biblical sources, we learn that those co-conspirators were granted infinite access to the king. That was part of their price. They get to just walk in unless of course he's with a woman. That's one of the deals. They get to walk in whenever they want without going through all of the royal formalities that any other high ranking noble person would have to go to. And you will recall there was an incident with one of those co-conspirators into Fernes who violated the rule of you don't get to approach the king. If his attendants say he's with a woman and the result was that Darius went super goblin mode on him and punished him and his family and kind of rattled this whole special deal that was supposed to be handed down where certain advisors or descendants rather of these seven families would be permitted to maintain this special access because of force everybody else if you approach the king inappropriately, you just die. You just get put to death. So I got to think these guys are generation two of that conspiratorial bunch or they're somehow descended from that group. And it's kind of interesting because these seven guys who have a special arrangement about going before the king are getting together to debate the punishment for someone who refused to go before the king. So to them it's this great special privilege that they can go whenever they want and they're debating the fate of someone who was invited and refused to go before the king. Interesting irony. Now what we're going to see next time around is that it's probably good that Xerxes didn't have more advisors because these seven guys are able to spin him around and give him suggestions and tell the king of kings how things ought to be very quickly and very efficiently and Xerxes is happy to swallow that wholesale and just repeat and parrot everything they say to do. But as I said, we're going to have to look at that one next time around. Grace and peace to everybody. Thanks for thinking about sometimes difficult things with me.
