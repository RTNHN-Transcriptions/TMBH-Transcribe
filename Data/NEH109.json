Have you ever been to a music festival, like the hippie kind of music festival that happens out in the woods or in the field somewhere? I went to one for a while. It was called Cornerstone. I don't remember how many years I attended. I was never really super into the whole Christian music thing. I know some people like it. It's fine. It's just the Christian pop, Christian rock thing. I don't know. It didn't always resonate with me. There were some exceptions. There were a few bands at this event called Cornerstone and my friends were going. It was enough that I wanted to go and try it out. It was a pretty fun time when I attended. The whole thing was this giant tent fort city. Everyone lived like hippies out in the middle of nowhere in this field in Illinois. There were a bunch of stages and bands came in and performed. It really was a pretty fun event. I don't know that they put that on anymore. You hear about these things going horribly wrong to what was it? Woodstock 99? There was some year where they tried to redo woodstock and it was a complete and total disaster, like a human crisis kind of situation. But I think for the most part, they throw together these music festivals or whatever out in the field. They bring in a bunch of porta-potties and bands and everybody has a pretty nice time and it's pretty cool. But usually the people who go to these things are kids. It's people who are in a phase in life where dignity isn't quite as important and they're looking for the wild adventure and they don't mind the inconvenience and the mess and all of that. That's part of the charm of the whole thing. At least that was my experience when I went to some of these. You don't imagine the elites of culture and the leaders being out there and their little $75 Walmart tent doing this thing. That's kind of what sets apart in my mind. The imagery that I have when I picture this feast of booths that were having described to us in Nehemiah chapter 8. It really is pretty wild the way chapter 8 unfolds because you've got this great big response, the spontaneous-ish gathering at the water gate, the walls are built, the gates are hung, everybody's celebrating and they're like, bring out the book of the law. We want to hear about that thing. Read it to us. They're all real excited about it and they hear from the book of the law and all of a sudden everybody starts crying as the Levites go out into the crowd and explain to the people specifically or rather in terms that they can understand what's being said from the front with the book of the law. Apparently the explanation is so good that people start having an emotional reaction as one little pocket at a time. They realize who God is and what the law is and what the ancient story that they're a part of is and they realize, whoa, I'm not doing that at all. I didn't understand this. I wasn't doing it or maybe I did understand it. I wasn't doing it either way. They realized I wasn't doing it. This is a big emotional thing. But then Nehemiah and Ezra and the Levites, all of them start saying like, whoa, hold on. It's not a time to cry. It's not a time to weep. This is a sacred day. You know, don't have to grieve right now. In fact, Nehemiah says, now I should not be grieving, but go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks and give them to people who don't have enough money to enjoy those. This should be a time of celebration. Well, two reasons that we're having a celebration. One, because the wall is done and it sort of locks in a hundred year repatriation, rebuilding effort to get the descendants of Abraham back on their feet in Jerusalem. But the second reason that we're celebrating is because there is this renewal of the covenant and this renewed excitement for the law of God and for knowing God and following God. And in the course of re-familiarizing themselves with the law in this very public event, they stumble across the Feast of Booths, the Feast of Tabernacles and they learn from Leviticus 23 that this is an actual thing. It's like you build a tent city like they would do in a music festival, but there's no stages or bands and probably not a lot of drugs. And even the dignified people go and build these huts. Every household is supposed to do it. You take the wood that you go and gather from out on the countryside and you come back and you set up this little temporary dwelling and the inconvenience of it is part of the charm, the inconvenience of it is part of the reminder of this dramatic time where God led their ancestors through the desert and out of Egypt. And it's really fascinating timing that the Feast of Booths is what's going on here in what would be for us the fall of September and into October of 444 BC because really it caps off this whole parallel moment in the history of the Jewish people between the return from exile in Nehemiah and the escape from slavery back in Egypt in both situations. They fall under the sway, under the power of the greatest and most powerful nation on earth. In both of those situations, there's a moment where a prominent descendant of Abraham becomes powerful and influential even at the right hand of the king. I think of Joseph back in the day, Moses raised in Pharaoh's household and then you fast forward 800 years to the stuff we've been looking at here in the age of Persia and you've got Mordecai and Esther and you've got Nehemiah, cut bearer to the king. But also these two empires, Egypt way back in the day and Persia now, they're both kind of, you know, they're bulls in a China shop. They're big and gigantic and clumsy and if you accidentally get in the way, then those do huge damage to you bureaucratically without even really noticing because they're so big and they're so dangerous. And in both cases, the bureaucratic state turns on the Jewish people and they find themselves in danger of being wiped out, extinctified even. And then something miraculous or providential from God happens and there's a deliverance from that danger. You think of the deliverance from Haman, you think of the deliverance from Pharaoh with the Red Sea, those stories kind of rhyme a little bit. And then in both situations, there's a rebuilding process of going back to this land and defeating enemies there and becoming reestablished there and building there and also in both of these stories, there's a receiving of the law, there's a renewal of the covenant. And so celebrating something here on the back end of the September 27th, 444 BC event that is reminiscent that Harkins back to the events of the Exodus, it makes perfect sense. It's like poetry rhymes. It fits together beautifully. And so the people here about this in Leviticus 23 is that part gets read Nehemiah 814, they the people, the assembly found written in the law, which the Lord had commanded through Moses that the Israelites were to live in booths during the feast of the seventh month and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem. And it says, quote, go into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees and from mertals and palms and shade trees to make booths as it is written. So the whole thing is teed up beautifully for them to simply hear the thing, understand much like as Renee and I have done so well all along, where they fit into this great big grand story and simply go do their part, complete the rhyme, round it out, do the booth thing. Even if you don't totally get it, the payoff is going to be awesome. It's going to work. Verse 16. So they did. Okay, that was a paraphrase already. It actually says, so the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves booths on their own roofs and the courtyards and the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Watergate and the one by the gate of Ephraim and the whole company that had returned from exile, built booths and lived in them. Remember the beginning I was talking about that cornerstone festival, that kind of hippie music festival I went to back in the day and how it was a whole bunch of kids and people who would kind of find that sort of inconvenient living stylish. We went and we made our own little mud covered, disgusting, sweaty tent village out in a field in Illinois in the humidity in the summer. It's amazing. We listened to music is the most meaningful thing, but not a lot of cultural elites showed up. It was more of a, you know, people like me kind of event, not fancy people kind of event, but here it says the whole company that had returned from exile, built booths and lived in them. So presumably this, I mean, it says a whole company. This would include all of those fancy nobles who've been up and down and a little bit unpredictable. It would include the heads of households. It would include people who've got a few more years on them, a few more miles on the tires. Everybody, regardless of the supposed dignity of their social status among the returning exiles, everybody did it. They went out and they built the thing. This in and of itself is simultaneously fun. I mean, really, I think it's cool. I mean, it's fun and celebratory. We're camping. This is awesome. But it's also humbling. Some of these people had cool paneled houses in the style of the Persians. Some of these people remembered the wealth and the opulence of living in. Sousa or Persepolis or Babylon. And now they're out here making a tent for it in the square by the Watergate spontaneously. And not just setting it up and being like, that's fun. We made a hut, but living in it for a week. I think it really would have been quite the cool effect and a very memorable way to resurrect this mostly forgotten festival to very publicly proclaim. Here we all are. Then we just be beggars and huts if it weren't for the way that God had provided for us. I mean, there's just so many cool layers of meaning to this. I love the gesture. I love that everybody was involved. So the whole company that had returned from exile built the booths and lived in them from the days of Joshua, son of none until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. So going all the way back to that stuff that we were looking at together in Joshua 24 and the conquest of the land coming out of the desert wandering after the exodus. It's been that long. What did that would be? 800 ish years since those events, it hadn't been celebrated like this. This is the bestest celebration and no doubt everybody was absolutely miserable and angry and grumpy because they had to do it, but they just had to do it, right? Because that wouldn't be fun. We're camping grumble, grumble, the ground is hard. Nope. It says, and their joy was very great. That's awesome. They delighted in it. The fancy people, the little kids, everybody, it was just humbling, unifying, clarifying, remembering, commemorating thing. And it hadn't been like that for the better part of a thousand years. It's really cool. So the boring way to tell this story would be like they got tents and they made like little huts and they were in them for a while. The cool way is to think about it like we're thinking about it right now. This matters. This means something. It keeps going here. Verse 18, day after day from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the book of the law of God, they celebrated the feast for seven days and on the eighth day in accordance with the regulation there was an assembly. So they did it. They went through all the paces of this thing. They did it with joy. They did it with enthusiasm. Nobody was above it. Everybody participated. They ate good food. They shared with each other and they listened to the Bible a whole bunch. Ezra and the Levites worked their butts off, worked overtime, reading the thing and explaining the thing to people and presumably the people internalized it more and more and more. It was like they did a whole week of no work, no distractions. Everything was just this Bible festival where they got together and everybody, young and old, reflected on what God had done in the past, where they fit in the narrative, what the law of God actually says, what it reveals about his character and each day they're more and more understanding that and figuring out what it looks like to live in that, be a part of that story and committing themselves to it. Something about this stuck. There was something really meaningful about this year and this celebration, this resurrection of the Feast of Booths because you know what? After every other one of these great big celebrations or gatherings or covenant renewals that we see in the whole Old Testament, all these pages, you know what? The people went right back to idolatry. But even though it hasn't been perfect in Judaism ever since Nehemiah 8, they never went back to idolatry. Some things really did change some stuff that hadn't stuck before stuck. I think it's an amazing time. There's a lot of up and down, particularly a lot of down throughout the Old Testament. And I'm glad that today we got to envision something and remember something that was a huge win. And I think it's fun. Celebrate that. That's plenty for now. We got to do one last big picture look at this very important Nehemiah chapter 8 that we've spent so much time on. And then we'll get on into Nehemiah chapter 9 after that.
