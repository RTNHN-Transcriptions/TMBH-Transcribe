This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and I am recording this in real time for a Monday. So if you're listening to this as it's coming out, it's going to be a Monday for you. And I am not unaware of how Mondays can be. It takes a lot of emotional energy sometimes to get in the right head space for the week. And so you want positive things on a Monday morning, and we're going to do a gigantic prayer of regret. So it feels on the surface like this probably isn't going to be a good fit for your commute into work or your morning workout with your unitard, your sweat, drenched leopard print unitard that is starting to wear just a little bit then and people can maybe kind of see through it. You might want to investigate that. And you might think this just isn't for me. I'm going to listen to this another time, but I think it's going to be okay because I actually think that this prayer from Ezra in Ezra chapter nine represents not something super sad and horrible, but it represents the rebound point where he's gone through all the paces of figuring out what went wrong and why things are screwed up. He's grieved it. He's mourned the mistakes. But now he's going to go and verbally square accounts with God and express what he wants the game plan to be and ask for God's blessing in that. And as kind of works right when we screw things up to you. And I'm not even saying this is all as or his fault. And I don't think it really is. I think he inherited this mess from other people's bad decisions in this situation we've been reading about in the book of Ezra. But for you and me, I mean, sometimes we inherit other people's messes. Sometimes we make messes and let other people inherit them from us. But wherever the mess came from that moment of clarity and awareness, this is a situation I'm in. And this is how I got here. And this is who I need to square accounts with. And this is what the plan probably needs to look like moving forward. It's not a bad thing. It's a good thing. And some of the behavior, the character stuff that I've seen in life from people that has most impressed me has been how people have responded to stuff that went wrong. There's a real opportunity in that. And so I think this is a positive passage that we're getting here in Ezra chapter nine. And I'm just going to read it to you. So remember, Ezra has pulled out his beard. He's pulled out his hair. He's going to do this prayer with like a whole bunch of patches missing. He's in sackcloth. A bunch of people have gathered around him. Presumably they're going to hear this prayer. Also this poor dude just had a pins and needles pucker up kind of trip across a bandit infested road with a quarter of a billion dollars he was dragging around. Was that the number we landed at or was that Haman's number that he offered to Xerxes? Whatever. It's a ton of money and all of that stress, all of these concerns, he makes it to Jerusalem. He figures out that things are a mess and he's got his work cut out forms. He's sad. He's publicly grieved. He's made a show of it. People have gathered around and this is what happens next Ezra nine five. Then at the evening sacrifice, I rose from myself a basement with my tunic and cloak torn and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God and prayed. Oh my God, I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you my God because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt is reached to the heavens. From the days of our forefathers until now our guilt has been great because of our sins. We and our kings and our priests have been subject to the sword and captivity. To pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings as it is today. But now for a brief moment, the Lord our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary. And so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage. Though we are slaves, our God has not deserted us in our bondage. She's shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia. He's granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins. And he's given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem. But now, oh our God, what can we say after this? For we've disregarded the commands you gave through your servants, the prophets when you said the land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples by their detestable practices. They've filled it with their impurity from one end to the other. Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time that you may be strong and to eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance. What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt. And yet our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this. Shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? Oh Lord God of Israel, you are righteous. We are left this day as a remnant. We are before you in our guilt, though because of it, not one of us can stand in your presence. Effectively, this is what I get from the prayer. He's not throwing everybody else under the bus. That would be easy to do. Just lecture everyone else. But he views this as a covenant community sin. We all own this kind of stuff. There's no special deal in the covenant that we went back and looked at you and I in Exodus. It was made with Moses where it's like, wow, but if it's just, you know, some of you, then the blessings and curses, like I'll have to do it. No, it's a testimony to the nations. The nations don't know that 43% of you were into this thing and 43% weren't and 14% were undecided. They don't know. It's going to be a clear testimony of the nations. This is different than anything else that we know or think about in terms of political stuff or corporate responsibility for the well-being of the heart of the people, the heart of society. And so Ezra doesn't try to duck it at all. He says, this is our guilt. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it, not one of us can stand in your presence. I think our is the key word of the whole prayer. If you really think about it, right? I mean, you heard me kind of emphasizing it a little bit and being all dramatic back there. But what has happened to us as verse 13 is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt. And yet our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved. He had a lot of time to sit there with his beard yanked out and quietly think about exactly what he wanted to do in this prayer. And it is no accident that he is pounding the corporate nature of the situation that in part his prayer is almost a plea to the people who would be listening in to say, the only way to fix this is for us to come together and do a difficult thing and a difficult thing it is to unmake mistakes that are very, very hard to unmake as we discussed a while back. I'm struck by how humble this prayer is. I'm struck by how absolutely clear he is on what's wrong. And if you get to Ezra chapter nine on a straight read through of the Bible, probably some of you know what I'm talking about. Probably many of you do not. I know there are a lot of you who this is kind of your first rodeo with the Bible, which I mean, awesome. Welcome. I'm not sure if you've read it the other way, but those of you who've read through it before, you may be remember what it felt like to get to this point in Ezra chapter nine. It's such a payoff to just have somebody get it and see it. The recurring problem is this. It's a cool drink of water in an otherwise really often very difficult read going through this part of the Bible up until right now. It's like when there's a great evil or a great lingering problem in a serial TV show that you're watching, maybe even that has multiple seasons. And there's just one great truth that no one will acknowledge. No one is willing to own and it just festers constantly and as a viewer, you're dying from any character to see how things are and to say it in a way that even other people hear and might respond to so that the situation that has been upside down and wrecked for so long over the course of the show might be righted because the solution is right there. It's this somebody needs to acknowledge it and this thing could get straightened out. That is how Ezra nine and that prayer feels to me when I've read straight through the Bible and get to this point. Aha. Somebody gets it. Somebody sees it and they're out pointing the finger at everybody else. They're prepared to own it, including owning the consequences of it and owning the work it's going to take to make the thing right to be the people that God had called them to be and getting just a tiny bit squishy and personal here at the end. I think there's some pretty good cues in there for those steps toward coming back from something you screwed up or coming back from a mess that you've inherited from somebody else. There's a ton of humility in this. There's a ton of clarity in this. There's a ton of taking your time and seeing the big picture. There's a ton of painting a picture of where you need to go and what you need to be doing next with the thing. And there's a ton of reliance on and gratitude toward God, which only makes sense for our continued existence and everything that we have and hearing someone else pray like that, seeing someone else respond to calamity that isn't even entirely of their own making like that is it has a very softening effect on my heart and makes me want to emulate and imitate the spirit behind that, as I think about my own life and the messes both little and big that I inherit from time to time and more often that are of my own making. Good place to shut it down. As we're chapter 10 tomorrow, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
