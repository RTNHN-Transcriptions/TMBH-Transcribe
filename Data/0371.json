This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. And for those of you who are brand new here, what we do is every day we go through the book of Matthew one tiny little bit at a time. Matthew is one of the four books of the New Testament that tells the story of Jesus and what he did and who he was and what people made of him. And right now, we're in a part of Matthew that deals with that last question. What do people make of him? So if this is your first time here, thank you for jumping in. You don't have to go back to the beginning to figure out what we're doing, but I mean, hopefully you're going to be like, Oh, it's fun. I really want to do more of this. And there's a whole giant back catalog and you will go back and do all of that. And to those of you who have been hanging out with me and who've worked our way through a huge amount of Bible congratulations on putting in the work and the time and hopefully enjoyable conversations together to get this book about the most influential character in all of human history in your hip pocket and on lockdown. So I am not quite ready to formally announce all the details yet, but I am working on a new podcast right now. I've recorded a whole bunch of episodes and I think it's going to be really, really, really fun. It's very different than what we're doing here. And without giving away details yet, they will be forthcoming very, very soon. This new podcast has me sitting down with a whole bunch of interesting people with very interesting stories. And some of the stories they tell me are like, Oh, okay, I see what you're doing there. I get what was going on. And others, I'm more confused by what the story is, not in a bad way, but I just don't immediately get what they're talking about. And that's part of the fun is then we try to workshop it together. But one of the things that I like to do is just ask them, well, what do people make of your story? What kind of read? What kind of feedback do you get? And it's very good for making the conversation go. And likewise, in chapter 16, we have come to this place in the gospel of Matthew, a book that is entirely dedicated to convincing Matthew's own ethnic brethren and sisters, the Jewish people that Jesus is their long awaited Messiah. So we're to chapter 16 in this book that is dedicated to that purpose. And Matthew from the very beginning has been unapologetic about who Jesus is. I mean, is it like the first line? Yeah, a record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. So right from the beginning, Matthew is like, Hey, I'm clear on who he is. He is this guy. And then in chapter one, verse 18, when he gets to the end of that big, long genealogy where he explains who Jesus is descended from to demonstrate his kinglyness, he then says, this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. Like, Oh, okay. So Matthew from a literary perspective is doing one of those things on the front end where it's like, okay, here's the big moment in the whole thing, freeze frame, needle scratch on record. Hey, that guy right there, that's Jesus Christ to the Messiah. You're probably wondering how we got here. Well, it's quite the story. Let me tell you, it started a few years back when I was and so on and so forth. So Matthew's conclusion to the big question that he's addressing in this book is something that he's not shy about. He puts it right at the front end. But as you and I've discussed, given the cultural context of the moment, this is going to be a tough pill for people to swallow because they were like red socks or Cubs fans circa 2000. They'd been waiting forever to win and they didn't really know what to do and they actually did win. The people Matthew's right into they were so used to looking for the Messiah. That is kind of weird when one that maybe could be the Messiah was actually there. So Matthew's warming them up to the idea and one little anecdote at a time, one teaching at a time. He's demonstrating like, Hey, if this isn't the guy, what would the guy look like? He's the guy, folks. But by the time once again that we get to chapter 16, no one from the core group of people who are following Jesus around has mustered the clarity or the courage to just say, Yeah, you're the Christ, the Messiah, the son of God, the one we've been waiting for. Instead, you get people poking around the edges like, Hey, are you the one we've been waiting for? Could you just give us verbal confirmation one way or the other? You've got people asking rhetorical questions that indicate that they think Jesus is the long awaited Messiah, the one who's going to show up and resolve the problem of sin and suffering and death and the gap between God and humanity. And they're like, Who is this guy? Even though they're really asking that in a way where the answer is obvious, but they're kind of maybe hoping somebody else will say it first. It really was a culturally incredibly bold thing to be the first one to come out and say who in fact it appeared that Jesus is. And so this is how I see the narrative playing out. We're getting to a bit of a time crunch here. Jesus took the disciples and he was trying to teach them stuff and get them ready because at least as of chapter 14, nobody seems to really get who he is or what he's trying to build here, how grandiose his plans for redemption are. And then John the Baptist, Jesus cousin gets killed, weird party and Jesus tries to go in mourn, but he ends up getting followed by a big crowd. He does miracles and he heals them. And then he gets confronted by some angry religious leaders. He's like, Oh, we just need to get away. And he gets away on a road trip up north for a while. But even that gets cut short by people coming to him for help and he has compassion on them and he helps them. But I'm sure this felt like one of these things where it's like, ah, we blocked out this time and we're not getting all the things done that we need to get done. I need my core group to get who I am and to get where this thing is going. And so then we get into chapter 16 and Jesus has a confrontation with more religious leaders who don't like them and those religious leaders demand a sign and Jesus says you're not going to get any sign except the sign of Jonah, which we know from Matthew chapter 12 is an allusion to the fact that Jesus is going to die. So his own death and resurrection and the end of his time physically on this planet are in view for him. And yet still at this point, none of the disciples have actually really come out and hit on the head who he actually is. So he goes at this question that like I mentioned a minute ago can just be a good way to get people to unpack their own riddle or to revisit a situation they've thought about for a long time from a slightly different angle. Now, if we're not quite ready to say what we make of this, well, let's just pivot that a little bit and ask, what have you heard from other people? What do they make of this? So officially it goes like this, Matthew 16 starting in verse 13, when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, which we discussed last time, he asked his disciples, who do the people say the son of man is? And they replied. Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah and still others Jeremiah are one of the prophets. And those are really interesting and telling answers. I mean, John the Baptist really is doing something different than Jesus. He said, there's the Lamb of God who takes the way the sins of the world when he saw Jesus walking up and he's like, I'm not even fit to untie that dude's shoelaces. He is the one who's supposed to be coming. I baptized with water, but that guy's doing like the real baptism that's actually truly efficacious and transformative. So John the Baptist, it wouldn't make sense for Jesus to be John the Baptist because John the Baptist pointed toward Jesus. But you know, it's close. Others said Elijah and what was the heart of Elijah's message in the Old Testament? I mean, first Kings, we see him on the scene and interacting with people and the common theme that we seem to get from him is that the people of Israel, God's chosen people, they need to turn from sin and repent and be attentive to the real true God. Well, that sounds a lot like John the Baptist's message. In a lot of ways, John the Baptist was picking up the mantle of the stuff that Elijah had said and both of those things are a good message. But Jesus has been talking about something more than just that, though Jesus has used that language and repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. But then Jesus goes on to indicate that the kingdom of heaven is at hand because he is here. But John the Baptist is a pretty insufficient but safe evaluation kind of funny that the disciples here are maybe referencing Herod in terms of who people say Jesus is because the text tells us that Herod thought that maybe Jesus was John the Baptist come back from the dead at another point. So you got that out there, Elijah's a decent guest as well, but it still seems like Jesus is doing something different. Jeremiah is the taken prophet. He's the prophet, he's like Liam Neeson when his daughter calls under the bed and is like, look, you're going to be taken. And then he explains like this is what's going to happen. You're going to exile. It's going to hurt for a while, but be faithful, live well in society. God hasn't forgotten you. He still has plans for you. So that's not really the message of Jesus either. Jeremiah is very deferential down the road. This is coming. You're going to have to endure for a while, but a thing will come whereas Jesus is more like, no, the thing is come. I am the thing. Here it is. It's go time. So it's interesting that the disciples throw out answers that I think they know are wrong, but they're dancing around it. I can't remember if I told you this or not, but when Walk Like An Egyptian by the Bengals came out when I was a kid, I was right in the back of the Datsun 210 with my sister Kendra one time and we both liked the song. But at that point, my parents were in a pretty musically conservative phase where if it was old and it's like the sixties or something, that's fine. But it was like new pop music or rock in any way. It was kind of like, that's dirty. We don't really do that. You can listen to Lamer Christian versions of the same thing, but they weren't real sure about radio pop now. They're in a totally different place. As my sister and I were in the backseat, Hummin, Walk Like An Egyptian or whatever, because we were little kids when we were singing a pop song and dad hears it. He's like, what song are you singing there? And we both knew that the name of it sounded ridiculous and that it was obviously poppy. So both Kendra and I pretended not to know, we're like, oh, I just, I just can't remember at all. I'd assist you. No, I couldn't. Mm. Ah, and we hummed and hot and all of that stuff because neither of us wanted to take the risk of actually saying it out loud. And it really does feel like that's what's going on here. I think these guys know the answer to the question, but they want to throw a few things out and just see if Jesus raises an eyebrow. I think these guys are in a position of weakness and uncertainty. The last passage where they didn't know if Jesus was mad at them about bread or something, we forget the sandwiches. What are we supposed to do? Shows that their heads are spinning. They know they're supposed to be learning a lesson here. They feel the pressure of the moment and the time, but they don't really get why. And so like any of us might do in our insecurities, sensing that we are in a profound moment with someone we highly respect, we trial balloon a few safe answers that would be a compliment and that we think we wouldn't get in trouble for before we maybe try the thing we really think. And while I feel tremendous empathy and patience for these guys in gently and deftly trying to feel this thing out, it's also pretty cool that in the next couple of verses where Jesus presses them for an actual answer that one of these guys, Peter, is finally ready to just be like, you know what, I'm just doing it. We all know the answer. You're the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of the living God. You. Thanks for hanging out with me, everybody. We'll do more of this manana. I'm Matt.
