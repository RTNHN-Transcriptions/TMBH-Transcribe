stories that I've already told you before and generally the story sounds I hope the same as the last time I told you but I don't know time passes memories fade I think I'm getting this story right a few years ago my son and one of his buddies were goofing around at our house you know just having fun being boys no problem at all my wife and one of her friends had recently just done a bunch of spring planting in these flower pots and they went up to the store and they picked out the flower pots to fit the space and they did this you know the whole color analysis to make it just look the right way with the color of the house and the season and they spent all day out there getting their hands dirty and making these you know beautiful flower pots it was absolutely lovely well then my son and his little buddy were just running around doing boy things but they weren't being real thoughtful and they way over swung the screen door like the kind of thing that for the dads out there just makes you absolutely cringe like oh why would you do that it's not how those doors are supposed to work that's not normal use don't yank on that like that it's not stress tested for that kind of thing and sure enough they yanked it way beyond the range of its hinges damage the door a little bit nothing that couldn't be fixed but in doing so they knocked the biggest and the most beautiful of these planters off of the porch and broke it and destroyed it it was a great big mess my wife's positioning by the way of the planter was flawless there was no reason for her to believe that anyone would ever yank that door that far beyond its specification or factory established range she read everything right she's guilt-free in this the boys just made a mistake okay cool the opportunity to learn right so all the stuff is broken lay on the ground I call him over and we had this great talk about how difficult beauty is beauty is hard this took a ton of work to make this beautiful thing wrecking things is easy it takes only a moment of thoughtlessness to destroy something that it took a ton effort to make beautiful but there's this other thing that we can do as well and that is called redemption it is also hard and laborious but it's a beautiful process by which we take things that were beautiful and got wrecked and make them beautiful again and likewise that is one of the central themes of the Bible God made creation he made people in his own image the crown jewel of his creation and he looked at the whole thing and he was like huh that's good he called his work good and then if you know the story from the very beginning of the Bible and Genesis sin enters the equation and it wrecks stuff and there's still goodness and beauty to be found in all of it because God hasn't abandoned at all his presence is still there it was still made by God but it's twisted up it's perverted by sin and failure and wickedness and ugliness and death and then there's this brief moment of tension early in the book of Genesis where as the reader for the first time you're like well well God just quit is he out is he done well I mean he could just make a new heavens and a new earth and just start over he could just make it so it's like this whole thing never happened he could even ordain that no celestial being ever even remember that this failed build of existence happened and then broke but no immediately you figure out oh no he's gonna redeem it he's gonna fix it he's going to lovingly and carefully over time scoop back up all of that scattered dirt he's going to mend the pot that was broken and he's going to put the flowers back in there and nurture them back into something beautiful and as you read along further you kind of get the impression that the story of it was beautiful it broke and then it got redeemed is even more glorifying to God and more demonstrative of his character and his goodness than if the story had just been he made something awesome and then there it was and nothing ever happened redemption is hard redemption is expensive redemption is at the heart of the character and the impulses and the work of God and so we get this word redeemed in Galatians 3 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us now the first half of that sentence is beautiful right I mean that's kind of stuff that you're into that's why you show up if you're a Christian you eventually figure out that I am like the pot that has been knocked off of the porch there is a brokenness here I do not as a broken pot have the ability to reassemble myself and put the flowers back in there all neatly arranged I have to have outside help I just cannot do this thing and you realize I cannot redeem myself I need a redeemer and then yeah you read the Bible you encounter God however it happens for you you're like oh dang redemption comes from God it is the gift of God through Christ Jesus not by anything that I do but by faith in Christ and it changes your world it changes everything is the most incredible thing ever so we're gonna love verses in the Bible where it's about redemption because if you're not moved by that story you're probably not a Christian I don't even know what's wrong with you that is the coolest thing of the coolest things and then you get to the second half of Galatians 3 13 you're like Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law yay by becoming a curse for us Christ became a curse wait what is that how does that exactly work and we're just gonna have to come back to that in a future conversation because that raises a lot of questions but the first half of that verse is just universally rad if you're into the things of God or being a Christian or even if you're just thinking about it it's great this concept of redemption and if you've been around the Bible for a while there is one book that anytime you hear the word redemption or the here the idea discussed in the Bible of being bought back from being a slave to something a slave to sin a slave to your own mistakes whatever it is this one book which is a little book in the Old Testament is the thing that eventually springs to mind this is the redemption book and it's the book of Hosea now okay where's Hosea I got a trick for remembering these things remember you had all the major prophets in the Old Testament that's like the halfway mark of the Bible if you turn to the halfway mark it's gonna be about where the big major prophets of the Old Testament start Isaiah and Jeremiah and Daniel all that but then right before the New Testament there's a bunch of teeny tiny little quick hitter books these are called the minor prophets not because they didn't do anything useful but because the minor prophets are just shorter the books are way shorter and it's really easy even for somebody's been around the Bible for a long time to have all of that mentally run together and to forget what order they go in and fumble around for a real long time awkwardly so I've got my own little mental acrostic for everything that happens after the major prophet of Daniel all the way to the end of the Old Testament three little phrases Homer Jaus angry otters that's Hosea Joel Amos Obadiah Jonah might navigate happily Jonah Micah nay hum habakkak zebras hurdle Zamboni machines Zephaniah Hagai Zechariah Malachi you might be like how do those two Z ones at the end like how do you remember which ones F and I and Zechariah with your little zebras hurdles and bony machines thing it doesn't seem like that really differentiates between the two and to that I would say hey shut up so we go to the book of Hosea which is the first of the minor prophets and what we see here is there's a narrative you think of the prophets and you think oh well these aren't really narrative there oracles or whatever where God's like tell the people of Israel that I pronounce three curses upon them for the following reasons and then the prophets like here are the curses but Hosea has got a little story to it and the prophet himself plays a role in the story interesting Hosea was a prophet in the late 700s BC in the northern kingdom of Israel pretty much all the prophets in the Old Testament are talking to the southern kingdom of Judah or they are happening after the northern and southern kingdoms fall and they're talking to the Jewish people after they get taken into captivity and they're functioning as a captive people group in Babylon or Persia so that's a 500s or 400 to BC so it's pretty rare to come across a prophet who's talking to the northern kingdom of Israel only Jonah Amos and Hosea speak to them as you might expect all three of these prophets are pretty negative about the northern kingdom because the northern kingdom is a dumpster fire all the time they don't really have any good kings everybody up there does a ratty job I mean this is kind of an apostate group up north it looks like they're little vestiges or hints of remembrance of the things of God and the covenant that God made with Abraham and Moses the covenant to bless these people and also that they would one day be a blessing to all the nations and maybe a little bit of remembrance but for the most part the kings all seem to forget and the northern kingdom is a mess and it's the first to go in 722 BC the Assyrians come along and conquer their capital city and that's it that's the end of the northern kingdom altogether so Hosea is speaking right at the end of that as things are falling apart or as things are about to completely fall apart but like I said a minute ago he is a character in his own book of prophecy and he gets to play a really unfortunate role in this whole story as sort of an object lesson with his own life and it's a very painful object lesson but it is a dramatic story of redemption in the most literal sense that plays out in the book of Hosea much like the beautiful flower pot that gets knocked off the porch and broken and then a lot of energy has to go back into putting it back together and redeeming and restoring it there's imagery here about God's faithfulness and how redemption works and due to the nature of the passage of time we're going to unpack what that imagery is and how the story of the book of Hosea goes tomorrow but the bottom line is redemption is not some new concept the Paul is just bringing up willy-nilly in Galatians chapter 3 it is a beloved cherished concept that runs through the entire Old Testament and New Testament but everybody Paul was talking to you would have had this notion of you know some visual image in their own brains a little different than mine but it'd be right there of some kind of beautiful thing being wrecked but God having these promises outstanding to say if you turn back to me I will remember you and I will restore your thing and I will make it beautiful again and Hosea is one of the books it really tells that story so we'll look at the details of that in support of Galatians chapter 3 manana I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon you", "segments": [{"id": 0,
