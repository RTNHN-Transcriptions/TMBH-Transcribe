That's what I want to be known for. Nobody wants to be hypocrite. Nobody is seeking out how to be a fraud and hold one set of values and one set of circumstances and a different set of values in a different set of circumstances. It's gross. It's incredibly easy to detect hypocrisy in people who aren't us. It's very easy for me to look at other people's politics and be like, oh my goodness, look at you people. How can you simultaneously, full-throatedly endorse this important moral imperative that is absolutely inarguable and you're so superior in this situation, but then you go over here to this slightly different situation that doesn't benefit you politically and, well, inarguable moral universal truth, suddenly it just slips your mind. It doesn't come up so much, but it's incredible to me how easy it is for other people to look at the values that I hold and point out the exact same problems. I think hypocrisy is endemic to humanity because of the way we're built. We encounter the world through our five senses. Most of our five senses are screwed onto our face. So everything we see from our point of view is from our point of view. It's going to be really natural for us to gerrymander the rules that we live by and the deeply held convictions that we have around what benefits us. And if you think about the most mature, most impressive people you've ever met, they're the ones who are steady, they're consistent. And even if it costs them something or their team something to hold some deep value or moral truth that they're committed to, they will still stick to it, even if it's costly. And then when you think about the people who are most pedestrian and normal and predictably selfish, well, they're not consistent in those things. The one consistent value that normal person holds is they really like things that benefit them. Well, the Bible would seem to hold out the idea that we are hypocritical and we have problems and that hypocrisy is a sole issue. It demonstrates that something is really screwed up and wrong and off. It's something of a litmus test in the teachings of Jesus as to whether or not we've actually encountered the forgiveness of God, whether we're actually a son, a daughter, an heir, an agent of the kingdom, someone who has been transformed by the values of the kingdom. And this is evident from pretty early on in Jesus teaching me think back to stuff that you and I have talked about a whole bunch. You got the Matthew chapter seven business from the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus is talking about the log in your own eye and the spec and other people's eyes. You're not worried about the gigantic problem with you, but you are worried about this little tiny thing with somebody else. And then he goes on to say, whatever measure you want for others, that's the measure that's going to be used on use. And I mean, the suggestion is be very careful. If you do the hypocrite thing in the kingdom, you will be assigned the harshest measure you use on anyone for yourself. But maybe the better measure to use would be God's measure of grace, patience, long suffering with other people's problems because the righteousness that's required to enter the kingdom of heaven is described in Matthew chapter five. It would have to exceed even the Pharisees and Sadducees describes. I mean, it's too much righteousness. You can't do it. You can't pull it off on your own. And so the idea is that there's this righteousness that is apart from good behavior, that is apart from the law that is from God, and that Jesus alone is the giver of this righteousness. He imparts it onto people. So any kind of attitude that somebody brings into this new kingdom, this new family of faith, where it's like, well, look how good I am and look how bad everybody else is. And I don't have to be forgiving because I'm good. That attitude on the most fundamental level, it does not square with how the kingdom is built. And that's why the centerpiece of the Sermon on the Mount is the Lord's Prayer. And in the Lord's Prayer, you'll recall, there's only one thing that the prayer of the Lord's Prayer says they're going to do. Everything else about the Lord's Prayer is, Oh, King, please do this, please provide in this way. But the one thing in the middle of that prayer, which is in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount, which is in the middle of the ideas of the values of the kingdom that we do is forgive, forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. It doesn't even say, help us forgive the ideal prayer that Jesus gives to his followers and says this, then is how you should pray assumes that forgiveness is already happening, is constantly happening, is absolutely unlimited. And again, I acknowledge that even in our conversations, we've talked about the difference between reconciliation, which is not always possible because that's up to two parties and forgiveness, which is always possible because it's only up to one party to forgive. And the assumption here from Jesus is if you have been forgiven, you have to give away forgiveness. You cannot ask for the forgiveness of God for you while wanting the judgment of God or your own judgment for others. And that principle is one that we're still dealing with as we get into Matthew chapter 18 and all of the business where Peter comes along. And I think like a kid wanting to please his teacher is like, I will forgive more than is even recommended. Jesus, should we forgive? Like what do you say? Seven times even, which I think is really good. It's a lot. That's forward thinking. But Jesus answers, I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times. And then Jesus goes on from there to drill at home with a parable that really makes the same point. If you receive forgiveness, you have to be giving forgiveness away. And the story Jesus gives goes like this. Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like king who wanted to settle accounts with the servants. And as you begin the settlement, a man who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him since he was not able to pay the master order that he and his wife and children and all he had be sold to repay the debt. Observation number one is that this parable starts the same way that the kingdom parables of Matthew 13 start. All but one of those starts with the kingdom of heaven is like and the idea of the parables in Matthew 13, which is the kingdom parable discourse. It's a third of the five big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured. The kingdom parables discourse would seem to be addressing the question, how is the kingdom going to work out? Jesus is doing miracles. Seems like he owns all the laws of time and space and can do whatever he wants. His teaching is brilliant. Everybody should be signing up, but not everybody is signing up. Some people, it seems like they even kind of want to kill him. How does this work out? How long is this going to go? And the kingdom seems really, really small. How is it going to accomplish all of these big things that Jesus is promising? Matthew 13 covers all of that stuff. But what I think is interesting here is that we're getting a hybrid parable by saying the kingdom of heaven is like we're harkening back to, okay, here's how the kingdom is going to unfold. Do you guys remember this formula from chapter 13? But we're in the middle of this new family of faith, this community life discourse. So we're hybridizing these two things. Here's how the kingdom is going to unfold, but specifically, here's what the unfolding of the kingdom should look like at the level of your heart. It should look like someone who is overflowing with forgiveness because of the forgiveness they've received, but it also includes a warning and I'm fast forwarding ahead to the end of a parable you and I haven't even read all the way through yet. It also includes a warning to say the kingdom of heaven is like, well, a very scary judgment for the person who on the front end of the kingdom gets shown incredible mercy and forgiveness. But on the back end of the kingdom in their own life and how it plays out in their own life, they aren't willing to give any of that away to others. They want their debts forgiven, but they want to collect on every last dang penny of everything everybody else owes them. And so by invoking this, the kingdom of heaven is like thing. Jesus is setting this up to say there's a possible beautiful outcome here, which is forgiveness begets forgiveness, a transformed heart that can't help but want to duplicate the essence of the values that provided them that desperately needed forgiveness in the first place. But there's a dire warning for what happens if that desperately needed forgiveness that is provided in the first place doesn't translate into a heart that is bent on giving forgiveness to others. I just touched on like five elements of this parable beginning, middle and end without even having read the whole thing yet. It's just going to have to be a two part or we're going to pick it up right where we left off and keep going on this parable of the unmerciful servant. That's what it usually gets called in your Bible notes. We're going to pick up on that next time around. Hey, thank you to everybody who supports the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. That is how this happens. And it's voluntary. Obviously this thing's free. It'll always be free. So for some of you to be like, huh, I would like to voluntarily kick in money on a thing that I can have for nothing is ridiculously kind of you. So thank you for making that happen. And to those of you who are not patrons of the program, don't ever feel like you have to do that. It's awesome. If it ever makes sense for you, it's also just awesome that you're here. Thank you for being a part of this thing. I'm Matt.
