My family and I a few weeks ago to New Zealand. We saved up all of our little credit card points and our nickels and our dollars and we used all of our coupons. We were going to go. We were going to do this super budget, awesome trip of a lifetime trip to New Zealand. I was so excited, but of course we do the hobbit stuff, but also it was going to do a bunch of fly fishing and it didn't work. I got the COVID's right before it was time to go and it just didn't seem right. I was going to make everybody sick and also I felt terrible. It just didn't work. We had our trip insurance and all that. We got more or less our money back, but once I got better a few days later, we were just sitting there and I was like, well, we got the next two weeks. We all did all this work to carve it out so we could do a big family thing together. We should still go somewhere. So we sat down at the computer and we used Google flights and we just searched the rapid city to anywhere on earth. And what we're looking for is two criteria. One, real, real cheap and two, real, real interesting. What comes up? Rome Italy was super cheap to fight a Rome. Just here a few weeks ago from where I live. So we grabbed our stuff that was still packed and we threw it in the vehicle and we went to the airport and we just left. It was like a no notice trip is crazy. And what an adventure was. Some things went really well. Some things, not surprisingly, because of the last minute nature of our travel plans did not go quite as well. Funny story. Maybe I'll tell you about it some other time, but what did go well? My friends was getting to see my kids unwrap the present of Italy and all the, like, the layers of history that are there. I got to watch that happen. I've been there a bunch for work and stuff, but they've never been there. And so it's phenomenal because you get the classical history and you get the medieval history and you get the early modern Baroque era history and you get the Christian history and the secular. It's just great. I mean, it's completely in my wheelhouse, right? And so we went to a bajillion amazing churches and the kids were appropriately in awe of all of that. Obviously, you know, they got to look at St. Peter's. It's the biggest church in the world. That place is pretty cool. We got a real good look at the Duomo, the main cathedral there in Florence, which is, I think it's top 10 biggest churches in the world. There's one in the little mountain town of Orvieto that was incredible. We went to a couple of cool churches in Verona and Trent and Venice and we just trained all over the place and lived like hobos and had a great time. One of the themes of this trip that I think will always remember is the amazing accomplishments of these Christians from the past who built these buildings that we would just never, ever, ever build now. And I don't think in all of my travels and adventures and filming churches and talking to people to make churches going all that, I don't think it has ever been as clear for me as it was on this trip. How unusual it is to have a historical moment where society is so unified and so focused on one outcome for more than a generation, because it takes a long time to do something like that, that they would produce those kind of edifices. And that as much as the building itself impressed me on this trip. And then I come back here and I sit down on my desk and I get going on things for the book of Nehemiah and I crack open Ezra and start reading through that preparation for all of this. I'm like, dang, it's the same deal here. There just had not been the unity of thought or purpose for generations and generations by the time we get to the stories described in the book of Ezra where God's chosen people had been of one accord and one mind to really accomplish anything amazing, anything great together at all. And there's a certain sadness to that. It's a sadness I think we feel right now in the world that we're not out building things like that. Corporations are building big things, but they're all sterile and they sort of inflict values on people and they're all built on the back of kind of weird credit and non-social agreement. We don't build things like they built in a few of these chapters in the past. And I think that if you feel any of that impulse when you look at the amazing things that the people before us built, born out of their sense of unity and shared identity, if you can feel that, then I think you can relate to what people would have felt like on the front end of the stories that are given to us in Ezra and Nehemiah. It had been an age since they had come together and done anything incredible. It had been an age since they had made things or celebrated things or had a cultural identity, a religious and cultural identity that was so dialed and unified that they could speak in one accord and act in one accord. And there's a tragedy to that, a sense that the best days are behind. And I don't know where that's going for us now, but I really don't know. But back then, I'm sure there was a sense of discouragement like the best days that are behind us are the days that remind us of God's promise to redeem, to redeem everything for us to be his people and for him to be our God. And where do we go from here? And so when you turn the page from the end of second Chronicles to the beginning of Ezra, there is this renewed tone, especially if you just got done reading through the whole Old Testament. There's this fresh tone of hope and optimism like, whoa, wait a second. It seemed like it was all on a glide path down into Crashville. And now all of a sudden there's a bit of an uptake here. There's some optimism here. At the end of second Chronicles, it sounds like everything's going to end up bad because the southern kingdom has now been conquered. 586 BC by Nebuchadnezzar. The northern kingdom is long since gone, hauled into captivity by the Assyrians and then basically bred and distributed and killed and enslaved out of existence. It just looks like everything is ruined. But then right at the end of second Chronicles, which is the book that immediately proceeds Ezra and Nehemiah, it says this, final verses, 2 Chronicles 36, 22 and forward. In the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus, King of Persia, to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing. This is what Cyrus, King of Persia, says, The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Any one of his people among you may the Lord his God be with him and let him go up.\" And that's where it leaves off. This open-ended thing is like, yeah, I mean, it feels like most of second Chronicles got us into pretty disappointing territory. But the book ends on this crazy, gigantic high note that leaves the reader wondering, well, is anybody going to take Cyrus up on that? Does that mean things are going to get better? Does that mean things are maybe going to be good for the first time forever? Does that mean that the lessons will be learned that clearly the whole story up to this point is demanding the lessons need to be learned and they're not being learned and people aren't getting it. Are they going to figure it out now? All these questions are percolating as we, listen to this, I crinkled that a little extra just to make the point, turn the page to the book of Ezra and it picks up exactly where things leave off at the end of second Chronicles. Diving right into that question of, will there be enough unity, enough accord among the people, enough shared vision, of personality, of style, of culture, of religious faith that they can rekindle something and go and take advantage of this opportunity that has been laid up in front of them by Cyrus and according to the text, by God himself. This is how Ezra 1 opens. In the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moved to the heart of Cyrus, King of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing is the sounding familiar it should because it's like exactly the same thing that it says at the end of second Chronicles. Let's keep going now. Verse two, this is what Cyrus, King of Persia says, the Lord, the God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he's appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. He wanted his people among you, may his God be with him and let him go up. And now it's going to go on a little bit to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the Lord, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem and the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold with goods and livestock and with free will offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem. I mean, is that not the thickest, darkest, most obvious shaded Venn diagram ever? And you see exactly where second Chronicles overlaps with Ezra. That's very intentional. The author of Ezra, who may also be the author of second Chronicles and is possible clearly wants you to know we are picking up exactly where this story left off last time around and anybody with any common sense who just got done reading first and second Chronicles is going to come in to Ezra saying, well, all the hurdles are removed. After the first four verses of Ezra with the extended proclamation of Cyrus, now we know that this thing is funded. We know that it's backed by the great King of Kings. We know that resistance to this rebuilding is prohibited. We know that Cyrus, not only at least in word, views this rebuilding of the temple and rebuilding of Jerusalem as a good idea politically, at least in word. He seems to view it as a good idea religiously as well. It seems at least, if we take him, what he's written down, that he maybe thinks there is a God in Jerusalem. Maybe it's even the God. Now, I think Cyrus was probably some sort of pluralist based on other things that we know about him. It seems that he was a worshipper of the God over a Mazda and that he was willing to acknowledge the God of other local groups. Maybe he was a guy who hedged his bets a little bit or who knows. Maybe he wrote this at a time where he did have some sort of clarity about the God of Israel, whatever the case, the result is the same. All of the obstacles to accomplishing what needs to be accomplished, that is go back to Jerusalem, rebuild the temple, resume the sacrifice. And the temple life and the religious rhythms of the Jewish people restore the relationship between God's people and the living generations therein and God obey God, be a distinct people and accomplish the purposes that God set aside the Jewish people to accomplish in the grand redemptive plan. That's the task. You need to go back and start that almost from scratch. And there's really no reason not to do it now. Rather than can you pull yourselves together and have some sort of vision for what needs to be done? Do you have the cultural willpower? Do you have the unity, the fortitude and the clarity to go and do what needs to be done and to go and be who you need to be as a people? That setup right there is it's a big question that takes us into everything that's going to get answered in Ezra and Nehemiah. So in the same way that you go and look at the Duomo in Milan or you look at St. Peter's Basilica or any of the other great amazing achievements that are distant ancestors toiled over for generations and left behind for us as a testament to who they were and what they believed and their shared vision to accomplish things. In the same way that we can tell something was really working. They were on the same page for a period of time when we see those great buildings. So we are eager to see on the front end of Ezra and Nehemiah whether these people who at times in the past have had flourishes of that kind of unity can now muster maybe the greatest sense of that unity and shared cultural and religious clarity they've ever had to go and accomplish a very difficult task even with the skids being completely greased by this proclamation from the most powerful person in the world the King of Kings Cyrus the Great. And next time around we're going to buzz through a handful of chapters of Ezra and look at some very promising progress to these ends that we see here in the early going. Finally, a quick programming note. Hopefully a whole bunch of you support the program at any level in any way on any platform are starting to receive your Nehemiah books in the mail along with a bunch of little cards with QR codes on them that you can maybe give to somebody if you want to do invite them to check this thing out as well as your super rad awesome achievement unlocked sticker to commemorate what you accomplished in the season of your life where you went through the book of Esther. Hopefully you're getting those stickers that I sent you as well and finding somewhere awesome to display that as a marker for what you did and what you accomplished. And I'm really grateful to all of you and I've enjoyed hearing back from those of you who have received that. Thanks for sharing a high five with me over that. I'm pretty excited about what we accomplished to and I'm pretty excited about what we're working on right now with Ezra and Nehemiah. All right, that's plenty for today. I'm Matt.
