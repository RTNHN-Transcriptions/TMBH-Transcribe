We're working through the middle part of Esther chapter 9. It's a part of the book where we see how the sausage is made. It was really fun to children's bookify the book of Esther and to go through all the stuff where she's brave and beautiful and cunning and shrewd and the clown king is duped and worked over and to do in the right thing after he got duped and worked over and to do in the wrong thing. And then the Jews just vaguely, they just win and they don't die. And it's great. And Heyman, he just dies. And that's just the he got his come up in. That's fun. But when you actually look at it and think about it, you see that the means by which they win and what it would take for them to truly secure victory in this moment in history and in this political environment, well, it's pretty jarring. I mean, it's one of those deals where everybody likes a good steak, but nobody wants to date the butcher. That's not true. I've got a great friend who's a butcher and he has a lovely wife. That saying doesn't work for me at all. Everybody likes the sausage, but not many people want to see how the sausage is made. I think that one was a little bit better. But the point is to achieve true political victory to ensure the survival of her people, what we're discovering as we think carefully over these last few days about Esther chapter nine and how this all actually practically works out. It's ugly. It's ugly. It was an ugly situation and it got an ugly solution. And in an age of moral equivalency where all things are just kind of equal and there isn't any sort of good or bad, it would make our compasses spin about this thing in the moral age that we're reading about here in the fifth century BC. It's just it's presented as unequivocally good. It's assumed that the audience would look at what we're reading about and say, well, yeah, I mean, how else are you going to win that? You'd have to defeat every single person with any access to this highly manipulatable king who would want to kill the Jews because all it takes is a couple of drinks in his system and an hour or two of unsupervised time. And he could be persuaded to go off and write some other crazy edict or worse yet. Let somebody else write it and then we're right back to where we started. And so what we're reading about is a political reality whereby victory means stuff that you and I aren't going to like or be comfortable with. But the original audience in the original author seemed to be completely at peace with everything that it takes to actually win in this environment in this time. And that includes some very punitive stuff that is meant to send a political message that says, here's what happens if you choose to try to pick up where Heyman left off. Do you ever hear about the cadaver sinned? I mean, we're just having so much fun this week. I think we've probably talked about this at some point, right? We've known each other for a long time. We've talked about a lot of things. If not, well, let me just jog your memory. This is a thing called the cadaver sinned. If I recall correctly, it was Pope Sylvester and Pope Formosis that the issue was with. But again, I don't remember for sure. It's going to use the robot that I keep on my desk. I misspelled cadaver. That's embarrassing. I didn't have to tell you that. But I did anyway. Okay, the cadaver sinned January of 897. It was Pope Formosis who was tried by. Oh, well, I was totally wrong on who the other pope was. It was Pope Stephen the sixth. Oops. Okay. Well, whatever. And wow, I feel like I owe Pope Sylvester gigantic apology. It's embarrassing. So this Pope Stephen guy was like, hey, I have a huge gripe with my predecessor. And so we're going to exhum his body and we're going to throw it up there on the papal throne in the St. John's Lateran Church, which is the home church of the pope. It's not the Vatican. St. John's just a little bit down the street is the home church of the pope. And we're going to put him on trial for stuff that he did wrong. And sure enough, he was found guilty. And his body got mutilated and stuff to make a point. I think that's a pretty good summary. But I was wrong about one of the two popes. So I don't know. Go go check it out. The point is throughout history, there have been moments where people have wanted to send a message to say, Hey, whatever these people are doing, don't take up their cause. Don't do that. We're divorcing ourselves from where they were now, just because people do that doesn't mean they're right. I mean, a lot of times they're wrong. It's kind of a terrorizing way to make the point, but displaying people's bodies, you know, that's one of the ways that you get the point across. Apparently, Edward, the long shanks famously did it to William Wallace after he was executed. And so we're going to get that is going to be part of the purge. And lovely beloved Queen Esther is going to be the one who is the main motivator behind the public display of corpses as a way to discourage anyone viewing Heyman as a martyr and taking up his cause, troubling to us, to the original audience. I believe this would have been understood as this is what it takes to make sure this is actually a victory. So here's what we get. The king, as we discussed yesterday, I believe a broken man says to Esther, all right, now what is your petition? It'll be given you. What's your request? It will also be granted. She replies Esther nine verse 13, if it pleases the king, give the Jews and Sousa permission to carry out this day's edict tomorrow also and let Haman's 10 sons be hanged on gallows. Now to be clear, they're already dead. All 10 of them, they got swept up in the first day of fighting in the first purge. They would be the 10 people most likely to take up the cause of their deceased father and in true purge fashion, all ethics and morality aside, they get killed. Where are their bodies? I don't know some Persian morgue. I don't know what was going on here. I think we're still in the throes of chaos and violence in the city, but Esther, she wants to make this point. So verse 14, the king commanded that this be done and edict was issued in Sousa and they hanged the 10 sons of Haman. Well, that's another edict. It's passive voice. It's interesting. So I don't know who issued the edict. It's almost like at this point, the author of Esther is like, do I even need to clarify how these edicts happen anymore? Let's just use passive voice instead of saying the king wrote an edict or Mordecai wrote an edict in the name of the king. Let's just call it what it is. They're kind of like executive orders post 2000. The edict just happens and these things occur. So now let's picture what the landscape of Sousa looks like. Presumably the gallows that has Haman on it has been taken down by now. I mean, that was quite a while ago. I mean, what months have passed? I don't know. I saw an example just this week on a history website of some dudes who were almost mummified in the ancient and medieval world. There's a certain people group that when they hung somebody up there to make a point at the gate, like this is what happens to the enemies of the king. They would treat them with a certain concoction that would cause them to last longer up there. Some of that treatment was so good that some of these people who were displayed on walls to make a point are still pretty much intact. This is getting gross. I'm sorry. I'll try to remember to go back and put a content warning on the beginning of this one. You know, this violent, dark stuff is what it is, I guess. So maybe Haman is still up there. I don't know. But now on day two of this political violence in the Capitol, the 10 sons are up there as well. It's like a little skyline of dead people to send a message to everybody that you don't want to be on that side. And it says then in verse 15, the Jews and Susa came together on the 14th day of the month of the Dar and they put to death in Susa 300 men. And now we're up to 800. And here's this clarification again, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. Okay. So the author of Esther is taking a moral stand and how they're describing this very violent, very ugly time. The moral stand though is not Esther shouldn't have killed those people and the Jews shouldn't have killed those people. No, obviously to the author that you should have done this, but they didn't plunder. This is holy war. They're not there to get rich. They're not there to get politically ahead in a financial gamesmanship kind of way. This seems to be meant to communicate that something very different was at stake. So the end of the purge is carried out. The king approves. At this point, it's almost like it's out of the hands of the king and stuff is just happening. And then we read on verse 16. Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king's provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They killed 75,000 of them, but did not lay their hands on the plunder. And that's it. That's the account. We don't get any more grisly details. We can speculate about how it all fit together. But what we see is three components to the combination of all of these edicts that came together from the side of the Jews. One, you get to defend yourselves. And now because of Haman's original edict, you know exactly who to defend yourselves against do is you please go win. That's the commissioning. All bets are off. Go win. Thing number two, there's a different type of violence in the capital. This looks more like the historic political purges that we've talked about. And one day proves simply not to be enough time to get that done. There are no ongoing second day political purges out in the countryside and around the empire. One, because logistically you just couldn't get the message out in time. And two, because it probably wasn't needed. Those people didn't have the most valuable asset in all of the world at this time, which as we've discussed is access to King Xerxes and his flippant sloppy decision making processes. The only real threat politically for this to happen again was all found within the same zip code as the palace in SUSA. And so logistically you could get the message out to people fast enough there to say we're not done. And also that's where the actual remaining threat was. The message was probably received after one day out and about on the countryside, but two days in the estimation of Esther from a very pragmatic point of view were needed to eliminate all of the enemies of the Jews who might take up this cause in the near future, seeking revenge within the citadel of SUSA. 75,000 people die in the larger operation around the empire. And in the political purge of the enemies of the Jews in SUSA itself, 500 men die on the first day, 300 men die on the second day. The text doesn't speak to women and children. And again, the author of the text views this as a complete win, a total victory and suggests that Esther and Mordecai have secured the future of the people against this very real threat that had intended to eliminate them entirely. Next time around, we're going to find out why all of these details are recorded. We're going to learn a little something about why the author of the book is spelling all of this out and giving us these timelines instead of just saying the 13th day of the 12th month of a dark came and the edict was carried out and the Jews won the end. There's actually a practical reason for all of this. And tomorrow when we get into that, it's going to be so much lighter. And I'm ready for that. Okay, I'm Matt.
