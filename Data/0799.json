We're talking about what happened after Matthew. I think we got one more day on that. And then tomorrow we're going to do our final official day on Matthew. And we're in the midst of this amazing story in the book of Acts that quickly addresses the problem. And we're talking about like no time after Jesus is held out as ascending into heaven. We got, we got this question, like, how's this all going to work out? And that problem is very quickly addressed in Acts chapter two. Now you're paying attention going through the book of Matthew. You know this problem, the problem being the world is a very big place and people believe in lots of gods and they don't really believe in our God or in Jesus. A lot of people don't speak our language and like we're an occupied people right now. Jesus aren't going super well. How like, how is the whole world? This is, you say it's for everybody, new family faith goes beyond the boundaries of our people group. How exactly is that going to work out even though Jesus, you do really cool miracles and stuff. That's awesome. Don't get me wrong. But how, how on earth is this supposed to play out? Put yourself in the shoes of the disciples in the time period we're looking at Jesus is back to life. But even in chapter 28, they worship them, they fall at his feet and they clasp his feet and stuff. And they're all glad that he's like back obviously and that he's restoring them. And then calling them brothers, even though they totally ditched him. Obviously, they're thankful for that. But says some of them still doubted. We know one of them by name, Thomas specifically doubted. I think Matthew is indicating in that little verse I just referenced it. Maybe kind of everybody was a little bit. And then what does Jesus do with their doubt? He just doesn't even acknowledge it. He's like, yeah, I got all authority on heaven and earth. You've seen everything you need to see in order to know that. So I want you to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you. And I'll be with you always until the end of the age. The end, that's it. There you go. That's Matthew. That's what you're going to do. Imagine being one of those guys, especially imagine being one of those guys after Jesus flies into heaven like we see at the beginning of Acts. I think you're going to be a little nervous about this. Imagine if you had to go and change the whole world right now from where you are right now. Like, what are you doing right now? You working out? Are you cleaning your house? Are you commuting somewhere? Are you just kind of in between stuff? Zone and out, playing a little game on your phone, just feet propped up after work or something. Are you blowing off work right now? Are you like doing one of those super long bathroom breaks? Hey, that's fine. That can be between us. No judgment. Wherever you are right now, imagine that the next thing you need to do is go and somehow change all of planet earth for at least the next 2000 years. What's your strategy? Oh, yeah. And you're not allowed to kill people. You got to do it with these values of peace and grace and stuff. How are you going to do it? What are you going to do? It's intimidating, right? That's okay. It's intimidating to me too. I don't know what I would do. It's too big. It's too much stuff. But if a guy who could fly and come back from the grave and walk on water and calm storms and make flesh grow back out of non flesh and things like that was like, I know it's intimidating but I'm going to be with you always to the end of the age and I have the authority to say this with truth. I would be somewhat reassured, still wobbly, but reassured. Then these guys wait around for a little while wondering how on earth is this ever going to work out? We're like 11 dudes huddled in an attic somewhere. There's some ladies here and we just hired a new guy. I don't really know much about him yet. I hope it works out great. We just picked him with straws and then you get into Acts chapter two, you get into the next day and boom, there's your answer. The answer is God has ordained that this family of faith is happening. The answer is that though God incarnate Jesus of Nazareth is no longer physically present, God is with you always till the end of the age and with you in a way that is different and even more intimate than what it was like when you were with Jesus in the flesh. This is next level stuff here with the Holy Spirit. And I say again, if that question about that union between an infinite God and you somehow being induelped by the Holy Spirit, a kingdom citizen is a lot to take in. I get it. I mean, fortunately, there's a lot of Bible left to help us think that through and God willing we will get to that given a little bit of time. No, the big conundrum is how will this be? Same question Mary asked. Same question that a lot of the patriarchs asked, back in Genesis when God was making promises to them, how will it be? Yeah, with God, all things are possible. That's more or less it. God has ordained it. He has willed it. He will see the thing through. And part of the beauty of it is apparently he's going to use very flawed people. He's going to afford them the greatest honor that a king could afford, which is to call these people daughter or son and to give them responsibility in the building and the maintenance and the defense and the growth and the administration of his kingdom. That's pretty cool. So we come out of this day of Pentecost and now we have an answer. Now we can at least picture the road map and the game plan for how this is going to work out. And it looks like starting from there in chapter three, the disciples are like, okay, get it now. I know what to do. And church tradition coupled with what we get in the book of Acts and a few details we can pick out of some of the letters that come later on in the New Testament tells us that the guys just went and got after it. And they went to places where they had particular interest. Now Peter and John James, they're on screen quite a bit in the book of Acts, but even Peter fades into the background about halfway through the book of Acts. He has a big important vision that we'll talk about some other time and Paul, somebody who never met Jesus in the flesh, at least not the way the disciples did in the gospels. Paul an enemy who is an extension and an outgrowth of the anger and continuing boiling turmoil coming from the tension between the religious leaders and the disciples who will not let the religious leaders nor Jerusalem forget that they killed Jesus the Messiah. Paul is going around persecuting Christians, maybe killing him, but he has an encounter with risen Jesus and he's transformed on his way to go kill people. And he comes around and all of a sudden he's the greatest advocate for Christianity. And so now we learn more about what the game plan is for how this is all going to work out long term. It turns out that there's going to be a generation two of people who are followers of Jesus who never met him in the flesh the same way the disciples did. Well, Paul reaches people and mentors people like say Timothy and then we find out there's going to be a generation three. And now we're starting to see it. He has a family of faith, different people in this family are positioned to do different things and play different roles and contribute in different ways to the advancement of the kingdom to the glory of God. Those are the big themes that the text holds out as being kind of what this unfolding is about. It's a straightening out of things. It's the redemption of creation for the glory of God and all these different people with all these different skill sets, some of which are very modest, all have this role to play. It's frankly a beautiful vision that we see unfolding here and the chief adversary to all of it in a physical sense, you know, worldly sense. It's just the world kingdom. There's a set of assumptions that seem to work for people that are based on naturalism and the compellingness of this kingdom for some, it's threatening and there's a friction that goes with it. We've talked before about how the temple got destroyed in 70 AD. That's obviously a pretty big what happened next kind of detail. The clamps got tightened down tighter by the Roman overlords. After that, they were a lot less amused by the tettate and the back and forth they were having with the temple leadership and then somewhere in the first couple of decades of the second century, there's another significant revolt, the Barcocca revolt. And after Rome smashes that one in a manner that ends in a fantastically memorable, violent way, Judea is stripped of being a client king state. It's stripped of its status. It is reorganized and really never regains any meaningful semblance of independence for a very, very, very long time and the temple system and the religious leadership in general. I mean, they didn't know it when Jesus was saying this stuff and when they were having him killed, but they had less than a century of existence as they knew it left in them. And then effectively they became a different organization, scattered and forced to operate in a very different way without a physical temple anymore. In other words, the place where God dwelt among the people according to the Old Testament. Well, if you're not with Jesus in the fulfillment of that Old Testament, where does he dwell now? The temple is gone. But in Christ, the idea is God with us, God dwells among us. How? We just looked in Acts chapter two, like the Holy Spirit for those who are part of the family of faith, the temple of God becomes you. The holy of holies is inside the kingdom citizen again, very confusing language, big picture stuff overwhelming even. But that's kind of how the whole thing ends up shaking out. I think the last detail I want to tie up has to do with the guy who walked us through the story, is Matthew our friend. What happened to him? I wish we had a clearer picture, but we don't. In keeping with the impulse of all of the disciples coming out of the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter two, it looks like he went out and did stuff, talked to people. There's some confusion geographically about where he went because it looks like there were two Ethiopia's in the ancient world. And I don't think Matthew likely went to the Ethiopia that we think of today as being in Africa. I think he went to somewhere that had a similar sounding name that was in old Medo-Persian territory, maybe near the Caspian Sea. More of the tradition seems to suggest that he went there. There's one ancient tradition that says that he lived out his days in the company of the Medes and the Persians, what was left of them, the people of Parsus, I guess, at this point in history is what they would have been called. And that he communicated the values of the kingdom there and that people responded. There is a remnant of Christianity there that dates all the way back to effectively the very, very, very, very beginning of everything and the existence of these Christians and how they practice would support the idea that this is indeed where Matthew went. I have to admit, I find it really fascinating that most of the traditions surrounding Matthew have him going to old Medo-Persian territory and Matthew is the only guy who tells us about the wise men from the East, the Magi. Magi was effectively Daniel's job in the court of the Neo-Babylonians and in the court of the Persians who came thereafter. That little detail right there further cements in my mind that those traditions that have Matthew going East, modern day Iran, old school Persia, to me that checks out the best. Now, only one tradition says that he lived out his life. Everybody else agrees that he died of martyr. Exactly what the means of his execution was debated. They're conflicting sources on that. So it's kind of a great big who knows. But I think there's enough support and agreement to say Matthew was transformed by what he saw. He was transformed by all of this. He got called from that booth and Jesus was like, yeah, come follow me now. He's like, okay, I work for you now. Here we go. And he was changed in an instant. He threw that party. He invited other people to be changed in an instant. What was Matthew's first instinct? It was, whoa, that's the king. He's the real deal and other people need to hear about this. That's the first thing we see from him on screen and all the traditions surrounding Matthew our friend who we've been spending all this time with supports that that impulse never went away. That's what he did with it to the very, very end of things tomorrow. Our last conversation in this epilogue about the book of Matthew, I want to consider what we do with this encounter.
