And I know there are some of you who listen to this, who live in Israel and Jerusalem, and you see stuff where the Bible definitely happened all the time. And so for you, it's the equivalent of me seeing Mount Rushmore. Literally every time somebody comes to town. And it's like, hey, you know, it shows around a little bit. Oh, we're going to Mount Rushmore. And it's really cool. And it's like a modern wonder of the world, but also I live right by it. And I see it a lot. So I get that for some reason, not that big a deal to see places where the Bible happened, but for me, living in the American West, it's amazing after a long journey to go to this place and picture it and feel the humidity or lack thereof in the air to feel the seasonal temperatures to smell it, to look around and be like, oh, this is what those characters would have seen in all directions from here. Fascinating. The story just comes alive. And so I love these places that are very specifically described in the Bible and where you can still go and be like, oh, you know, this is exactly it. This is exactly where this character was standing. And that's what we get here in Esther chapter two as we get this story about Mordecai. Sitting at the King's Gate in Susa, you can still go to this spot. If you have the right passport, I don't get to go see things that are in Iran because that isn't somewhere Americans get to travel right now. I do know someone who is an American and had the opportunity to go and travel a whole bunch in Iran and came back with pictures of the tomb of Cyrus and stuff from Susa. And someday things are going to be in such a place that I am able to do it and I absolutely cannot wait because I love this era in history. I love the overlap with Bible stuff. And this is the passage that has me thinking about it right here. Okay, you'll recall you get this banquet for Esther. And at the end of it, it says that when the virgins were assembled a second time Mordecai was sitting at the King's Gate, but Esther kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do for she continued to follow Mordecai's instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up. Next thing, verse 21, during the time Mordecai was sitting at the King's Gate, bigthnot and Tarrish, two of the King's officers who guarded the doorway became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. We're going to get into the whole story and how this plays out in just a minute. But you'll recall that we talked about the back and forth, the reflective nature of this story. And so Esther's banquet is sort of a deflection reflection echo of Vashti's banquet. And in the same way that there was danger at the end of this beautiful banquet for Vashti. So we would then as trained readers who were picking up on the rhythms of Esther, we would expect there to be danger at the back end of Esther's banquet as well. There is more on that in future conversations. But for now, I just got to stop and appreciate that we know exactly where this happened and that you could go and sit there today. Again, if you happen to have the right passport. Now as I understand it from reading the work of people who are way smarter than me, this expression sitting at the King's Gate has a double meaning. It literally means that Mordecai was sitting at a place called the King's Gate that provided access to the part of Susa where the King's palace was at. That palace had been almost entirely developed by Darius. He threw a ton of money at Susa in the previous administration to the one we're looking at here of Xerxes. So it means one literally just sitting at the King's Gate. But it probably also means that Mordecai had some kind of role in the legal system because at this time all kinds of inquiries for the King and judicial cases would have started at the King's Gate. Somebody would go there with an appeal with a thing. I need to see the King, whatever. But obviously you're not going to let everybody in. Most of the stuff is going to be stupid and it's going to be easily handled by somebody who just knows how to deal with the FAQ for Persia. Okay, Ralph, I know you want to talk to the King. But let's see if any of these simple Q&As here might answer your question. So we wouldn't want to bother the great King with something simple. There were people who probably did that and it looks like the author is suggesting to us that Mordecai was one of these people who had some sort of role. He wasn't just loitering is the point. He was probably doing something there. But back to the site of SUSA today in modern day Iran, SUSA is not glorious now. I mean, as we talked about the other day, it's a city built on top of the city, built on top of the city, built on top of the city, going back into time practically immemorial to the primeval stuff, getting way, way back there in history. And unfortunately, the city has not stood the test of time. And significant excavations happened starting in the 19th century and into the mid 20th century. And as a result, we get a pretty good sense of the layout of this city during the reign of Darius and Xerxes. The palace has been discovered and reestablished and we have even found and we had nothing to do with this other people who are interested in the same things that I'm interested in who are now dead, figured out where the gate was and about what the dimensions of this grand king's gate would have been. Now, this gate wasn't just decorative though apparently it resembled the famous king's gate. I don't think they called it the king's gate, but it served the same purpose in the other capital of Persepolis, which we still have preserved it to some extent. And it stones and color and it was huge. And apparently it led into this grand entryway where you could pick a couple of directions to turn. And it was through this gate that you could get to the actual king's court, the place of greatest influence and import in this entire world. And of course, very few of the people who came to this gate would ever get through it. But if you did, we can see I'm looking at it right now. I'm looking at pictures of this. You can see the pathway that you would go in through the gate. You can see this long hallway that no doubt would have been adorned with all kinds of art reminding you of how close you are to the center of great, great power. And then when you got to the end of this, it looks like things would open up. I'm kind of scrolling here into this big sprawling royal court. It's pretty impressive even with just the foundations in place. And speaking of foundations, there is an inscription here. And I don't think I have, I don't think I have what it says in front of me, but I've seen this inscription a whole bunch of times. It says more or less that this was built by Darius, the achaemenid and that it was improved or fixed up by Xerxes, his son. At least that's what we can deduce from the inscription is that one generation after the building of this thing, it was apparently a little bit wobbly and needed some repairs. And Xerxes is the one who did that. So who knows? Maybe those repairs and the clinking of hammers and everything were going on in the background while Mordecai is sitting here at the gate and all of this stuff is going on. The timeline seems to add up pretty tightly there. It's pretty cool too. There was a statue made out of rock that is native to Egypt of Darius that got dug up there in the early 1970s. Now it's in the National Museum of Iran and Tehran again. So I haven't been there. I can't see it. A lot of these other artifacts are in Paris and the British Museum as well. But this particular statue of Darius, which sadly lacks the head, shows him portrayed in sort of an Egyptian style and it's got hieroglyphics on the bottom. I don't remember what they said and I didn't think to look it up for you. I'm sure it says something like Darius, king of Persia. But he was very connected to Egypt. I think it's cool that we've got that kind of a sculpture there that demonstrate the Egyptian connections because one of the other big stories that we have about stuff happening at the city gates of Susa from the ancient world outside of Esther is from Herodotus who tells us about this guy named Silason who encountered Darius when he was still a nobody in Egypt. It says when Cambysus, the son of Cyrus was marching upon Egypt, many Helene's, Greeks arrived in Egypt. Some as might be expected joining in the campaign and among them was this guy named Silason who was from Samos, who's an exile and Silason had this super fancy coat, this mantle and it was flame colored. Darius sees the coat while they're both wandering around in the market and they meet by chance. It says at this point, Darius was just a spearman for King Cambyses and Darius presumptuously is like, I'd like your coat. What can I pay you for it? And Silason for whatever reason is like, just take it, man. And just remember me. That's kind of odd. Well, later Darius, of course, goes on to become the king of everything and Silason shows up at the gates of Sousa says accordingly, he went up to Sousa and sat down at the great entrance of the king's palace and said that he was a benefactor of Darius. The keeper of the door, depending on how late in his reign this happened was that maybe Mordecai was Mordecai maybe sitting right there. This sounds like one of the officials who sits at the gate of the king just like Mordecai. The keeper of the door hearing this reported it to the king and he marveled at it and said to him and it doesn't matter. After that point, it sets in motion a thing where the king receives the guy and offers him a bunch of gold and Silason is like, no, I want you to help me take my island home back that I've been exiled from. And so Darius agrees to sweep the island clear of all of the people who exiled him and Silason gets set up as the owner of this island. And I guess that's why you want to be nice to people. You're pretty sure are going to be king later on. And the point is the way the gate of Sousa looks from archeology, the way it is described in the book of Esther, the way it is described in the histories of Herodotus, it all adds up to give us a really vivid picture of not just what this looked like, but what happened at this gate and how influential and important a place it was. It really was a very significant court of power just outside the actual court of power. Again, undergirding that idea that proximity to the king and his influence was the most powerful, most valuable thing that existed in the Persian world. So I think that's super cool. I think it's super cool that you can see pictures of what's left of this thing. I think it's super cool that if you're allowed to go to Iran, you can walk in there, you can count the paces for what it would look like to get in there. You can imagine what it was like for these different characters to be moving around the palace as we unwrap the story of all the palace intrigue happening here throughout the rest of the book of Esther. This is cool that we know the setting of this particular story. And if you're able, you could physically go there and kind of feel the rhythms of the setting of this story that much better. Okay. Next time around, we're going to talk about what actually happened sitting there at the gate. I think it's pretty interesting stuff. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
