I didn't see the title. There's a little girl on the screen there and she's got a bow and arrow and down range. She's got one of those old school concentric circle targets and I'm like, well, I hit the proposition is obvious. Can that little girl draw that bow and hit that target? I'm looking at them thinking, I bet I could at least hit the target at that range. I'm not real good at archery or anything, but I've fired several of those. I bet I could hit the target. Let's see if she does better. Then she proceeds to bring out this little pommel horse kind of thing and put her hands on it. I'm like, oh, kiddo, you're doing it all wrong. You're going to need those for shooting the bow and arrow here in a second. Then she stands up on there with her hands. The smaller of her back now is facing the target. She does this scorpion move with her feet where she picks up the bow and the arrow with their toes and knocks the arrow and draws it with the one foot and aims with the other foot. While standing on her hands upside down, she proceeds to bullseye that target with her feet. I couldn't help but think to myself, I don't know if I could do that. The video would have been cool if she's shot an arrow and was like, hey, shot an arrow and I hit the thing and that's great. But the video was remarkable and I remembered to tell you about it because she stacked the deck against herself. She made an extra double triple super ridiculously hard so that the whole setup was there and at that moment that she knocks the arrow and starts to aim. You're like, uh, that's a pretty bold move. Let's see if you can deliver on it and then she does and it's all the more impressive because of the setup. Likewise throughout the Bible, we get all kinds of situations where the God character in the text doesn't seem content to be like, I'm God and I can do amazing things. He seems to want to demonstrate that he can do whatever he wants and is completely unlimited in power, unlimited by human expectations or what people consider to be normal. And so we'll see him stack the deck against himself. Maybe the most famous just example is the one that involved the prophet Elijah back in first Kings 18 where you get the prophets of Baal. There's this horrible king of Israel named ahab and his horrible wife Jezebel. That's where we get the term Jezebel because of how she acted and everything. And then Elijah is like, let's have a God off. How about Baal versus actual God? We're going to meet on Mount Carmel. That's a good place for these kinds of events. And we're going to need two bulls out there and we're going to see which God will consume the bull with fire. And the prophets of Baal get to go first. And you guys can have 400 prophets because that's how many you have. But the real God he just has the one right now. And so I will all handle things on the other side. And then the prophets of Baal come out and they march around and they cut themselves and they yell and they groan and Elijah kind of makes front of him. He's like, yeah, yell louder, maybe your God is pooping or taking a nap. Paraphrase is mine, but it's not even really that much of a paraphrase. That's the kind of stuff he's saying to him. And in the end, all they get is really cut up and no burned bull. And so then Elijah is like, cool. All right, let's do this thing. But first, let's make it harder. Dump a bunch of water on that altar and make sure you drench that wood good and plenty. He does all this stuff to make it even harder for fire from heaven to consume the bull. And then of course, God sends fire from heaven to consume the bull and then things get crazy after that. Likewise number two for this episode here in Matthew 27, right at the end as we get ready to go into 28, it feels like Matthew is doing the same thing that he's saying to anybody would have questions about this. Hey, let's just give you all the details of the story here so that we dump as much water on this metaphorical altar as possible. Let's make sure that the wood we're trying to start this metaphorical fire with is completely drenched so that there can be no question as to what is going on here when Jesus is raised to life is completely vindicated and the religious leaders are exposed for being frauds who are not connected with the God they say they are able to connect people with. So Matthew is bending over backwards much like the girl in that video to make it super clear Jesus is really, really dead. Professional executioner has vouched for it. That is implicitly stated in Matthew explicitly stated in other gospel accounts in the New Testament. Further, we've got a member of the Sanhedrin coming forward. I mean, it looks like that's who it is. That's what his job is anyway. This Joseph of Arimathea fellow and he's talking with pilot pilots not going to give him the body of an alive man, especially given the concerns of the day. Joseph of Arimathea is collecting a dead body. That body is being prepared in front of witnesses and that dead body is being buried in a tomb with the big heavy rock that rolls in front, which isn't something you're going to want to do if you're burying somebody who's alive. Then as we talked about yesterday, the religious leaders are going to show up and they're going to confirm further that Jesus is dead. Matthew is doing a very clever thing here. He's saying the neutral party, you can call him neutral pilot. He feels like he's the clown king in this scenario. He's just getting played by all sides. Mockery of authority, which is a motif we've talked about a lot that it runs through the whole Bible. Then you've got the good guys, of course, vouching for the reality of Jesus death, that being Joseph of Arimathea and according to the book of John Nicodemus as well. Then you've got the bad guys even agreeing. He's totally dead. It's kind of like the discovery phase in a trial where we get all the facts out on the table and we figure out all the things we agree on. All parties can agree. He's definitely dead. Okay, great. Matthew is leaving no room for doubt as to the situation and as to how impossible it would be for the disciples to break in their and steal a body, to fake a resurrection or for Jesus to just shake it off, I guess, and get better from crucified. And be like, man, I'm unassphyxiated now. That's weird. I'm not bled out now. I just made a lot more blood and I'm actually feeling a ton better. Nope, definitely dead. Definitely no chance of him getting out of there, even if he were to recover, which can't happen because he's dead. And further, the Pharisees unwittingly help stack the deck even more against God so that it will be even more impressive and conclusive when this resurrection does occur because they petition Pontius Pilate to put a guard at the tomb and Pontius Pilate agrees. That's right here in 2765. Take a guard, Pilate answered. Go make the tomb as secure as you know how. So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard. So the deck is stacked even further against the possibility of resurrection now at the behest of the Pharisees who got permission. Technically, you said as secure as we knew how. So we got guards, we have people watching it. We're also going to seal the tomb. What would the seal have looked like? I don't totally know, but I assume it would be the kind of thing where if you messed with it, people would be able to tell that the seal had been broken. Kind of like what they used to do with phones, whereas like if you get in here and you cut this little piece of tape, then the manufacturer would know you were messing with it and you're not allowed to mess with it. That voids the warranty. Maybe it's that kind of deal where you've got some kind of wax seal or something here that you just can't cobble back together once it's broken. It's broken. Maybe there's more clarity on that in the other gospels and I just don't remember it. But what we've got coming out of Matthew 27 is an incredible setup. Either this thing is going to spectacularly fall on its face and the whole Jesus thing is going to look absolutely idiotic and ridiculous. Or this thing is going to head toward awesome, though. And everybody is going to need to take a moment to either reject this on some grounds or rethink everything you know about life, death, God, eternity, the point of everything, meaning in life, relationships, ethics, values, hope, time, you know, little stuff like that. The stage is set, the deck is stacked, the die is cast. This is building to an inarguable pivot point in the story that will looking backwards either completely validate everything we've seen about Jesus or completely undermine everything we've seen about Jesus. We got high stake stuff here. I'm telling you, if we turn it over to chapter 28 a couple days from now and it turns out that he's dead, you just wasted like second 800 episodes times 10. They're never actually 10 minutes long, 8000. So let's just round that up. 9000. You just wasted like 9000 minutes of your life. Jokes on you, but it's not on you because I mean, he's, he's, it turns out he's going to come back to life in the next one. Home stretch, my friends. Chapter 28 starts tomorrow. I'm Matt.
