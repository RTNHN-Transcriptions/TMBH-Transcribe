about a hundred fifty years after the king we've been talking about the book of Esther Xerxes about a hundred fifty years after he was done with things is great great great great great grandson something like that i was a lot of great says suppose he comes along and he's effectively the last ruler the last kiminid ruler of purgia his name is darius as well it's darius the third and he gets in a fight with alexander the great alexander massed on and we talked about alexander the great a whole bunch and there's so many interesting little snippets about how that march of conquest ended up working out so alexander he locks horns for the first time with darius the third at the battle of isis and we know a lot about how this battle went down is pretty well documented the ancient historian plutarch tells us a bunch about the life of alexander the way things ended up playing out is darius falls over the front of his chariot and his pants come up over the top of them and he looks like a fool and he flees the battlefield and he leaves his family behind no joke what is that say what would it take for you to do that this pretty dark so alexander according to plutarch after the battle he's going to figure out what did i just win because when you beat somebody in the ancient world may when you beat somebody now you get their stuff there's a reversal that occurs reversals like what we've been seeing in the book of ester there's a an expectation that now you're the conqueror you're the owner of whatever was there so alexander's going through the baggage train and according to plutarch he says to himself of all of the gold and silver and all of the fancy stuff for bathing and self-care he says wow this it seems is royalty he is delighted with things and as he's getting all set up to take a fragrant bath with all of the spices and nice bathing equipment post-battle the darius left when fleeing he gets word that they found darius's family his wife and his daughter and his mom who were all left behind with all of the royal baggage and wealth so it would seem that we're getting an even bigger reversal and even bigger conquest now here's the deal we're about to learn a lot about alexander when we get to this point in the story because of alexander we're going on some sort of revenge march well he's gonna he's gonna torch things and kill people and he's gonna inflict harm on the family of his enemy if he's simply going on a march of conquest well that's different it's not personal i just won all your stuff look i don't think either those things are terribly moral and i don't recommend doing any of this but i'm telling you the story for the reason because it's it's a disaster we're gonna get a stir here and it's all gonna make sense so they go and uh... alexander in his right hand man they meet the family uh... darius and they the family falls at the feet of the right hand man of alexander because i guess he was a little taller he looked a bit more noble and then they're like uh... no we blew it we violated royal protocol now we're really in trouble but alexander has a laugh about it is like now it's it's okay you know i i can see it yeah he's pretty impressive but i'm actually the king and it's nice to meet all of you and here's what you need to know there's a little bit of paraphrasing going on here but this gets right to the heart of what plutarch tells us about it he says i'm not gonna harm any of you you're all safe you'll be treated like royalty because you are royalty that's irrevocable and he reassures them by saying quote darius is not dead and then he lets them know that according to plutarch they need not fear for any harm from alexander who was making war upon darius only for dominion they should themselves be provided with everything they had been used to receiving from darius and then alexander lets them bury their dead and everything else and gradually he really comes to enjoy talking with the hyper intelligent mother of darius the third who is a shrewd sophisticated woman and he comes to hold her in very high regard he doesn't exactly hit it off with darius's wife who i believe was pregnant at the time and eventually after he had completely defeated darius the third alexander ends up marrying one of his daughters that becomes alexander's second of three wives why am i telling you all of this well because it's a really good story and it kind of gives us a little bit of an idea of how everything plays out in the grand history of persia but also because there's a conquest reversal that happens here and over time alexander treats the family of darius so well that he even offers to let them go back to darius darius offers to pay to get them back he's like no you don't have to pay we'll just let them go back if they want to go back and they're all like no we get treated better here and i think the chances of us being left behind with the baggage while our benefactor fleas is far less with alexander than it is with you darius the third so they're still pretty mad about getting left behind at isis and ultimately darius loses to alexander again at the battle of gogamela and dies shortly thereafter and alexander sort of adopts darius's family he fashions himself as the king of persia the king of kings in a sense he takes the baton as the achaemenid ruler of persia even though he's a massadonia not that weird because as we've discussed there's a lot of overlap between greek culture and persian culture but one of the takeaways of the ancient author really wants the original audience to understand to get how complete alexander's victory over darius the third was is to understand that he not only got all of his stuff he not only got his kingdom but he got the loyalty of his family total reversal alexander takes the place of darius the third now those events being described are happening roughly in the same cultural generational ballpark with the same sensibilities as the era we're looking at here in the book of ester and it would seem that the author of ester felt the same compulsion to really let the audience know that hey as you think of conquest this is total conquest mortikai and ester have completely defeated haman he is gone the threat of him is totally eliminated because all of the resources that haman had at his disposal of the relationships everything they are either gone or transferred to mortikai and ester in a complete and total ancient world victory in the fashion of the later alexander the great over darius the third this is how the description of that total conquest reads in ester eight verse one that same day king zirksis gave queen ester the estate of haman the enemy of the jews and mortikai came into the presence of the king for ester had told how he was related to her the king took off his signet ring which he had reclaimed from haman and presented it to mortikai and ester appointed him over haman's state we've obviously got a lot more to talk about in terms of the implications of this for the story we've also got to talk about why there are more pages to the book of ester it feels like we're done here everything worked out but there is still a grand tension that exists that we'll start talking about next time around but first i just want to pause to appreciate that in our context there would be certain indicators to say this was a total victory for party a and a total humiliation for party b party a is no longer in any way threatened by party b everyone sees that party a is the complete and total winner and a sense to this new reality and no one is still holding out a case for party b there are things in our culture that would communicate that kind of total victory that we speak in our cultural language movies over the decades have tried to capture that moment think about marty mcfly defeating biff and all of a sudden the girls don't like biff anymore and he's covered in poop and he looks like a big dumb idiot and he's not going to be bullying anybody anymore well that defeat the bully humiliate them ha ha ha ha ha you got poop on you and the pretty girls don't like you anymore that was a good way to communicate total victory in sort of a high school mindset in the 1980s you get what i'm driving at we know from within the bible and from extra biblical texts what total personal victory over arrival looked like and what expectations would be associated with that in the era of the achaemenid Persian empire and the author of the book of ester is going out of their way to say that complete and total victory has occurred here we'll break down more about what that means next time around quick note i saw that for whatever reason of late a bunch of you have needed to tap out on the patreon support thing that is totally cool and i think it's really important from time to time for me to just remind you hey there's no expectation that that's a forever thing thank you so much for carrying the baton while you did that is absolutely awesome and sometimes when you do something like that or you work with somebody on a certain thing in a certain way for a while and then doesn't make sense anymore you just i mean you can't do it just life happens or whatever it can feel like uh now there's there's weirdness there ain't weirdness all i feel is gratitude for you helping to make this thing happen for the time that you did thank you so very very much for that thanks to everybody who makes this happen by supporting the program now or ever has i'm just so grateful to all of you have done that at any point thank you it means the world i love doing this and you're the reason that we get to so i was hyper appreciated all right now i think that's enough
