world war two is about fighting come on i think we've talked about this before i keep on to say the league of extraordinary gentleman but that wasn't it that was horrible at shan carrie is like twenty years ago in the league of extraordinary gentleman they sailed a five hundred foot long submarine through the narrow twisting turning canals of venice that was an even my biggest problem with it wasn't that it wasn't the league of the it's like the exceptional un-genome and leave war fighters warriors and re-caville senate set in world war two and there's bullets and people get shot and it's cute it's trying to be funny and quirky i was fine it's okay movie but i'll tell you what didn't work about it for me is there was just no problem the all the team the super squad of fighter warriors they were all real good at things and they all had talents the same talent that every roster has in movies like that you get the demolition guy and you got the technology guy you got the gun fighter guy and you get the bruiser and you got the beauty it was just exactly what you'd expect but was weird about this movie is they just never had any problem whatsoever everywhere they walked into their like a now we will win and then they just won and we need this thing to work out or we're all gonna die and then the thing worked out is fine you get to the end and you feel like like us guess i was it that was no fun at all and he did the bad guys to be more competent and that their thing is so good you would expect given the rhythms and paces of storytelling that there would be an equal and opposite thing that is so bad and they're gonna have to eke out a victory over it but the incredible league of un-gentlemenly exceptional extraordinary henry calvall war fighter gun world war two warrior fighters was just anti-climactic it was way too easy and maybe the first time somebody's reading through the book of acts you might be tempted to think that it's going to be like that you're just going to cruise to victory this is so easy jesus is there right at the beginning he says the holy spirits gonna show up and the holy spirit shows up and breaks the laws of time and space and a whole bunch of people immediately convert then right after that peter and john to the people are gonna be the linchpins and whether or not this thing works out they're afraid of anything john is very young peter is made big mistakes but doesn't matter there and face to they just go right back into the place where all the enemies are who just got done killing their buddy jesus and they're like we're totally associated with him and just a huge amount of character growth on the part of peter by the way from when he was denying jesus just a few weeks earlier now he's like big and bold and out in public i follow jesus i'm here and here's what you need to know and further y'all got a bunch of stuff wrong but that's okay because this was all designed by god for the message of forgiveness and redemption and god's redemptive plan and the establishment of the kingdom of god to happen and they be he'll have crippled guys being crippled since birth and everybody sees it and it just it looks like maybe this thing is just gonna be completely cake all the way down is the easiest simplest thing ever but this is a good story and good stories but great brave bold ideas on a collision course with somewhat equal and somewhat opposite bad ideas this new thing that is the message of jesus is heading for yet another showdown with the religious status quo and that's what happens over the next few chapters of the book of acts the religious leaders same people killed jesus they find out what peter and john were saying stuff we talked about yesterday and they don't like it of course they don't like it and they're like well we're just gonna arrest them now theoretically these guys couldn't just go around arresting everybody all the time and killing people but they were sort of tugging at the leash of their roman overlords you know they tried their hand it's sewing the seeds of violence with the jesus thing it kind of seemed like they got away with it so who's to say maybe they'll do something more violent and see if rome puts a stop to it's they going to rest peter and john and they bring them in before the high priest which is pretty big honor to be i mean must be a serious problem to be brought in before the high priest this is not a little thing don't underestimate this title they ask peter and john a question like hey by what power are you doing this that's funny that they're asking again they're really obsessed with this question because over in the book of matthew that's one of the questions that when jesus wrote into jereusalam they hit him with hey by whose authority are you saying this stuff are you doing these things jesus fires back at them like well okay well the baptism that john the baptist did was that from man or was that from god and all the religious leaders are like oh that is a tough question because either way we answer we're going to get in trouble with people so they huddle up and they think about it and they come back and they're like we don't know and jesus is like cool then neither will i tell you by what authority i do these things so it's kind of funny that that thread is still hanging out there from before the crucifixion and now the same religious leaders are going to revisit that with jesus followers peter and john and we have where to get the power to this outcome how do you have the authority to do that by whose name are you doing this stuff and then it says then peter filled with the holy spirit said to them rulers and elders of the people if we're being called to account today for an active kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed then know this you and all the people of israel it is by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified but whom god raised from the dead that this man stands before you healed any every chapter that goes by we're seeing peter get better and better at this and he immediately goes to an old testament references on one eighteen peter says he that is jesus is the stone you builders rejected which has become the capstone and then here's a doozy acts for twelve peter remember this is the same peter who fled into the night because somebody said don't you know jesus peter who now apparently has no fear whatsoever and is a completely transformed man says salvation is found in no one else for there's no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved he's made an exclusive claim what he's saying is nobody is going to be saved through the old stuff the stuff that jesus has fulfilled the law that you religious leaders represent it is only by the name of jesus it is only through the work of jesus that there is deliverance that there is forgiveness of sin that there is eternal life that there is reunion with god that there is a tone meant well here we go stops getting spicy this isn't going to be a boring story we're have some real friction here what are the religious leaders gonna do and they are to kill jesus and they have to kill these guys too it says when they saw the courage of peter and john and realized that that they were unschooled ordinary men they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with jesus but since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them there's nothing they could say so they ordered them to withdraw from the sandhedrin and then they conferred together what are we going to do with these men they asked everybody living in jereus on no they've done an outstanding miracle we can't deny it but to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus the peter and john replied judge for yourselves whether it's right in god so they were to be after further threats they the religious leaders let them go they couldn't decide how to punish them because all the people were praising god for what had happened for the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old so there you go there's our first post jesus collision between the message of the kingdom and the religious leaders which again the version of that is basically what we're still trying to sort out once we get on to glaceans well turned out this story peter and john they get released and they go back and they tell all these other people who are now followers of jesus exactly what happened and everybody's excited and they praise god and they sing together and they pray together sovereign lord you've made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them you spoke by the holy spirit through the mouth of your servant our father david quote why did the nation's rage and the people's plot in vain the kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the lord and against his anointed one and then they recall all the powerful leaders who tried to resist the jesus thing and they recall how god the father and jesus in the holy spirit overcame all of that after the celebratory prayer the holy spirit shows up and it's almost like there's an earthquake or something the tangible presence of the holy spirit is so evident in the room and in the lives of the people and so the message of the kingdom the whole jesus thing has just passed the first jesus has ascended into heaven test with flying colors says that all the believers were of one heart and mind and they were sharing everything with each other and nobody had any need and they were adding people to their number every day and there's nothing that anybody could do to stop it people are dumping their money into helping each other and so we end x chapter four kind of the same way that we started it feeling like wow what can stand in the way of this message we asked a couple of days ago why is there a christianity and it's coming into focus it's because the bible holds us out as his message being the truest realist thing and god being firmly and demonstrably behind it and there's just no resisting it so i guess it's just going to be smooth seyland from here on out right the rest of the book of acts all the way up to the Galatians should be cake well i'm peeking ahead no it's not going to be cake they're going to be more in different challenges that we didn't see coming we'll unpack a couple more chapters of all of this manana i kind of feel bad i feel like i was mean to that movie now and maybe something like the movie maybe some of you want to go see the movie i'm not trying to talk yet it's in the movie it's this is harmless it's fine maybe i missed something maybe i got i went to the bathroom and that's when the conflict happened thanks
