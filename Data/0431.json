This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and you're probably going to laugh at me, but I would like to admit right now that until very recently I did not know what the expression cut to the quick meant. I mean, I knew metaphorically that it means getting past the surfacey external stuff and getting all the way down to the heart and maybe even wounding someone because you got a little too deep into their business or into what makes them them. But I did not know that this expression is apparently drawn from trimming nails or claws on an animal. Maybe the person who told me this was lying to me because they know I have a podcast and I would run right to the microphone and tell you, I don't know. What I heard is that the part of the claw that is still living and that is still being fueled with blood and nutrients, you get down to the quick, that's actually part of the animal, whereas the rest is like a nail or hair. I guess it's attached to you, but it's not living in the same sense that something that's connected to blood vessels is living. So if you cut that claw on your pet too far down, it'll bleed and now you're not trimming external things anymore. You're getting down to the real actual self of that dog and that's mean and it hurts. So you want to be careful not to cut to the quick. Likewise, from time to time, I've got feedback in life that cuts to the quick. The remark gets past the external stuff that is connected to me, but not really me and gets all the way down to the stuff that is really me and it makes the recipient of such a remark metaphorically bleed. I think cut to the quick is an appropriate expression to describe what we've been looking at here in Matthew chapter 19 for the last couple of days. There's this rich young ruler who comes up to Jesus and he is going to take a big swing at solving this riddle of how one gets into the kingdom that other people seem to have struggled to understand. And he is a very, very special boy who's got a ton of resources and seems to be appreciated and approved of by lots of people. And he really seems like a very good candidate to walk up and solve this question, solve this riddle that has been hard for people to understand. And Jesus makes three pretty simple, artful, succinct maneuvers to get past this rich young ruler's exteriors, crutches his techniques and tricks for getting by socially. And I want to break that down a little bit further today, but I want to do so empathetically because I know what it's like to get cut to the quick and I know what it feels like to have it pointed out in front of a big group of people that I am not nailing it and I do not have it figured out. So we're in Matthew chapter 19 starting in verse 16 goes like this. Says, now a man came up to Jesus and asked, teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life? Why do you ask me about what's good? Jesus replied, there's only one who's good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments, which ones the man inquired? Jesus replied, don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't give false testimony, honor your father and mother and love your neighbor as yourself. All these I've kept, the young man said, what do I still lack? Jesus answered, if you want to be perfect, go sell your possessions and give to the poor and then you'll have treasure in heaven, then come follow me. When the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had great wealth. I'm empathetic because I'm reading between the lines of the text and I see somebody who mom and dad proved up greatly, they heaped wealth and accolades on him. And he imagines that he's going to be the one who walks up and pulls the sword out of the stone. Except he puts his feet on the stone and he grabs the hilt of the sword and he yanks frantically and it doesn't work. He runs into a buzz saw here in Jesus. This kid is effectively taking the biggest, most flawless swing with world kingdom values that you could take at solving the kingdom riddle. This is the very best face you could put on humanity youthful, probably handsome, has money, has respect, could be with any girl he wants to be with. Everyone is dazzled by him and his family name and his properties and holdings. He's probably well educated and regarded as so special and so brilliant. You just see things the rest of us don't see rich young ruler. You're the best. I do believe this conversation is going down in front of a lot of other people. And in a sense, he's acting as the champion of the people who can still only think in terms of world terms. And Jesus meekly calmly, kindly, graciously brushes it aside in just a couple of conversational strokes. Conversational stroke number one is to say good. I won't tell me more about this goodness. There's only one who's actually good, but we'll let that breathe for a second. Then Jesus goes into masterful pushback part two, which is to say, okay, well, let's run the thought exercise. And if you want to enter life, obey the commandments and the special golden boys like which ones, maybe he's thinking, I'm going to set this up really well because I've actually obeyed all of them really well. So whatever Jesus throws out, no matter how rigorous I'm going to be able to be like, yeah, done it. And so Jesus throws out as we talked about with Aaron the other day, all of the measurable parts of the 10 commandments. And sure enough, the special special boys like all of these. We've kept, what do I still lack? And then here's part three of Jesus masterful pushback. He's like, ah, I can see your game plan for entering the kingdom is perfection. Well, okay, if perfection's the game plan, you're going to have to give up that crutch. You're going to have to give up the thing that makes you you the thing that is your super secret social superpower that you use to get the things you want to get people to do the things you want that you use in your brain to separate you from the normies and to make you feel important. You're going to have to part ways with that. So just get rid of all of your stuff, strip yourself of your identity and the thing that makes you you and gives you power in your mind. And then you should be good to go and come follow me. No, it's not even first and foremost that Jesus is in Tony. You're greedy. It's that he's cutting to the quick. He's passed all of the external crutches and things that this kid relied on. And he got all the way down to the heart to the soul of who he is and to what's broken and wrong about him. And the kid feels it. And it's difficult to reconcile that and to work all of that through in the moment. So he walks away and aside from some playful rhetorical ribbing, I really don't think we should pile on this kid too hard. He's in good company. Other good people have failed this test. I think of Matthew chapter eight when Jesus comes down from the sermon on the mount. People are all like, wow, you teach with authority. This makes more sense. I want to be a part of the kingdom. And people are flirting with what it looks like to sign up. And remember the one person comes and is like, Hey, I will follow you wherever you go. Is Matthew eight 19 20? And then Jesus replies, F oxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the son of man has no place to lay his head. And we get the impression from the silence in the text that that guy wasn't down with homelessness and so we bailed. And then another person comes up verse 21 that text actually describes him as already a follower of Jesus, a disciple. He's getting ready to go to the next level. And he says, Lord, first let me go and bury my father. Jesus said, follow me and let the dead bury their own dead. I think all three of these characters were very impressed by Jesus. And there's no indication that the three of these people didn't listen to what Jesus said and then like five minutes later be like, all right, I get it. And maybe the rich young ruler after Jesus died and was raised and vindicated. Maybe a couple of years after this, the rich young rulers are like, yeah, my stuff doesn't matter. I'm cashing it all out. Maybe the rich young ruler is even a name we would know from another part of the Bible. And Matthew just wrote Matthew early enough that that little detail didn't get connected for us here. Who knows how the story turned out in that moment, though, all three of these people still had a mingling of kingdom values for how to achieve kingdom stuff and world values for how to achieve kingdom stuff and world values just don't get it done. That world value stuff, apparently, as I'm reading the text, just doesn't have any currency. It doesn't have any purchasing power in the kingdom. It's kingdom values that have purchasing power in the kingdom and understandably it's going to be really hard for somebody, especially without the benefit of the whole New Testament in 2000 years of church history and philosophy like we have. It's going to be hard for somebody to figure that out on their first swing, even if it is a very impressive first swing, a very impressive resume that they bring to the table. The reality is that we got 19 chapters of Matthew that you and I have looked at so far, my friends, that are drilling into our heads again and again that the things that make you think you are important and valuable might be great in the world currency and in the systems we run in here. But in the kingdom, it is the merit and value and grace of the king and what he is up to and what he's into. And that's it. I don't bring anything to the table that he does not have in unlimited abundance already according to the text. There's nothing that I have to offer that he could not call out of non-existence with a thought that I can bring to the table. I think it's very important and very intentional on the part of Matthew and Jesus that this thing keeps coming up because you're not going to get it on the first pass. Therefore, hey, empathy to this kid who took a good swing, but like all of us didn't get it on the first pass. Last thought and there is pretty much always a last thought. I wanted to say thanks for everybody who's gone over to check out the new podcast Iron Wood Rhino. The second episode of that is now up. It's a conversation I had with Tina. My friend who helps me with a whole bunch of different internet stuff. She did a great job. She tells the story of a dream that she had that corresponds to a thing that actually happened in real life. And I come at it skeptically and poke at it and we have a really fun, enjoyable conversation and I think you'll love it. I would be honored if you would go and check out that Ironwood Rhino podcast whenever you have the opportunity. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
