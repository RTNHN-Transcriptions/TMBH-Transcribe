This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and today is a very, very special day because my friend Aaron, you text joins us. Aaron, hello. Good to be here, man. Now, it's a very professional greeting pack. You did a nice job. You're well suited for this. Aaron is good at being a friend and he's good at fishing and fixing things and he's also good at Bible. So I thought it'd be fun to have him jump in with us and think about some of the stuff that we're going to be getting to in just a minute here in Matthew 19. But first, it's time for a charming childhood anecdote that somehow connects to what we're going to talk about in the Bible. When I was little, mom would make food for us that I didn't like, that she learned to make from my grandpa who made food that I didn't like. He made a lot of things that had horrible sounding names. He made goulash for us a lot and then he had a thing called Mulligan Gut Stew that he made. I think the name was just meant to torture us. I don't remember at all what was in the Mulligan Gut Stew, but it was not my favorite as a young person. Mom would make tuna casserole and some of those other things that were popular back in the day, but then I think deep down, no one actually liked, but as a kid, you don't have the filter for that. So if you don't like it, you're just like, I don't know. It's not really my thing. I don't think it was rude to my parents. It just didn't eat some of the food they put in front of me. And over time, we developed this negotiating thing that would happen every time we'd eat. We'd sit down and if it was food, I wasn't sure about that mom would be like, there's a food and she put it on my plate and I would like poke at it a little bit. I don't think I want to eat that. And then I would say, all right, well, how many bites of this do I have to eat before I can get down and get down and be like, not dance, but like get out of the chair and leave and be done with food. And mom would always throw out a number of five, three, something like that. And then I would take the smallest bites possible to make it look like I'd satisfied the requirement, but then she'd look at the plate and she'd be like, you just move things around. You just move the tuna casserole around. And I can tell you took like two tiny baby bites that doesn't count. You have to eat all of the bites. It's not how my mom sounded at all. It's a terrible impersonation. We would negotiate further and eventually I would get to the minimum number of bites required to achieve my goal, which was get down from the table and go back to doing whatever thing I was doing, playing and reading books or whatever. In Matthew chapter 19, we get the equivalent of this in a grown up form and a conversation between a rich guy and Jesus. He comes up to Jesus and he's like, Hey, how many bites of good behavior do I have to take before I can get into heaven, please? And right off the bat, you can tell that the issue is if somebody asks that they don't really get the equation, just like you can tell right off the bat. If you put food that you made, slaving over a hot stove because you love your kid and you're a great mom, you put that food on his plate. And his first question is how many bites of this do I have to eat before I can stop eating it? It means that the kid just doesn't get it. And so in this situation, we're going to see how Jesus navigates it. Is he going to go through the front door and blow the kid up or is he going to do his rabbinical teaching thing that he does so often? He's spoiler alert. It's the latter one. So it goes like this. Matthew chapter 19 verse 16. Now man came up to Jesus and asked teacher what good thing must I do to get eternal life? And then Jesus asks him back, why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus replied, there's only one who's good. If you want to enter life obey the commandments, which once the man inquired, Jesus replied, don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't give false testimony. Honor your father and mother and love your neighbors yourself. All these I've kept. The young man said, what do I still lack? Jesus answered, if you want to be perfect, go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you'll have treasure in heaven. Then come follow me. When the young man heard this, he went away sad because he had great wealth. And Jesus said to his disciples some stuff that we're going to look at later on in a future episode. So Aaron, is there anything right about the question that this young man is leading with? Is he still on solid footing here in this first interaction with Jesus or does he already not get it right out of the gate? Probably a combination of those two things. Tell me about the combination. Well, the combination is he sees Jesus as some kind of authority and he wants the real answer, but there's always a mixed motive and there's this kind of a underneath here. Just sort of a self justifying motivation, I think, to what he's thinking. Maybe he's not even aware of. So in the same way that I'm asking my mom what the absolute minimum I can do to get the thing I want is instead of appreciating the exercise, you're reading between the lines and sensing that he's looking for the absolute minimum. He's not understanding the exercise. Yeah, probably. What is the exercise? The exercise is, so Jesus points him to the commandments. Well, what do I need to do? And I think right there, there's a paradigm shift because I think what Jesus has introduced throughout the gospel of Matthew and picked up on and the rest of the New Testament is the whole kingdom of heaven thing really isn't defined by what you do. And so he's framed it up this way and Jesus is going to kind of turn that on its head. He says, well, keep the commandments. Okay. I feel pretty good about that. I've done that, which one specifically? Jesus lists him, do not murder, do not commit adultery, don't steal false witness. Honor your father and mother and love your neighbor as yourself. Those are the commandments that are human oriented. The first chunk of commandments are God oriented. And so Jesus lays this out and he says, well, when I compare people horizontally, when I look at myself compared to others, I've done really well. And Jesus says, well, you mean the rich young rulers. Yeah. Yeah. And so Jesus throws this kind of back at him, well, I've done all this. What do I lack? Jesus says, well, should you get rid of your stuff then and come follow me. And that throws him for a loop because he had lots of stuff. And it demonstrates that he really wasn't following the commands because the first command is no idolatry, nor are gods before me. And so Jesus without really calling him on the carpet points out to him, you really haven't followed the commandments as thoroughly as you think you have because these things are idols between you and God. Well, all those commandments that Jesus listed here are all the externally measurable ones. These are all the ones that you could do before men, harkening back to the Sermon on the Mount. And how important it is to be careful not to do your acts of righteousness, quote unquote, before men. Because if your goal is to be seen by men and celebrated because people look at you and they're like, hey, look at how well behaved you are, I tell you, you will receive your reward and full. If you want to impress people with religious things is Jesus teachings and the Sermon on the Mount says, you're going to get what you want. But the harder thing is the kind of righteousness that comes from the level of the heart. So I feel like all of this is a hardcore throwback to the Sermon on the Mount because of the beginning of chapter five, Jesus unpacks the values of the kingdom, the beatitudes, then he says I didn't come to do away with the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them. And then he goes on to say, but you know, access to this kingdom with these beautiful values I'm describing, your righteousness would have to surpass even that of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And then people are like, well, how would that be? And then he goes into all of the you've heard it said, but I tell you that statements that run on through the rest of the chapter and into the next one there. And in doing so, he's pointing out that there's something beyond measurable external obedience that impresses people that counts that matters. Your motivation, who you are, what's going on that matters. And so by not listing all of the unmeasurable, indeterminable, outwardly, uncelebratable by men, commandments, it seems like Jesus is playing the guy. He's bringing him along a little bit. If the question from the start is how many bites of this do I have to eat before I can be done eating this food you provided for me? My mom might have been mistaken by going into a negotiation with me. She probably should have gone philosophy mode like this to get me to rethink food and how lucky I am to be provided for. And I think Jesus is going into philosophy mode here, like you're saying, to demonstrate the missingness of the point. Well, it's kind of how obviously I'm not an expert in any of this, but what you hear people say and you read in books is that it's a little bit how the rabbis would teach with this questioning kind of going back and forth the dialogue method rather than just straightforward didactic. So Jesus kind of pulls him into this debate or into this conversation rather. And in that he doesn't confront the guy right away. He draws him in to this dialogue and then the guy realizes, oh yeah, I haven't kept him as well as I thought. And so it's a way of disarming him so that he is able to hear the message. And I think that's one of the beauties of that kind of teaching style. So I really like how Jesus disarmed him and draws him in. And it sort of softens him to hear what he maybe didn't want to hear by nature, but was now enabled to hear. And by the guy coming forward to Jesus, this isn't probably a private conversation. Now he's sort of stuck. Like, okay, you just pinpricked my balloon in front of everyone. And now I'm kind of on the hook. I have to either disqualify you as a teacher or accept what you say and go do something about it. Here's what I'm thinking, buddy. We've got a long ways to go in terms of processing this through together. And I have some places that I'm hoping the conversation goes as well. So what do we do this? This is a Friday episode. What if we just keep talking as long as we want to and we'll take the balance of this conversation and make it a bonus episode for tomorrow? Do you have time to sit in and keep running for a while? Absolutely. Okay, we'll just do it that way. So with that, everybody, more of this tomorrow as a special bonus Saturday episode and then we'll get back to normal on Monday. I'm Matt.
