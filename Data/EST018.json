Astaiages is kind of a kooky old man, he was paranoid, like a lot of kings are. He's like, we gotta get rid of my grandson. He's a threat. I don't want to kill him, I don't feel good about it, but you, Mr. General guy, you do it for me. And Harpagus was like, I don't want to kill a baby, I don't think I'm probably going to do that at all. So he just gave the kid some shepherds to be raised. But remember, Cyrus, according to the mythic storytelling of the Greek historian Herodotus, was just too awesome. Then he couldn't keep his awesome, kingly blood under control. And eventually people were like, wait a day, you're too good at children's games. You're a king, aren't you? I guess. I guess you got me. And then Astaiages, of course, Cyrus is grandpa. He was real mad because he thought that kid was dead, but he played it cool with Harpagus, his right hand man. I was like, oh, no, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. He ignored my orders. It's cool. It's probably going to work out great. And he threw a big banquet. Remember the banquet? And then at that banquet, he did something real horrible. He murdered Harpagus's kid and then delivered that news to Harpagus in a very memorable way. You remember all of that, right? And I can't remember if I told you how that wrapped up or not. So if this is repeat, fun, if it's not, here's how that wrapped up. Well, a little bit later on, there's that fight that was going on between Astaiages and Cyrus. Finally, that grew into a hot war between Astaiages of the Medes and Cyrus of the Persians. And for whatever reason, Astaiages, who I guess must have been somewhat of an idiot, didn't remember the things that he did to his right-hand man Harpagus. And when the battle was at its hottest point, Harpagus just took all of his part of the army of the Medes and went over to Cyrus's side. I was like, that's what you get for feeding my kid to me. And as you're reading along through the narrative in Herodotus, you're like, well, I kind of saw that one coming because I don't think a dad's going to forget that anytime soon. Because some of these things, there are certain offenses. They just really, really linger. And either somebody just reading the story from a distance or as someone who's maybe been deeply wronged yourself, you want to see that ironed out. You want to see symmetry there. You want to see that get fixed, that deep wrong get righted. Well, when we get to the book of Ezra and we are reading about the writing of some deep wrongs that have been done to the Jewish people, I mean, did they have it coming? Was God punishing them? Yes, sure. But also the Babylonians were also jerks more on that in a minute and they mocked God and they looted the temple and they did awful things. And that is illustrated over in the book of Daniel. Now I have to note this one more time. I'm sorry. Just trying to make this all make sense. The Old Testament, almost all of the history stuff is in the first third of the Old Testament. It's all stacked up right together. And we're right toward the end of the history section when we're looking at second chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and then Esther. After Esther, we get into more poetry and wisdom literature stuff. And then toward the end in the last third of the Old Testament, we get the prophets and the prophets are from all different eras. And some of them are from this era that we're talking about with Babylon and Persia and this really volatile moment in history that we've been spending time learning about together. And so you got to turn like, listen how many pages this is. You got to turn that far from Ezra over to Daniel in order to get this other part of the story, but it all fits together. And in Daniel chapter five, we encounter the last day of the Babylonian empire and it all happens around a feast. And this feast is decadent and sloppy and the king looks stupid and he's mocking God. And we see this motif of the decadent banquet of the king who does great evil throughout the whole Bible. And in the New Testament, you get this with the feast of Herod, the one that ultimately culminates in John the Baptist's head being on a platter. We're going to see this in Esther, really more than one banquet in Esther. And we see it here in Daniel five with the regent king of Babylon, this guy, Bell Shazar. And here's the way the feast is described in Daniel chapter five, King Bell Shazar gave a great banquet for thousands of his nobles and he drank wine with them. Okay, that's all fine. That's what you do at Benk was as cool. But then while Bell Shazar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar, his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem so that the king and his nobles and his wives and his concubines might drink from them. So he gets licked up. He wants to impress people. Let's show everybody some booty pun not intended, but it works really well when you consider what the decadence of the king, how that manifests itself at the beginning of the book of Esther. So I'm just going to, I'm just going to keep that. I'm not going to run it again. We're going to show everybody some sweet, sweet booty. Bring out the stuff that we stole from the temple. Bring it out here right now. Everybody just drink from it. And let's do that. Well, we celebrate gods of gold and silver and bronze and iron and wood and stone. And so there's this mockery that sticks in the crawl of the reader that just sits there like, whoa, another violation of decency and dignity is happening at another one of these grisly ancient world banquets. And that ought to be righted at some point. Well, the beginning of the writing, another great pun there that is writing R.I.G. H.T. I.N.G. and writing W.R.I.T. I.N.G. That was lucky. I'm going to keep that too. That happens in the very next verse. Here's what happens is this banquets getting really sloppy and drunk. Suddenly, the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote of the plaster of the wall near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote his face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way. And the king is like, you got to get somebody in here to tell me what this writing means. And nobody really do that. They're all like, yeah, Daniel. Remember that guy, Jewish guy, he seems to know things like this. Let's have Daniel come in and Daniel's like, all right, I'm going to tell you, you're not going to like it. And he goes on to say the inscription means this. God has numbered the days of your reign, King of Babylon and brought it to an end. You've been weighed on the scales and found wanting your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and the Persians. And this is how the chapter, this is how the banquet wraps up that very night. Bell Shaser, King of the Babylonians was slain and Darius, the me to took over the kingdom at the age of 62. I've done videos and stuff about Darius, the mead. So I'm not going to talk about him a whole bunch, but it seems pretty obvious to me that Darius was a very important general under Cyrus, whose job in this multifaceted offensive against the Babylonians was to be the point of the spear, the vanguard that would enter Babylon itself and have the honor of capturing the city. And we know from history that Cyrus, the great showed up in Babylon a few weeks later in that same fall of 539 BC. But back to the point in the same way that hard Vegas had something that was sticking in his craw because of what happened to that banquet. So the attentive reader, the person who is sympathetic to the Jewish exiles here is going to have something sticking in their craw about this mockery that happened at the feast of Bell Shaser. All that stuff that was consecrated to God that got stolen from the temple is now being used in a mocking ridiculous fashion. That might not seem like that big a deal to you or to me, but to the original audience. They would have wanted to have seen that righted back to the book of. Ezra, where we get this pronouncement from Cyrus, the great, this grand reversal Babylon is gone. The Persians are now here and right off the bat, one of the first things we're going to do is we're going to let anybody who wants to, who's Jewish go back and rebuild this thing. Further, we're going to give you the resources to pull it off. And then we proceed into the book of Ezra and we learn even more says, then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and Levites, everyone whose heart got it moved, prepared to go up and build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem. All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold. So again, it's kind of like the plundering of the Egyptians during the Exodus Persia is being plundered here as well. Or maybe a better way to look at it would be what's left of Babylon is being plundered here. So I get him silver and gold goods and livestock with valuable gifts in addition to all the free will offerings. And here we go. Here's the payoff for this old wrong that needs to be righted that is still lingering out there. Here's where one more over King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his God, lowercase G. Cyrus, King of Persia had them brought by the third of that man. That is a tricky name. Mithridath, the treasure who counted them out to Shesh Bazar, the Prince of Judah. This was the inventory. Gold dishes, 30 silver dishes, 1000 silver pans, 29 gold bowls, 30 matching silver bowls, 410 other articles, 1000 in all. There were 5,400 articles of gold and silver. Shesh Bazar brought all these along when the exiles came up from Babylon to Jerusalem. Now, this is one of those parts of the Old Testament that you can get to be boring to some other dumb list of things. But if we're really paying attention to this, this is a huge deal. It's a payoff and it helps us get inside the mind of the original audience and the person who wrote this because this is indicative of a writing of something that had gone wrong. It's indicative of God's promise to still have plans to prosper these people and not to harm them to resolve what judgment was coming through his chosen instrument of judgment, the Babylonians. Remember a while back when we were talking about Habakkuk? This is the prophet who about 70 years before all of these events are going down. He realizes what God is going to do. He's going to raise up the Babylonians to punish the Jewish people and Habakkuk doesn't like it. And he goes to God and he says, what the heck? If you thought we were doing so badly that you were going to punish us like this, why didn't you stop us from behaving so poorly before it got to this level? And further, how can you use Babylon to punish us? They're even worse than us. I mean, come on, not Babylon. God's like, well, yeah, I'm going to use them to punish you. And you do have it coming. And this is all for my purposes. And also they're going to get theirs later on too. I won't forget the stuff that they got wrong. And Habakkuk is like, okay, no key. Great. All right. I'm good with that. And that's kind of the end of the book, but it's a prophecy that's hanging out there in the background. Ezra is giving us the payoff to that prophecy right there. Babylon is defeated, gone in one night at the hands of Darius the Mede, his overlord Cyrus and the Persians. And further, these articles that were looted from the temple that might give the impression that the lowercase G gods of Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians were greater than the upper case G real God of Abraham and his descendants. Any notion that that's the case now in ancient world parlance, this is a way of spiking that football and being like, nope, God was still paying attention. The one true God still saw it through. And this has been completely righted all the way down to the end detail. And I for one relish, I savor so greatly enjoy those kind of little wrinkles and details that help us get into the world of the Bible and the stuff that we're reading about from so, so, so long ago. Again, the Bible holds out what Cyrus is doing here as being directly under the influence of God as being a thorough reversal, a thorough follow through on the promises that God made to move things forward and sustain the redemptive plan and even punish those wrongdoers who God chose to use as instruments of his own judgment and correction against his own people. There's so many payoffs in Cyrus's proclamation here in 538 BC and so many payoffs in the way Ezra describes it here in the first chapter of the book of Ezra that we've been looking at. We still got to talk more about what exactly Cyrus was thinking politically and how this all works, but in the same way that there was a grievous offense against harpagus that was a mockery of him and everything he believed in that needed to be set right that eventually harpagus paid off by citing against astieties of the Medes and with Cyrus the great. So there was a grievous offense that occurred at a banquet that needed to be set right. It was a mockery and God did not forget and he paid that off and he set it straight just a couple of years later with this action that he prompted Cyrus the great to take and I will say for the second or third time in this conversation that Isis think that's really nifty. Okie dokie more on this next time around a Matt is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
