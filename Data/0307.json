And that is all very bibily. But when we look at the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, what we see is that Jesus' invitation as he himself framed it is a little bit different than that. It's not competing with that thing I just described. Rather his invitation comes in the form of an invitation to follow him as king and to become a citizen of his kingdom. This is in contrast to the default setting of humanity, which is to follow ourselves as kings of our own lives and to be a part of the world system and its values, which is all predicated on the assumption of naturalism. You're born, you're meat sack and you live and there's meaning that you find and you come up with and you make up at what you can and you enjoy it as best as you can and then you're dead and when the last person remembers your name or says your name, you're just gone and it's over and your matter returned to another form of matter. Those are the world system assumptions upon which the world system values are predicated and Jesus, once again by contrast, is articulating a completely different set of foundational assumptions that there is a God that people are made in the image of God, that people are caught up in and participants in this great struggle and that this great struggle is one where evil and the opposite of the things of God is played out through sinfulness and fallenness and it affects people and destroys people but life is more than just the body. It's more than just what goes on here, it's more than just ashes to ashes, dust to dust. There's an eternal component and a significance to people who again are made in the image of God and Jesus comes along and is pointing out that in light of this and in light of the character and nature and values of God, there is this other kingdom that has values that are in keeping with those assumptions and it looks very different than the world kingdom. So when Jesus talks about the front end of Christianity, when he invites people to follow him in the gospels, it doesn't have that same systematic theological 20th century argumentational transactional tone that the first thing I describe does, it has more of an invitational tone. There is a better thing, there is a more real thing, there is a truer thing. I am the truest king. Follow me is the invitation and the math equation Jesus is doing in terms of the value of the world system versus the value of the kingdom system, it's not even a math equation. One has no lasting eternal value and the other one is everything. And so then if you and I, whether coming from a perspective of faith or not faith, want to process through the book of Matthew and really understand what the Jesus character is saying and what the narrator, the author Matthew is saying, we have to fixate on that kingdom thing the same way Jesus is fixating on that kingdom thing. That is at the heart of the message for outsiders who are looking in and thinking about being a part of it. It's an invitation to another kingdom, another system, something that is truer and realer and better and transcendent. So when Jesus talks about the kingdom every time that comes up and I think it is mentioned in literally every chapter of the gospel of Matthew, we got to be attentive to that and latch on to every little morsel of detail we can get in terms of learning more about what the kingdom is because the kingdom is the invitation. This is the thing that you're being told is really worth it and really great and it's understandable that you would have questions about something that is purportedly so great. And so we get these little morsels that are unfolding along the way. So now we're here in Matthew chapter 13 and we get all of these parables, these stories about the kingdom and all of them come with little nuggets, little morsels that are very important. And these nuggets of information are designed to help us size up what we're maybe signing up for. They're designed to help us size up the credibility of the claim. And particularly in Matthew 13, what we're learning about is how is this thing going to work out? I mean, it's so true and it's so real is everybody just going to immediately sign up? Is there going to be a process here? Are people still going to be mad about things? Are you going to show up with a God sword and just make everybody do everything? And further, what are those of us who do decide to sign up supposed to do about the people who don't? And that is at the heart of the question in my favorite parable in Matthew 13 that we have been working on together. This is the parable of the wheat and the weeds. This is the one that starts with a good and noble master sewing good seed out in his field and then some enemy sneaks in there at night and so is bad seed right along with it. It is indecipherable in the early stages of growth from the good seed. The servants come along and they're like, whoa, what is going on here? Something's messed up. They look really close. You can see that we got a problem. And they go to the master and they're like, hey, didn't you sow good seed in the master? It's like, I sure did. An enemy did this and the servants, they are ready to go to war. They're like, let's just go tear it up. Do you want us to go rip everything up right now? And the master says, no, because then ripping up the bad stuff, you're going to rip up the good stuff as well. In other words, what he's saying is you don't have the touch for that. You don't have the discernment to get that right. You're going to wreck beautiful things as you try to do away with the bad things. You're just not nuanced enough. You are too blunt an instrument. No, instead we're going to let these things grow up together and it will become much more evident down the road, which one is which. And then we'll have the harvesters go through there and separate that out. We will burn the dangerous rival crop that actually literally hurts people and then we will hang on to the good awesome crop that was still there all along growing up alongside the yuck. And then a little bit later on in private, Jesus explains to his disciples that the son of man, him, is the master, the enemy is the evil one. Presumably that just means the devil. The seed are the sons and daughters of the kingdom representing the values of the kingdom and the field is the world. He also goes on to explain that the harvesters at the end are the angels who I guess are somehow helping out with the judgment and sorting process and that the terrors are evil and the people who perpetrate that evil with great intentionality and that the wheat are the righteous who've inherited the righteousness and the values of the kingdom from Jesus himself. And why am I taking all this time to review stuff that we've hit pretty hard the last few days? And the simple answer is it's about what we were talking about at the beginning of this conversation. Remember, the kingdom is not just some description of a future thing and how some notion of the end times works out. The kingdom is the invitation. The kingdom is the thing that we are being invited to and it's governed, it's ruled by the king to whom those who respond positively to this invitation are going to submit. But we have to think about this not just as some far out distant thing that happens in the future, but this parable of the wheat and the weeds is characterizing the whole transaction. It's characterizing the whole deal and therefore it's characterizing what you are going to do. Should you sign up to be a part of the kingdom? Should you become a son, a daughter, a child, an heir, an agent, a representative of the kingdom? So here's some things in light of that that I don't think this parable can possibly mean. I think it can mean that things are going to get rough in church sometimes, both because Jesus specifically says the field isn't the church, it's the world, and three chapters from now he's going to give us a very detailed breakdown of what to do when things do get weird in church. I don't think this passage can mean that nobody should ever discriminate between ideas because you can't really tell the difference between wheat and tears and you would probably get it wrong. Because everything is true and everything is equally likely and we just sit around in a state of wonderment forever and someday God will sort all of that stuff out. That's not at all what Jesus is modeling or teaching anywhere else. No, it's all over the New Testament that you're supposed to be able to tell the difference between things that are true and that are not true. So it can't mean don't think and don't differentiate between ideas. Whereas an attempt at some misguided notion of holiness, we engage in ultimate nihilistic skepticism about any truth claim whatsoever. No, things can be known. Jesus makes that clear. What I do think this parable means for the aspiring kingdom citizen or the already in kingdom citizen is way better than any of those rejected applications or interpretations. But I think it means is something that takes a ton of pressure off of us to play the role of the all knowing God and operate like the all knowing God or the master. Because I think it gives us a template and a reminder of what the kingdom citizens role is in the whole unfolding of everything. And what God's role or the master's role is in the whole unfolding of everything. And the other thing I think we get here is something that we are so sorely lacking in right now in terms of Christianity and theology and that is a quality thoughtful driven by the character and work of God theology of what to do with people who don't think the same things we do. A theology of how to interact with the world kingdom from the footing of the kingdom kingdom. And that needs a whole day's worth of conversation. So that is what we're going to break down tomorrow. This is a parable that gets into the here and now provides an ethic of how to interact with the larger world reorients the kingdom citizen to the relative modesty of their role and task list and to the not modesty and gigantorness of God's role and his task list in terms of how the whole kingdom plays out. And we will break that down more tomorrow. Thank you a ton to everybody who jumped in at patreon.com slash the Tmbh podcast. For just a couple of days out from finalizing our order on all of the cool little field notebooks that we're going to send out and I'll go ahead and make sure to over order that so that even if you come on a little bit after we place the order, I'll still have extras so I can send one of those to literally everybody who is a patron of the program at literally any level of support once we have all of those in hand. Thank you again. I can't wait for tomorrow's conversation. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
