the thing from your civics class well if you're american at least that talked about the this provision in the supreme law of our land about no x post facto laws remember that one i think it's one of those discuss a nice rhythm to it and is latin sticks in your brain maybe forget a lot of the other things but expo spato you sound real smart and it's like i remember that one if you remember it you know that the deal with the constitution prohibiting expo spato laws the deal there is that you can't go and write a law after the fact and now somebody's guilty of that law that you just wrote so let's say that i don't like pickleball and i become the president of everything and i get a congress and a senate is willing to play ball with me and i'm like we're gonna retroactively make pickle ball illegal forever because i hate that noise also you taking up all of my tennis courts so past the law got a whole bunch of sad tennis players gathered around me in the oval office who are disappointed by the effect that pickleball is had on their lives and they're all clapping together in their wearing their headbands and their wristbands and their real short shorts and everything they are weird bulges in their pockets where their tennis balls are but they're all really excited because i signed the law that makes pickleball illegal effective forever ago we can't do that our constitution makes it so you can't do that you can't make people guilty of a law that hasn't happened yet likewise we are in the middle of a little aside in Galatians chapter three where paul is using an example from everyday life the example of a contract a deal that is binding to find a touchpoint common point for his audience to be like hey we all understand how this works we're talking ultimately hearing Galatians about what the deal is between god and man and there's a couple of really big deals that are in view anytime we have that discussion it's the covenant that god made with Abraham and then four hundred-ish years after the fact it's the covenant that god made with moses so and so paul's getting relatively esoteric hearing Galatians three fifteen yesterday we imagine that he's flipping his hat around backwards and his chair and he's sitting there like the cool youth pastor the cool teacher who just wants to keep it real for a minute and he's going to this very real life example to say let's use some common sense about how deals work about how contracts work and he's assuming that everybody understands that even if your constitution doesn't expressly forbid it it makes no sense you can't have a society if you're allowed to write laws that retroactively make people guilty if you did something and it wasn't illegal at the time that you did it a law written later doesn't suddenly make you guilty of violating law it wasn't illegal when you did it this is just common sense and paul specifically is looking at more of the civil law aspect of this if you make a deal a covenant a contract well it applies to the time span and the participants the parties specified in the contract so let's track with paul's argument here and let's take it forward to the end of it today he says in Galatians three fifteen chair flips around hat flips around brothers let me take an example from everyday life just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established so it is in this case and everybody's like okay yeah right on i mean those are the rules that make sense no exposed facto laws the promises were spoken to abraham and to his seed the scripture doesn't say and to seeds meaning many people but and to your seed meaning one person who is christ what i mean is this the law introduced 430 years later does not set aside the covenant previously established by god and thus do away with the promise okay simple logic here remember yesterday i was telling you about my all-tell contract that i got in the early days of cell phones and all the people at all the Verizon stores whenever they'd pull up my account would be like oh you were on that sacred precious unbreakable enviable all-tell contract never let that go man two hands on my shoulders deep penetrating eye contact never let that go i had that sweet contract well it was with all-tell i didn't even know what Verizon was and some other company called Verizon comes along they're like we owe you now we bought your thing now you work with us like okay well that's cool but both parties agreed like just because you did some paperwork or an acquisition or just because you guys did a business deal or whatever that doesn't negate a contract that i still have your thing came later and does not negate or bridge or change the deal that i have in writing and that i'm locked into with the sacred precious unbreakable all-tell contract common sense to you and me and common sense to Paul's original audience here in Galatia let's pick up his reasoning again what i mean is this Paul's saying the law introduced 430 years later doesn't set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise okay God made a deal with Abraham that was a real long time ago 400 plus years before God made a deal with Moses and introduced the law that we keep talking about well how was Abraham made right with God under the terms of the deal that God made with him that was going to go forward into forever Z's faith believe God it'll be credited to you his righteousness okay well that was for Abraham but what about like you know his kids and stuff who lived before the time of Moses yeah the same deal Isaac same deal believe God it'll be credited to you his righteousness those are the terms this is generationally transferable and that's how it's laid out yeah but what about like Joseph and Benjamin Judah and all of that crowd yeah if any of them we're gonna have right standing with God damn ground rules faith believe God God does the heavy lift here it's always been about God's power his forgiveness his thing same deal well then 430 years later new terms are introduced not terms that replace the old terms nobody in this audience none of Paul's Jewish buddies trained under the law would be like yeah the Mosaic law was God taking the promises you made to Abraham and wadding him up and chucking him over his shoulder because he just didn't like how that went and now he wanted to try again it was like a fresh deal but maybe he'll work out better this time no no no no no you and I went through it we looked at it with our own eyes we listened to it with our own ears remember the plan the promise is still in place all the way through the Old Testament all the way through the New Testament nothing has changed about the unbreakable deal even though the world has changed a whole bunch now there's one covenant Paul is saying that set up the basic terms of relationship between God and man that's the deal with Abraham and then there's another covenant later that is specific to a group of people who God is going to demonstrate his character in front of the whole world through his relationship with them and the law isn't just for that the law reveals the character of God the law is good it does a way to live in the Bronze Age and the Iron Age for sure I mean it's great things about the law in terms of just practically speaking today you do better with that than you would with a lot of other approaches to things also the law had that whole set of ideas about clean and unclean all of that is meant to highlight the holiness of God and an imperfection that humanity suffers from that is bigger than volitional it's not just about naughty and nice good decisions and bad decisions the fallen nature of humanity the fall of creation touches us all in ways that we choose in ways where we tried to get it right but we got it wrong in ways where we're victims and other people do bad things to us in ways where nobody's fault just happens this world is broken the whole clean and unclean aspect of the mosaic law highlights the holiness of God highlights the imperfection of people and shines a bright spotlight on the gap between those two parties here's the problem this is the issue right here this needs addressing now ultimately the whole thing just puts the Jesus deal right up on a tee it was like that's clearly going to be the solution Jesus ticks all the boxes we need someone like that to truly fix what's wrong to truly fulfill to truly complete the law what Paul's doing here really is working for me i'm grateful for this brothers let me take an example from everyday life tone that he's striking here i think i'm getting it honestly i think this passage is coming more into focus and it maybe ever has been for me of all the times i've read Galatians ever but i don't want to rush through to the finish line so we're going to suspended animation here for one more episode on this little passage that is Galatians 3 15 through 18 and we'll land the plane on this next time around and then we're just gonna push forward like we're really taking ground here this is crazy i don't know what to do with this pace okay so we're hitting pause there thank you so much for being a part of this thing i gotta think a new ways to say it i gotta think a new ways to express to you how much i appreciate you because golly i appreciate you this is so meaningful for me it's so fun to know there are other people who care about this and want to try to understand this thing so meaningful to know there are other people who think these are the words of life and there's truth in it and even the hard things like little tiny details about whether it says seed or seeds in the old testament that stuff matters and it just takes a minute to think about it and the text expects that will take a minute to think about it and i feel like with you i found my tribe and other people who see the stakes here and care about it as well and also are willing to have a laugh about stuff and not take themselves too seriously and make some fun of themselves a little bit maybe the occasional fart joke okay that is plenty i'm gushing i really do appreciate you i'm matt this is the tenet of bible hour podcast let's do this again you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": " the", "tokens": [50363, 262,
