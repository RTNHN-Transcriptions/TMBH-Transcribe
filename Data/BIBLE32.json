Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Jonah. When I picture Jonah in my head as a book of the Bible, it's a story, I picture something really family friendly and fun and very paintable. In fact, all of the family friendly stories that I picture seem like they would work really well for decorating a kid's nursery or something. And they all have animals in them, you know, the Garden of Eden as animals, Noah's Ark, is giraffe sticking out of there. They all look friendly, they got smiles on them and stuff. Daniel and the lions, then the lions all look friendly. They're not eating anybody. Jonah and the whale, you get the big fish. Of course, when you do art for kids that depict these stories, though, you just carefully crop the image so you don't see the bloated rotting bodies banging up against the whole of the ark and you don't see the decomposing remains of the previous victims of the lions den. And the same is true of Jonah. There's a whole bunch of stuff in here that is very gritty and that prompts very adult introspection as you carefully read through this book. We don't know who wrote the book of Jonah. It seems unlikely that it was written by the title character, especially because of how bad he comes off in this story. It looks like Jonah was prophesying during the reign of Jeroboam II of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. So that would place Jonah somewhere in the middle ish of the 700s BC. It looks like Jonah is being written during this period of Northern Israel's strength and a serious relative weakness. This period of Assyrian weakness is what God is seizing upon as he sends the prophet Jonah knowing that the hearts of the Assyrians, the people of Nineveh, a great Assyrian city in this case, might be more receptive to hearing truth that they might not otherwise listen to during easier times. And so he decides to send his prophet Jonah and the message that God gives Jonah is not really spelled out. It's just go preach against Nineveh because its wickedness has come up before me. All the other prophets we've seen so far are good. God tells them to say stuff and they might be like, I really, I would rather not or this is going to be really hard for me. Maybe they negotiate with God a little bit, but they always do it. Jonah is like, nope, I'm out of here. Jonah gets on a boat to go to the far ends of the world. Some people think Tarsus where he tries to flee to is clear out by like the straits of Gibraltar all the way on the other end of the Mediterranean Sea. The end of the earth as people would have thought of it back then, there be dragons here kind of territory, but the sea turns all choppy. Jonah's down below deck in chapter one and everybody's like, how can you sleep through this? And these pagan sailors, we don't know anything about God. They don't care about any of these things. They're like, yeah, do something. Some in your God. Wow. Well, the prophet is being faithless, but these outsiders are the ones who turn to God. Oh, Jonah's like, okay, well, you know, yeah, I'm kind of a prophet or whatever. And if you throw me over, it'll probably get better. Maybe this was noble of him. Maybe that's just how bad he didn't want to go to Nineveh. It would be better to just be drowned and to die. And then we get a surprise in chapter two. I mean, they do throw him over and things do calm down, but then instead of drowning, Jonah gets swallowed up by this great fish. Now quick aside here. Some people get to this part and very understandably, they're like, ah, man, I'm with you through so much of the Bible, but somebody literally being swallowed by a literal fish. That's tough. You know, stomach acid and stuff in there probably. How do you get air for that long? Is it like that scene in Pinocchio? I just can't picture it. And look, it's a reasonable question. I think one response you might get from a Jewish follower of God or from a Christian would be, let's be honest, this isn't the weirdest thing we've caught God doing. There's a lot of stuff in the Bible where God is breaking the laws of time and space. This is just one more way that he's breaking it. Other Jewish followers of God or Christians might hear that question and say, well, there's something going on here is a literary example. Maybe there's a degree of literalness to it. Maybe not still other people would look at that and be like, ah, the Jesus points to this story. And he seems to treat it literally the point being we could go much further down that rabbit hole, but reasonable followers of God have looked at this text and said, yeah, there's some kind of metaphor going on here mingled with historical reality. The original audience would have been aware of this technique. Other reasonable followers of God are going to look at that and be like it looks like it reads like straight history. And if it seems weird, well, you're dealing with God and he can do weird things. Either way, the result is the same. The owner's in there and he has a spiritual awakening inside the belly of this fish and he prays to God. And it's really a pretty beautiful prayer in my distress. I called to the Lord and he answered me from the depths of the grave. I called for help. I mean, obviously if that sounds very sall me, it should. And if that language likening being in the belly of the fish to being in the belly of the earth or in the grave sounds familiar, it should as well because Jesus makes allusion to this story likening the belly of the fish to the grave he would be in a couple different times in the book of Matthew as well. Well, apparently God hears the prayer and all we find out about how God answers the prayers that he made the fish barf up Jonah on dry land. So then Jonah's like, okay. And to me at least chapter three makes it look like now that he's not in the belly of a fish. He doesn't have his head screwed on quite as straight anymore. And he is big grudgingly on his way to Nineveh. And as I'm reading through this thing in the context of all these other Old Testament prophets, I'm like, this is going to be a good oracle. There's going to be a lot here. But then you get to the thing that Jonah preaches and it's bare bones, almost like he's holding back the majority of it to just say the minimum amount of stuff he has to say, almost in a gesture of self sabotage to make sure he gets the outcome he wants. So this is his whole sermon to them as it's recorded 40 more days and Nineveh will be overturned. And it looks like he just walked around the streets of Nineveh just saying that in my opinion, clearly hoping they would not respond to it. So he would get what he wanted, which is the judgment of the Ninevites. But that begs the question, why does Jonah want Nineveh to get destroyed so bad? What's your problem with these guys, man? Well, really everybody had a problem with Nineveh for to be totally fair. Nobody liked Assyria. They were cruel. They were awful. They were ruthless. As I mentioned earlier, it looks like during this period, Syria was wobbling a little bit. And Jonah probably wanted the knock out blow and further, he was probably completely justified in that. But another reason I think Jonah is so fixated on God destroying Nineveh completely with no ambiguity or possibility to put it back together is for the sake of Jonah's own reputation as a prophet. Get this back in 2 Kings 14, we find out the Jerobo and the 2 Kings of Israel, the northern kingdom took advantage of this period of Assyrian weakness and he went and he conquered a whole bunch of territory. And the text says that this is in keeping with the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet Jonah, son of Amatai, exact same guy. So Jonah is probably feeling pretty good about that because he prophesied in favor of the military exploits of the king. But then just a few years later, Amos comes along. Remember, he's the southerner who goes up north to prophesy against Jerobo on the 2nd and God through Amos reverses that prophecy or at least augments it in Amos 6, 14. And God says that he's going to stir up a nation against you and he's going to oppress you throughout all of that freshly conquered land. So Jonah prophesies like God likes you and you're going to take it and then they do take it, but Amos then immediately prophesies and now it's going to be a nightmare. Maybe Jonah felt betrayed by this. Maybe he felt like God was flip flopping and making him look stupid, hanging him out to dry. Maybe all the more, Jonah's like, see, that's the kind of stuff you get when you prophesy in the court of Jerobo and the 2nd. God just doesn't have your back the way he should. He should be looking out for his own prophet, people who are loyal to him and not these clowns, these oppressors from some other country admittedly, I'm really putting words in his mouth. But I think it's a fair attempt at an explanation for how weird Jonah is being about this whole Nineveh thing will get this. Jonah trots out this pathetic version of a call to repentance. I mean, it's nothing compared to everything else that we see throughout the Old Testament prophets. And weirdly, the king of Nineveh, who's not the king of Assyria, it's a local king, is like, you know what, you got a point and we've done wrong. Maybe God will still relent if we repent and we turn to him. And then everybody repents. There's this giant religious revival in Nineveh. And then right at the end of chapter three, it says, when God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened. So in chapter four, Jonah is feeling burned by God again. This is why I didn't want to go. And he's complaining to God and he's set up shop on a hillside to look at the city of Nineveh, hoping for some Sodom and Gomorrah treatment. And as he's camped out there, grumpy and angry about everything, mad about God showing compassion to the wrong people, God shows compassion to him and he raises up this vine to give him shade. And Jonah's like, you know what, things have not been good lately, but I like my vine. This is great. Well, the next morning, God sends a worm to eat the vine and the vine gets eaten such that it no longer provides shade. And so now Jonah, who's gone through this tremendous personal calamity of having his pet vine destroyed and not getting to see an entire city of people wiped out before his eyes goes all Job's wife because of that tremendous suffering, much like Job's family and says, I just, I should just die. And then the last word of the book is God saying it's a vine, dude. Paraphrases mine of vine. And you didn't even have it yesterday. How much more valuable is a city of a hundred and twenty thousand people who are paraphrases mine here, like sheep without a shepherd who can't tell their left hand from the right. And on top of that, how about just the animals? Should I not be concerned about that great city? Boom. And that's the end with that rhetorical question. And that's it for the book about a prophet who doesn't really do what God wants him to do except begrudgingly and who gets super mad when God shows compassion to people who aren't him. So why is this book in here? Well, one, again, it shows the sovereignty of God over history, over nature, over kings, all that kind of stuff. Two, it probably serves as some sort of historical theological explanation to his own people as to why God didn't wipe out the oppressive Assyrians sooner. Three, it's starting to really emphasize this idea that God is building a bigger family of faith and that his promise to Abraham back in the day that all the nations would be blessed is for real as we see outsiders who shouldn't get it, getting it, and an insider who should get it, not getting it, which for brings us to this place of personal introspection that I was talking about back at the beginning. I think this book is meant to take you on a fun roller coaster ride of adventures, but then you're supposed to get to the end and be like, Oh, dang it. I'm like Jonah. I can act like that. I can think this way and thinking like that makes no sense in terms of the grace of God and the mercy of God. But if he shows mercy to people, I didn't want him to show mercy to I need to get over myself and be grateful that God would ever relent and ever show compassion to anyone because I need that compassion to and maybe as a fifth little bonus bit here, there's tons of illusions to things that are going to happen in the life of Jesus and his teachings, especially as they're represented in the book of Matthew. When you visualize Jonah, just picture the big fish. It'll get you where you need to go. When you think about the theme, reflect on God's sovereignty and his love for outsiders and even his patience with somebody who doesn't like God's compassion when it's for other people and not for him. If you don't have time to read the whole thing and you should have time to read the whole thing, this one goes real quick. But if you don't, check out chapter two, which is Jonah's prayer inside that fish and chapter four, which is that dialogue between Jonah and God right there at the end. What a great book.
