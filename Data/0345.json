And so we're in the middle of unpacking what is really just another one of these brutal verbal beatdowns that Jesus gives to the religious leadership where he's making the point that our two visions for how to resolve the problem between God and man are really incompatible. So this is one of those ratcheting tension passages, one of these look back at the Old Testament passages. And well, we didn't quite pick up exactly where we left off because I just said all of this stuff. But mostly as promised yesterday, here's a little bit of music and then we'll just jump right back into it where we left off. So now back to Matthew 15. What Jesus is saying and what the original audience would have caught here is that the Pharisees have misplayed the game of one away. They've whipped on this gambit that they've made to step into these positions of spiritual leadership and be like. We have this covenant with God who is the one true God and we did not get things right in the first temple period. Disaster befell us, but we are going to provide disciplined, strategic, spiritual leadership with rules and details. We're going to expand the tradition. We are going to get it right this time. Listen to us. They make this play. And what Jesus is saying is you had a couple of things right. You had a couple numbers wrong and you didn't know which was which. So you took the things you were maybe getting right and flipped those to wrong, but the things you were getting wrong, you didn't understand that you were getting wrong. So you left those things alone and kept doing it. Now you're getting everything wrong. Paraphrase is very boldly mine. But come on. I mean, look what little clip Jesus grabs out of Isaiah 29. He says the prophet was talking about you guys, the religious leaders who completely missed the point, the honor me with your lips, but your heart isn't interested in me. And as evidence, Jesus would point to the thing he just got done saying that you ignore the actual commands of God for this weird bonus tradition you've made. And those bonus things just empower and entitle people to disobey the overt commands of God and enrich you. You guys are frauds. I can tell by your policies where your hearts are at, he is saying, and they are wrong. You now have all five numbers of one away incorrect. Your worship is in vain. The teachings that you guys are throwing out, they are but rules made by men. Jesus is denouncing the entire oral tradition. Now look, there might be things in the oral tradition that happened to overlap precisely with the law of God and not the least little dot of an eye or cross of a T is going to go away from that. That is all fulfilled in Christ. We don't ever see Jesus or the New Testament denounce the law as being a thing where God made a mistake. But remember, key verse of the entire book of Matthew, Matthew 5 17, Jesus clearly says, don't think that I've come to abolish the law and the prophets. I didn't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. Well pretty clearly based on what we're seeing here and in the eating grain in your hands on the Sabbath day controversy from a couple pages back, Jesus is not talking about being the fulfillment of the extra biblical oral law that is not from God, this tradition of the elders. That again, might happen to overlap with things God actually said at times, but all of the man made traditions that must have been going on that we see hinted at here in the text. Jesus not only isn't into that, he seems pretty willing to openly condemn it and dismiss it not just as unuseful or irrelevant, but as being in opposition to the actual character and actual law of God. Okay, look, at this point, it seems like we've had half a dozen or even a dozen of these little confrontations and they can start to feel like they're just all the same thing. These people are just butting heads, but there is a ratcheting up with each one of these exchanges. And there's a clarifying of Jesus position with each one of these exchanges that pushes his opponents further and further towards saying, our job is to be the caretakers of the land and to make sure our people get it right to honor the covenant God made with Moses. And this man right here is undercutting all of those efforts. He's putting us all in danger. His ideas are dangerous. They promote violence. He has to be stopped. He has to be silenced. It doesn't matter if his reasoning makes perfect sense. His ideas are absolutely devastating to our entire strategy and our entire game plan for making sure everything works out. And this guy, not us, has to go away and be dealt with. And when Jesus comes along and makes a sound regarding all five digits of the age old theological game of one away that the Pharisees have been playing, they're going to be furious because he's calling out everything they've done and everything they stand for coming out of this exchange. It's clear there is no compatibility between the game plan of Jesus for rightness with God and the game plan of the religious leaders for rightness with God. I got in my little stamps today. That little stamper it has my address on it and stuff. And so we're starting to put together the envelopes to send everybody who supports the program at patreon.com slash the TMBH podcast. We're sending literally everybody, no matter how long you've been supporting, even if it's only been for a day or at any level, even if it's for just a very modest amount, it just doesn't matter. I'm sending literally everybody who currently supports the podcast at literally any level. This cool little field notes book. This is TMBH Matthew on the front. So you can jot down notes and thoughts in there and that this will serve eventually as a trophy of accomplishment for getting to a place where much more so we have the book of Matthew. See what I'm doing here, literally and figuratively in our hip pocket, which is kind of the plan. So thanks everybody who supports the program. I don't know if I said already patreon.com slash the TMBH podcast. I super appreciate that and I can't stress this enough. Even if you do not support the podcast, that's awesome. And I just love that you're here and we get to do this together. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
