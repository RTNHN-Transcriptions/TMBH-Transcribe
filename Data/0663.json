They still do it a little bit now, but especially when they were smaller. They all wanted the middle seat in the back of the truck when we would go anywhere as a family. And there are five of us, three kids. And so they would sandbag or rush to try to make sure that they just sort of casually timed it so that they would get the middle seat. And of course, I grew weary of this game as the dad, but eventually we were asking, why does this even matter? It's such a debate. Kind of who cares. And they all said the same thing. They knew in their little world, it matters because whoever is in the middle gets access to mom and dad, gets access to both siblings, might even get access to the radio. It's just the sweet spot. That's where you want to be. And when I thought about it in their kid backseat micro economy, like, huh, yeah, okay, understand, there's some stakes there. I get it now. Likewise, when we think about the debate that is born out of Jesus words in Matthew 26 and exactly what he means here with phrases like, take and eat. This is my body or this is my blood, the covenant. And we listen to other people and find out that some folks read that very literally that there's an actual transformation that they understand to occur there where the elements of communion, though they are not visibly changed, they are changed at some level of the truest, realist substance. Or whether you're talking to someone who reads that and says, no, based on the rest of the New Testament, that is clearly metaphor. Either way, I get out somebody either in the church or outside of Christianity altogether could look at that and be like, I just don't see what the debates about. Like I get the debate and what the positions are, I just don't get why it matters. But again, in the same way that upon listening to my kids, I discovered that there actually were stakes to their backseat jockeying. So when you actually go and talk to Christians from different traditions, you discover that no, there actually are kind of stakes to this. And it makes sense that people care in this last conversation about the intention of Jesus words here at the last supper, I just want to tackle that one remaining question, which is why does this matter? What actually are the stakes? And I think the simplest way to break that down is like this. If a Christian reads Jesus words literally here, that there's a prayer that occurs and the bread and the wine literally become the body and the blood. And they're like, I just, I think that's a miracle that repeats all the time. I do think Jesus meant this literally. I do think there's some kind of union with God that is only fully realized in this lifetime by actually partaking of these transformed elements, which actually become the body and blood. But no, I still think that you're saved exclusively by faith through grace, through Christ alone. Well, then there's not really much of a debate here. The stakes are not that high. What you have in that case is just a healthy theological disagreement about how to read a couple of passages and how to interpret Jesus language in context. And while it might be fun to kick that around and while maybe even some people would get a little bit heated about that, the stakes would still be relatively low because I don't know. I'm a Christian who believes in Jesus and Bethany and so many words. I prayed that prayer of loyalty like we see back there in the sermon on the Mount and I am a son, a daughter, an heir of the king because of the work of the king exclusively and not because of anything that I did like says in the book of Ephesians, but it's by grace alone. So I got nothing I can boast in. Well, look, there's just not much to really fight about there. If both parties completely agree on that and one says there's a literal transformation and one says there is not a literal transformation of the elements where the stakes get higher would be with those Christians who would say, no, salvation occurs in so many words by participating in the body and blood of Christ by participating in the sacrifice of Christ through communion carried out properly by the proper expression of Christianity. And if you have not taken communion as administered by the true historic church, then your salvation might be in question because you have not properly and truly partaken of the body and blood of Christ. The key passage for that position would again be the stuff from John six that we looked at yesterday. When we look at the whole of John six, what we see is that it's not as cut and dried as some might make it out to be because Jesus pivots from the part where he says all the stuff about now, like you actually have to eat this and drink this. He then pivots to talking about the spirit gives life the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. So either position could be pretty effectively argued from John chapter six. So to say it again, maybe a little bit more simply, why does this debate matter? Well, it matters if it's tied to the question of salvation and by salvation, I mean the question of how does a person go from being an outsider to the kingdom to being a kingdom citizen? How does one go from not being a son, daughter, child, heir, agent of the kingdom to being a son, daughter, child, agent, heir of the king? How does one go from bearing the full responsibilities for human frailty and sin on their own shoulders to having the weight of all of that guilt and failure and frailty placed on Christ? Again, I unapologetically am a part of the Protestant tradition. I believe that salvation, the answer to those questions we were just talking about comes through faith alone by grace alone in Christ alone and that it is not a function of good works. Again, pointing back to Ephesians two that I referenced a minute ago, pointing to all of the book of Romans pointing to the most famous verse in the Bible, John 3 16, that whoever believes would not perish, but have eternal life. And even pointing back to the sermon on the Mount where Jesus offers a prayer of loyalty of fealty, a bending the knee, a repositioning, a foregoing the God of oneself to submit entirely to the true God, all of these things, full interpretive biases on display here in my mind and in my read point to a salvation by faith alone through grace alone in Christ alone. Now, very few Christians would listen to that and be like, ah, no, those things aren't good. I don't like faith or grace or Christ. And it's not fair at all to paint Christians from another tradition is not being in favor of those things. Oh, they like those things. It's just in one way or another. Some of those traditions have a more optimistic view of what rolled the actual institution of the church plays in mediating that salvation. And this is where it comes full circle. The Lord's Supper is that key linchpin for a lot of those traditions where those Christians would say, you can't really be in Christ unless you eat his flesh and drink his blood. And the only way to do that is through the transformation of the elements and the only people who are rightly equipped and ordained to do that are the true church, the Orthodox, those being the more Eastern Christians who would view themselves as being descended from all of the apostles and their authority would say that they are that continued true first expression of Christianity, the Western Catholic church would say, nope, we are descended from Peter. Peter was given the keys by Jesus. Peter established leaders who established leaders who established leaders. That is the true expression of Christianity. Some with an Anglicanism would say, no, we're connected all the way back to the beginning. Some within Lutheranism would say, no, we're connected all the way back to the beginning. Not all of those claims are necessarily exclusive. But once again, the linchpin there and the reason that really just structurally the high church needs to defend its turf a little bit and say, no, we really are the true expression of Christianity and the authority of Christ to do this miracle is handed down to us. That has to be defended if the Eucharist is literal, if the Lord's table is literal and literally the only way to give these life giving elements to people is to have it properly consecrated by a properly ordained priest from the proper spiritual lineage from the proper expression of Christianity that they would say dates back to the very, very beginning. Again, even here, my point is not to convince you of my thing. It's to help you understand why the tension exists. Usually, a belief that Jesus words in Matthew 26 are literal will have a natural connection to the belief that the church plays a mediating role in salvation and that the Lord's supper somehow is vital in that connectedness with God in a literal miraculous way that cannot happen apart from the proper taking of the Lord's table. If you view Jesus words here as metaphor, that will generally lead to a theological connection to the idea that the authority of a central expression of church is not the singular vision for Christianity for all of history and that the true communion is what was offered up at the cross and that people are not right with God because they participate in that very important ritual and remembrance, but rather that they are right with God because of the work of Christ on the cross, because of the forgiveness of God and through faith by grace in Christ alone. So in the same way that at first glance, the debate my kids have over who sits in what seat seems completely inconsequential and just a point of anthropological quirk that's enjoyable to observe from a distance. So at first glance, this debate about whether Jesus words should be taken literally or figuratively in Matthew 26 might seem like just another point of interesting theological discourse and debate. But there's a reason when you look a little bit closer that there are stakes to the kids in the back seat question and there's a reason when you look a little bit closer that there are stakes to this question because one's read on the literalness or metaphorical miss of Jesus words in Matthew 26 is going to cause a whole lot of very natural corresponding other theological beliefs to make sense one way or the other regarding how you view the church historically and where you go to church and how salvation happens, whether it is entirely a gift of faith and a gift of grace through Christ or whether the church or even very good and very important to human action and works play a role in that equation as well. In my continued attempt at full disclosure, I think the prior and have hesitations about the latter and also I'm so incredibly grateful for all of the allies and brothers and sisters I have who do not see this the same way. I think it's amazing that we name the same God that we care about the same book and that we're pulling in the same direction in terms of what the kingdom is and our role in it. This was the most sermony theological stuff we have done in a really long time. Thank you. That was my attempt to be thorough. We're going to get back to more fart jokes next time around. I'm Matt.
