It was a movie based on a video game. You know it's going to be good. It's called Gran Turismo. It's about some kids who are really good at a driving video game. So then they get to go and participate in a driving contest to drive real cars super fast. I did not enjoy it. So I left at the halfway mark. But you know if you liked it that's cool. I'm not saying that means it was a bad movie. It didn't work for me. It was very cliche. I mean it was about a hundred times where the sheriff from Stranger Things kept saying stuff. It's just a NVIDIA video game guys. Real life you can't just reach that button. You can't just reset it. I felt like a yellow redundant. So I left and that's okay. But there was one moment that I really liked in there. There's a moment between two brothers, a little sibling rivalry going on there. And the younger brother, he doesn't get a lot of credit in his family. The older brother gets credit because he's into sports and stuff like his dad likes. So the younger brother when they get in a bit of a pickle with the law, he's like, hey, I will take the fall for this. But you have to say I'm a better driver and older brothers like, no way. And the younger brother is like, I'm driving man. Here comes a guy, his dad or the cop or whoever it was. We're going to get in trouble. Just say the words. And finally the brother relancies. I find you're the better driver. I think that's more or less how it went. And that I kind of liked because I can relate to that kind of rivalry that you probably can too. Right? It's not that big a thing. But sometimes just bragging rights and having somebody else admit something like that that is currency in your relationship or your family or your circle of friends. That's a thing. And maybe mostly we grow out of it. Maybe sports still brings that back out in us. But I thought it was a fun and relatable moment in an otherwise very forgettable movie. It would be really easy when we pick up the book of Esther to get to Esther chapter six and to this hilarious reversal of fortune that happens here where Mordecai looks like he's about to get impaled and hung up for everybody to see. And Heyman looks like he's about to get everything he wants. And the whole thing just flips around and it's hilarious the way it flips around. It would be really easy to look at this and imagine the way the original audience would understand it or the way that we're intended to understand it is that kind of thing like a rivalry between two squabbling siblings representative of two different tribes who don't like each other very much. And the one finally gets over on the other one just about the time. It looks like the other one is going to get over on the other one. And ha ha that's kind of fun. And maybe there's a little bit of that. I mean the the playfulness of the way it's written here in the book of Esther gives us the impression that it's okay to just revel in it in that way a little bit as a reader. But I think it was a much bigger deal in terms of how the original audience would have thought about the actual ceremony the actual acknowledgement of the superiority and the greatness of Mordecai that ends up being inflicted on his enemy. Heyman the bad guy the enemy of the Jews and the whole thing because it's not just that Mordecai in the text you know gets to stand up on a balcony and then Heyman has to be like you're very good. You're better at some things than me there. I said it and then Mordecai is like ha ha you heard him say it everybody and they all have a big laugh and then they go eat together whatever it's not like that. Instead effectively what Mordecai is given here and this word is not used in the text and it's a little bit of anachronistic because it's a word that gets used a couple hundred years later from when this was written but it's a very real thing. What Mordecai is getting here is effectively a triumph. He is getting a parade of conquest and glory. He is being declared king for a day which is what a triumph was back in the day. In other words if there's any way to move into the highest position of honor possibly imaginable in the ancient or classical world it would be one step shy of the king king for a day which outranks Haman in that regard and that is the honor that ends up being afforded Mordecai at the expense of Haman. It really is just delightful and we see this in a Persian context here with the way that Heyman outlined what should be done for the man in whom the king delights. How should he be honored? It's like well I'm obviously going to be the one who's honored here so I want all the king things. I want to be king for a day. I want to be lifted up and so he says he wants to have a royal robe that the king is worn and he wants to ride on a horse if the king is ridden and he wants the royal crest that is for the king of course placed upon its head that being the head of the horse and then he wants to be led around with all of this king stuff on him and even one of the king's princes has to act like whoever is on this kingly horse wearing this kingly robe with the kingly crest kind of is the king that's sort of what it communicates and there's an interesting detail to here if this kind of procession were to occur through town you got to understand that a lot of people would mistake whoever is on that horse for the king because it's not like now everybody knows at least in my country everybody knows the current president as I'm sitting here recording this is Joe Biden and I mean you know you can make whatever you want to of the state of the presidency I certainly don't think we are at the apex here in the last several administrations of honor and respectability in that role but it's still president of the United States it's a pretty big deal so you know it's the closest thing we can approximate to the idea of a king in my culture at least but everybody knows what Joe Biden looks like if Joe Biden came into town in his limo and windows were rolled down he was driving around he went and slurped on some ice cream which seems to kind of be what he wants to do when he goes to small towns it's sort of his relatable thing every president has one well everybody would be like well that there's Joe Biden you know how I can tell the same way I can tell what an Aspen tree is because of how it is look at his face that's Joe Biden we got TV we got photography we got Meg I mean Joe Biden's face is in front of you all the time right now but that wasn't the case in the ancient world most subjects of a king would go their entire lives without ever seeing the king nor having any really sense of what the king actually looked like it's why it was a somewhat plausible suggestion decades before these events when Darius grabbed the throne for him to suggest that no it's an impersonator he's taking the place of party of the rightful king it was my job to kill the impersonator well how would anybody know no the common people don't know what party looks like the common people couldn't tell the difference between him and some sort of imposter I mean I mean there's accusations of body doubles going around even to this day so nobody knew what Xerxes looked like meaning that Haman's plan was that he wanted to be trotted around town and have people be like oh my gosh is that the king I think that's the king hail king Xerxes and fall on their faces before him he wanted to feel what it was like to have people adore him and Haman really liked having people adore him how do we know because he said so this many pages earlier that was the sound of one page turning because he just admitted that he's super happy about everything but super mad that one guy won't pay him the respect that he deserves so it's crazy it's like Haman won the make a wish contest and he gets to pick whatever he wants and what he wants is to be inside the king's skin just like him to dress up just like you and have people call me by your name and get to imagine that I'm you and what it feels like to be you gross this is gross when you think about what he really was asking for here and instead this honor that Haman conceives of in a really creepy way but that the original audience would conceive of as being really genuinely a great honor instead it goes to Mordecai who isn't even asking for it and who doesn't even want it and the next passage here in Esther 6 it unfolds exactly the way you would expect it to unfold and everything that Haman asked for is what ends up happening go at once the king commanded Haman get the robe and the horse just as you've suggested for Mordecai the Jew records grads wait what who sits at the king's gate do not neglect anything you have recommended yesterday I liken this to a hilarious moment in musical theater where the orchestra would play a big thump on the drum and maybe there'd be a down slide on the trombone or something like that as Haman realizes what happened and overreacts I think you could also imagine this and like what do they even call it now world wrestling entertainment just professional wrestling they have to way over act because for all intents and purposes it is a stage performance and people can't really see their faces they can only see the body language and wrestlers they over act real big and when somebody says something or disses them like their whole body contorts wait what huh look around the entire stadium that guy just said that thing it's so animated and over the top and I just picture Haman responding and that kind of gigantic overly expressive manner that the audience can really revel in then verse 11 it says so Haman got the robe and the horse he robed Mordecai in other words Haman had to put that on his shoulders quivering with anger clinching his teeth and led him on horseback through the city streets proclaiming before him the addendum is mine right here in front of everybody this is what is done for the man the king delights to honor and obviously there's a ton to break down here in terms of the dynamic between Haman and Mordecai but I want to take another day before we get into all of that and pay off what we started talking about here at the beginning of this conversation and that is the idea of a triumph I don't think this is just a hi hi got you you had to admit that I'm better in the king likes me more kind of thing I think this is much more significant than that and I think what we're seeing here is more patterned after the idea of one of these glorious triumphs of old which is something that we happen to know quite a bit about from extra biblical sources and I think we're gonna have fun breaking that down next time around I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.76,
