And that is for the guy who is gruff and battle-hardened and scarred, but still has a soft spot for people who are vulnerable. Like Wolverine in the Marvel comic books is one of these characters where, let me literally as knives come out of his hands. He lives in constant torture. We have a term that occasionally gets used in our family's circle of friends, the Wolverine hunch. It's that thing that you finally do where you put your head down and your shoulders up when it's like, that's enough. Just give me a little space back off. Everything about this character, as he's been written over the decades, is off-putting, give me my distance. I will fight and scrap if you put me in a corner. So it just doesn't seem like there would be any tenderness there. But also the way this character has been written over the decades is such that he will invest deeply in the protection of and even the development of and mentoring of a kid who comes across his path, who is in need of such a figure in his life. I think this archetype is pretty popular right now because of the Mandalorian as well. I mean, this is what the Mandalorian is. I mean, the guy's literally in a warring battle, weapon warrior's death cult thing, but he takes care of a little baby green frog yoda thing. I think everybody likes that. Same exact actor. Also just had a big hit on HBO with a video game movie, The Last of Us, where the same thing, he looks out for somebody who's not his kid and he's been hardened and scarred by the years. He's been through trauma, but yet he can still muster this part of his heart or maybe it's the kid that unlocks this part of his heart. It's just a cool age old mechanism in storytelling. And I think we're seeing a little bit of that here in the book of Esther in chapter two in terms of who this Mordecai guy is and his relationship with his cousin, the namesake of the book Esther. Esther chapter two, verse five, we read this a bunch yesterday. I'm going to read it again just to give you the whole context. Now there wasn't the Citadel of Susa, Jew of the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai, son of Jair, the son of Shimiye, the son of Kish, who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, among those taken captive with Yahweh, King of Judah. Mordecai had a cousin named Tadasa. She had neither father nor mother. This girl who was also known as Esther was lovely and form and features and Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died. Look, with the stuff we were talking about over the last couple of days with Mordecai, it's not really about him. We didn't learn anything about him other than he's been through this terrible trauma and maybe other than a few details that the author of Esther wants to frame up for us about what had happened to the Jewish people and why Mordecai was maybe one of those who still lived in Persia and this prominent city of Susa, maybe we're supposed to catch that he's descended from somebody named Kish and that's maybe supposed to harken back for the original reader to the name of the father of the first king of the United Kingdom of Israel, that being Saul, his dad's name was Kish. But there's not a lot there to go on. We don't really get a sense of this guy's heart or what kind of character we're going to be dealing with other than I think the most obvious thing is the trauma. He's descended from this horrible cultural calamity and has cultural memory, if not living memory of what happened there. But as soon as it pivots into this little girl that gets introduced to the story, well now things are different because somewhere along the line, he had some family members who had a daughter, I guess it would be his aunt and uncle and they died and this little girl had nobody. And so apparently this Mordecai fellow who was descended from massive cultural calamity had his own demons and personal trauma and who as we see as the story goes along is pretty shrewd and worldwide and street wise. This guy with some of those Wolverine or Joel or the Mandalorian kind of qualities, he swoops in and takes responsibility for this young lady. And I think of another one of these examples, the harsh and gruff uncle Argyle from the Braveheart show who ends up being the mentor to William Wallace. He doesn't just protect William Wallace. He inculturates William Wallace. He raises William Wallace in the ways of the highlanders and makes him a sophisticated thinker who understands his own people and the larger world. He gives away his heritage and his skill set. And I think as the story of Esther unfolds, what we see is that Mordecai did that as well. He didn't just look out for this girl and make sure she didn't get robbed on the street or something worse. He clearly imparted to her a whole skill set of social sophistication and understanding how people are and how others are wired and how to talk to people because all of that is on magnificent display as we work through the rest of the book. I think that behind the scenes and these couple of sentences I just read you are years and years of training montage and investment. I choose to believe though I can't totally prove it from the text that there is a real tenderness between these two as well. And I don't think that the fact that Esther ends up being taken away into this competition, this dark pageant that is about to happen. I don't think it's necessarily a reflection on Mordecai being a bad caregiver or being a cruel caregiver. Maybe one could argue that Mordecai did a great job and was very protective in mentoring in a whole bunch of different ways but maybe it could be said that he should have done more to protect Esther from going into this situation. But again, I think the practical thinking person would have known that this charge of mine, this cousin of mine who I've raised and shown care to, she's lovely and form and feature. That's the only thing we learn about Esther right off the bat. Now there's an elephant in the room here though. I suppose it could be argued that Mordecai should have done more to protect Esther from this difficult situation. She was about to be thrust into. And yeah, maybe with modern sensibilities, maybe. But at the same time, Mordecai is clearly a practical thinker, clearly a competent thinker. And he looks at this young lady as she's growing up to become a young woman. Like anybody with eyes, he can tell that she has these defining characteristics of form and beauty. She's elegant. She's lovely. She's going to marry somebody. That she's not going to be some kind of spinster. This is going to happen. And I think what Mordecai is probably doing here and what I think he could be praised for is he's trying to get her the best imaginable match that he possibly can in a culture where this matchmaking is not entirely lovely as we think of lovely matchmaking in modern civilization. If she's going to effectively get married off to someone in an arranged marriage because that's how it happens, Mordecai is probably doing her a great mercy or so he imagines by trying to set her up to be married off to the most powerful person on all of planet earth. Now, we're going to see a moment down the road where Mordecai and Esther have what could be described as a little bit of family tension. Mordecai is certainly firm with her at one point on what she ought to be doing next on what the courageous and right thing to do would be. Then we'll unpack that when we get to it. I'm not saying this guy was perfect. I'm not saying the situation is perfect. But I do see a character trait here that is one that I've come to admire anytime I see it in storytelling or in real life. And it's the rough, gruff dude who's taken a beating over the course of his life, but somehow has that little sliver of softness and tenderness and nurturing left within him. And then oftentimes it is a little girl who comes along and reawakens that part of the character and then beautiful things come out of the story, even if those beautiful things still have elements of gruffness and bumblingness. If anything, that's part of the charm. And looking beyond just the character of Mordecai here, bigger picture for the whole book, I think we're seeing one more little element of the providential themes of the book of Esther. God is not mentioned, but he's working all of this stuff together for something good for something redemptive before anybody knows it even needs to be worked together. And if Mordecai doesn't make this investment in young Esther, young Hadassah, then she would never have been positioned in that moment of need for such a time as this to do something that only she was in position to do. So I kind of enjoy looking at this little bit of text and seeing God using one of my favorite archetypes to raise up someone who could be courageous, brave and well positioned and to bring about his redemptive plans. Pretty cool. We're going to start trying to figure out if there's more to this Esther girl than just being lovely, informed and figure as we look at the next few verses in all of this tomorrow.
