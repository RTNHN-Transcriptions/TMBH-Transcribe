Matt Whitman this the ten minute Bible hour podcast and I'm going with an example today that I think will really help us understand the Bible text we're looking at but also the dislike to get everybody's hackles up and make people feel weird and we're doing it anyway do you guys remember a while back when the black lives matters movement was kind of its apex and that phrase was floating around out there and there were some people who would be like really enthusiastic about you need to say that phrase you need to post it on your social media that shows that you get it the other people would be like I don't know I'd rather say all lives matter because I think all lives matter and these two groups that had a preference one way or the other kind of talking past each other a little bit but the first crowd would be like no if you don't specifically say black lives matter then what you say you're minimizing the struggle and issues with historical systemic racism these other things that we perceive in society and then the crowd that wanted to say no I think all lives matters good they were saying basically like I'm not sure everything is as racist as you think and I think you're maybe not paying as much attention to other lives as you could as well I'm making no statement about whether you should say black lives matter or all lives matter I think both statements are probably accurate but that was a very politically charged slight distinction in language in our recent past now five years from now ten years from now a hundred years from now a thousand years from now people are probably gonna look back on that be like what is the big deal the both of those statements are true and it's probably fine I don't get it but if you were alive a year ago you know exactly how loaded that stuff was because that's just where the debate was that's where our heads were at that's what was on the news and that little slight difference in how you phrase that phrase about lives mattering which I'm glad everybody on both sides of that discussion think the lives matter I mean we can at least be happy about that right but that slight little distinction it carried a ton of weight and it was kind of a litmus test for how somebody views the world and you could glean so much from just that tiny tiny little thing that difference of just a few letters well if you can understand that in your day and age when you've got your finger on the pulse of society and you know the mass of implications of saying something that in any other moment in history would have been completely innocuous and harmless then I think you can understand what's going on in Matthew chapter 22 and indeed the whole New Testament era it looks like there was some kind of debate that was going on about exactly what to make of the Messiah and particularly I get the impression from reading the New Testament that a pivot phrase in figuring out where people stood on the question of what the Messiah would look like and who we might be was this reference to Psalm 1 10 1 that we've been looking at over the last few days the passage we're on is the very end of Matthew chapter 22 it goes like this while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them I think very nicely what do you think about the Christ whose son is he the son of David they replied he said to them how is it then that David calls him Lord for he says the Lord said to my Lord sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet if then David calls him Lord how can he be his son and then it says nobody could say a word and reply and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions and for the breakdown of this little exchange and the narrative and for a closer look at the text that is being referenced here you can go and check out the last two episodes of the podcast but I think it's interesting to note how much seems to have hinged on this seemingly innocuous little bit cryptic phrase from Psalm 1 10 that said in the same way I think people who are old 50 years from now will be able to explain to young people why Black Lives Matter versus all lives matter had meaning and weight depending on which phrase you chose so I'm also optimistic that you and I can peel back the layers and pretty easily understand why this particular phrase this particular verse was such a big deal and how Jesus is encouraging the Pharisees to rightly interpret it here as we've discussed it would seem that nobody was really debating that David wrote this that it was from God and that there are three parties present in this particular verse Josephus the first century Jewish historian even gives us some extra biblical corroboration of what the common thought was in that day amongst the Jewish people regarding David in his antiquities of the Jews which is written in the late first century he writes in chapter 8 so Samuel when he had given him these admonitions went away but the divine power departed from Saul and removed to David who upon this removal of the divine spirit to him began to prophesy that is David is prophesying but as for Saul some strange and demonic disorders came upon him and brought upon him such suffocations as we're ready to choke him for which the physicians could find no other remedy but this that if any person could charm those passions by singing and playing upon the harp they advised them to inquire for such a one and to observe when these demons came upon him and disturbed him to take care that such a person might stand over him and play upon the harp and recite hymns to him so even though Josephus in that passage is obviously talking about the relationship between King Saul and David and all the things that ended up happening with Goliath the Philistine and all of that business he still in passing is acknowledging that the shared assumption of the Jewish people is that God's spirit was upon David and that God's spirit was behind what David was writing and singing and behind these artistic attributes and this almost I guess you'd have to call it prophetic wisdom that he's throwing out so David wrote it it was from God and inarguably it looks like there are three parties present David the author and then the Lord who says to my Lord so three people are here according to what David wrote the Lord that being God is telling David's Lord that being Christ the Messiah to sit at his right hand and David is witness to this conversation why does that matter because it looks like the Pharisees and the original audience members were conceiving of the Messiah as being somehow subservient to David because this promise to David was about the Messiah sitting on his throne and this eternal throne and all of this business there's this misconception about the Messiah that they had in their heads and Jesus is trying to push back on that he's effectively saying you're right when you say the Messiah is the son of David but the Messiah also pre-exists David the Messiah is also the maker and sustainer of all things fully participatory in creation you are way underselling what you imagine the Messiah to be so I think part of what Jesus is suggesting here is that hey guys like you're all tangled up in this debate about is it this phrase or is it that phrase or what do we do with this little play on words and the people who twist the play on words that way they're super wrong and the people who twist it this way they're super right Jesus is saying you're thinking inside the box you got to think outside the box to understand God the Messiah is the son of David and the master of David simultaneously the Messiah is descended from David and also the initiator of all things and all of creation simultaneously and you don't have to desperately read between the lines of this text to try to come up with that conclusion it's all over the new testament maybe most famously in John 8 Jesus says truly I tell you before Abraham was even born I am and of course that I am was an inarguable declaration of deity because I am is the name of God and everybody that Jesus was talking to in that environment in John 8 would have totally understood that Paul fleshes out this idea in Colossians one go eat popcorn Christ is the image of the invisible God the first born overall creation for by him all things were created things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities all things were created by him and for him he is before all things and in him all things hold together and he is the head of the body the church and he is the beginning and the first born from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy for God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on the cross is there anything in the Bible that talks about David that way I'm just going to save you a bunch of times you don't have to go read the whole thing right now to get back to me no no that's just not how David is presented at all David is a conflicted flawed character who on the plus side has a heart after gods and on the downside has a heart like the rest of us too that is corruptible and will chase after stupid things even violent things if need be the guy made a whole bunch of mistakes but God made promises to him that were unconditional and God demonstrates the quality of his character and the reliability of his promises through his dealings with David but Jesus the Christ the Messiah that is a totally different animal so you can understand when we read that language from Colossians chapter one when we hear Jesus declaration about himself before Abraham was even born I am from John chapter eight it's pretty easy to see how short the Pharisees were selling the concept of the Messiah if they're thinking that he is somehow lesser than David or that because he's descended from David the David would somehow be his lord when the reality is no he pre-exists David he transcends David in power and in character and in authority and part of the reason the Pharisees are missing the pointer is not just because they're bad people I mean they behave badly oftentimes in the text but it's because they're just thinking about the whole proposition the wrong way and so part of this last ditch effort to make the eyebrows go up in the middle and shake sense into these guys gently is trying to get them to more rightly conceive of the entire proposition of the notion of the Messiah in general. Final thought you know what's awesome what's awesome is that a whole bunch of you have left reviews about this podcast on the internet that makes a gigantic difference I was thumbing through some of those again the other day and man I appreciate you taking the time to do that it makes us of the more people are part of the conversation and that's probably my favorite thing about it but I'm not going to lie the parts where I get to hear a few encouraging things here and there doesn't hurt either.
