And I'll tell you in the Bible, I'll have a podcast. It's an have an episode, an have an episode. Of the 10 really Bible hour, I'll have a podcast. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. And as I record this, we are inching up on Christmas this year. And the last couple of Saturdays, we've done a bonus episode to anticipate together the celebration of the arrival of the king. We've been looking at this grand text, this age-old book of Matthew that gives us the description of how gigantic Christ's arrival is to not just that moment, not just this book, not just this religion, but like everything. The Bible holds that out as being the pivotal moment in all of the history of existence. And the rest of the book of Matthew walks us through how it all played and why it is that pivotal moment in the history of existence. But Christmas, for centuries and centuries now, has been a time of year that we kind of arbitrarily picked to celebrate this and to reflect on this key pivotal moment of all of history. And so the last couple of weeks, we've spent some time looking in the old Testament at stuff that was meant to build that sense of anticipation toward the arrival of the Messiah, the one who was going to straighten everything out, the one who would be this pivot point, centerpiece character, centerpiece actor in God's redemptive plan. But then last week, we consider the fact that for several hundred years, it seems like the story kind of goes dormant. And during that time, people's expectations for what the Messiah will be branch out and deviate into a whole bunch of different things. And there really is a theological crisis surrounding the Messiah and God's intervention that the whole God-believing world was steeped in at the time that Jesus shows up, politics had entered into the equation. And as we talked about last time of all the ways that anybody would have expected God to break into the mess and resume his very obvious, very pronounced, redemptive work. You just wouldn't have guessed that it would be with a teenage girl in a backwater town out in the sticks of the lesser of the two predominantly Jewish provinces within the Roman Empire at that time, that being Galilee. And yet that's what God did. The angel Gabriel shows up and we looked at that exchange last time around. And we left it with Mary hearing this scary, intimidating, world-changing pronouncement and saying simply, may it be to me as you have said. But then a little bit after that, what we see is that Mary compares notes with her cousin Elizabeth, who's had a similar greeting and is in the middle of a somewhat similar, though more natural pregnancy, that is going to bring about the birth of John the Baptist and John the Baptist is going to be the forerunner of Jesus. So in Luke two, I'm sorry, Luke one 39, we pick it up right here. At that time, Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea. This is right after she has the encounter with the angel where she entered Zachariah's home and greeted Elizabeth when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit in a loud voice she exclaimed, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the child you will bear. But why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby and my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished. And there's so many illusions and references in all of this so many beginnings of completion to Old Testament stuff, even a narrative rhyme with what was positively stated about Abraham. Remember the guy with whom all of these promises that God would deliver through these people that eventually the promises make it clear that this child is going to come out of all this. I mean the the physical human father of all of this line, all of this people, all of this stuff God's chosen people is Abraham and what was the deal with Abraham and belief? Well he believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness. Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished. Again highlighting that this is a kid how on earth could she be expected to get this right and somehow by the grace of God, by whatever God built into her character, she does get it right and there's this confirmation that the world still isn't seeing at all but to two expectant moms who understand something that I will never understand, two expectant moms who were attuned to who these little babies are that they're carrying and also they have supernatural attunement to what's going on. They get something these two ladies do. They see something that nobody else staring at the situation could see and then we get this beautiful song from Mary and maybe she wrote this song while she was on a road trip to go to where Elizabeth and Zechariah lived. I don't know when she composed this. Some people think that maybe this was spontaneous. I tend to think that this was her keeping all this stuff and storing it up and treasuring it in her heart and mulling it over and that this is what it ends up looking like. So then in verse 46 Mary said, my soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices and God my Savior, for he's been mindful of the humble state of his servant from now on all generations will call me blessed. Yep, for the mighty one has done great things for me. Holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him from generation to generation. He's performed mighty deeds with his arm. He's scattered those who are proud in their and most thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever even as he said to our fathers. Look, if you've been hanging out with me and working through the book of Matthew, you know that the themes of the king and the kingdom and the values of the kingdom, some of which Jesus is articulating in new expanded very fresh ways but all of those values are evident in the Old Testament as well. Then if you've been tracking with me on that, if you've been seeing how that unfolds over the book of Matthew, then we realize Mary is way ahead of the game here. She is making connections that the religious elites, many of them, will never make. She is seeing who God is and what he's done through new lenses. Maybe she was very familiar with the scriptures. Maybe she didn't make all of these connections right when the angel was there. Maybe all she could say is just it may be to me as you have said. Maybe she was shrugging when she said that because she really hadn't thought it through. But whether that's a case or not in the interim, she has thought it through. She has reevaluated, reexamined what she knows about what God has done in the past, what the story of her and her people is. She's reexamined all of the promises about the Messiah, stuff that pops in Psalm 18, Habakkuk 3, Isaiah 17, Psalm 138, Psalm 71, Psalm 111, Psalm 103, Isaiah 40. Her song is so full of Old Testament Bible stuff that we don't have time to break down. It's probably the best on-screen integration of Old Testament writing with the work of the Messiah that we see in all of the book of Luke until the very final chapter when her son, Jesus himself, is talking with the people on the road to Emmaus and off camera explains and opens up their eyes to the Old Testament and how it fulfills and completes everything. Matthew is making all of these connections, but he's got the benefit of decades of time and having seen who Jesus was and what he did. Mary is making all of these connections after one, two paragraph conversation with an angel and just reflecting on what she already knew. So we look at all of that and I guess the take-home of our conversation could be, Mary is amazing and all of the things that people say about her are justified. She truly is probably the most faithful character we get in the gospel narratives. She's clearly the most important woman in the entire Bible. She should be called blessed by all generations just as she says in this song just as Elizabeth pronounces toward her. We could spend a whole bunch of time being like, look how amazing she is or we could say, look at how exemplary she is for the people who've come after the fact. If with what she had in front of her, she could connect to these dots. If with what limited education she had, with what limited age she had, she could look at this whole story in the back catalog of what we call the Bible. I'd be like, oh wow, it's all completed here. It all comes together. It all comes together in Jesus in my son. If she could do that, we could do that. If we can understand this document too, we can anticipate with our eyes wide open and see the structure to this story and see the implications of this as well. And I suppose both can be true. It's really valid to come away from a text like this and be like, wow, look at how the Bible holds out God as being. That is incredible. If true, that's the biggest deal in all of history and I think it is true. Two, Mary is remarkable. She is unique among women. She's unique among people and is rightly celebrated. What an incredible example. What an incredible composition. Go Mary. This is incredible. Three. Wow. Look at how all of this story hangs together. Look at what all of it points to. Look at how all of this demonstrates just how pivotal Jesus Christ is as the central physical as we understand it character of the entire Bible and the central character of all of history and the central character of the redemptive plan. There's a whole lot in this little passage that helps us do what we're trying to do with this Advent time and that is anticipate. Thanks for hanging out with me. I hope your Christmas season has been spectacular thus far. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
