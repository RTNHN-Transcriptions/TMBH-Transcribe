This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Get ready for some introspection because I'm in a mood to do that right now. When I was little, the scariest things I could imagine were outside of me in probably sixth grade. I illegally went to a movie with my friends because I wasn't 13 yet and my parents didn't give me permission. It was critters and critters. They're space aliens. They roll up in little balls and they roll around and then they look kind of harmless, but then they unroll and you're like, whoa, those are huge teeth and they eat your face or your neck or something like that. It's very troubling. But for the longest time, the scariest stuff I could picture was all external to me. And then as time has gone on, it occurs to me that the stuff I am most scared of is no longer that. Don't give me a ride. That stuff's still scary and you can still jump scare me. But what I am most scared of is not self-awareness and you're like, oh, dude, well, I hate to be the one to tell you, but you may be able to problem with that. I do have a problem with that. What I mean by that though is that I'm terrified of charging ahead and being like, oh, well, in a world full of opinions, I have formulated one and I'm pretty sure I'm right and I'm going to do this. Big, proud in front of everybody. This is my plan. And then it turns out that I was wrong about all of that. And now all of the standards that I put out there and the big, full-throated boasts that I put out there about how things ought to be come crashing back down on me. And so right now I am doing this thing where when I'm alone, I picture the cringiest moments from earlier in my life. And I mean my friends way back in life. We're talking like elementary school stuff. We're talking even little kids stuff, middle school, high school, trying to figure out how to kiss a girl in high school, trying to figure out how to be cool on a field trip in eighth grade, like silly little things where I didn't wrong anybody, but I just came off like an idiot and I hurt. It'll just occur to me like while I'm mowing the lawn and I hurt because the standards of reality that now maybe I'm a touch more aware of come into full focus in contrast to stupid stuff I've done before. And it's not the stupid stuff in and of itself. It's that being held up in contrast to reality that hurts so bad. And when I'm on my best days, I just have a laugh about it and like, well, we're all idiots. And to some extent, we just have to be forgiving of our past selves and our ignorance and our insecurities. And I think that's probably a pretty good way to respond to it. But sometimes I just can't muster that because I feel, well, that weird phobia that shame, is that the word? That sense of dread of I was pretty sure this was the right way to go. And I went this way in front of a lot of people and then reality makes it clear to me. It wasn't. I set up standards. I declared that this is the way things are. And then those weren't real. Those weren't true. And so one of the most horrifying passages in the whole Bible in light of that is all the way back in 1 Samuel 12. And you're like, ah, we talk about Matthew here. What are we doing back here? Ah, we're getting somewhere. Trust me. Back in 1 Samuel 12, you get this scenario where David just did the worst thing David ever did. And then David, time goes by and he just gets back to work on things being king, being right about everything. And then Nathan, the prophet who was always working with David comes along and he tells him this story. And he's like, wow, there's this, this sheep and this guy owns it and this other guy comes along and is selfish and mistreats the poor guy who owns this sheep. And it's a little parable in a sense. And David doesn't read the parable properly. Nathan tells David this story and David is outraged. He rushes right to his metaphorical keyboard or phone. He's like, I'm retweeting that story. That is garbage. And he metaphorically re-tweets it and his tweet to go along with the retweet is as surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this right here in the article, I'm retweeting deserves to die. And he probably felt very impressive. Morally, he rolled that standard right out. He took the opportunity to let me really, why do we do that to point out how dumb and bad and immoral everyone else is, but how on the right side of things he is or we are when we do that kind of stuff. And then here comes the hammer. Verse seven of second Samuel 12, maybe the scariest verse in all of the Old Testament. Then Nathan said to David, you are that man. And I picture one of those multi-level zooms where the background and the foreground don't work together in a normal way like when Simba realizes that the wildebeest herd is coming down the canyon. And David, in an instant, must have realized he had dug his own grave. Without knowing that this was about him, he proclaimed his judgment as king, his judgment as one so wise. These are my actual moral standards. And in doing so, exposed that he is a fraud. In an attempt to thump his chest and bring attention to his own awesomeness and masquerade his virtue signaling as concern for justice for this hypothetical person, he got exposed and he painted himself into a corner. And the reason this passage is scary is because I have done that not once, not twice, but uncountable times. And the internet has only afforded me more opportunities to make that not just cringy mistake. It's cringy when you're a kid, that dangerous mistake. So then you fast forward to the sermon on the mountain. You get the Lord's prayer and we think of that as just being a teaching on prayer, but it is deeply connected to teaching that comes right after it on forgiveness. And the idea is, if this kingdom is beautiful to you, if this king is the kind of king that you think you should bend the knee to, that being Jesus, the ticket to admission is forgiveness. Now, ultimately it's God's unmerited forgiveness that enables anybody to enter the presence of this perfect king because nobody's good enough to achieve that by their own merit. But then the thing that demonstrates that you get the values of the kingdom, that you get the king, that you're loyal to the king, that you love the king, that you're bought into what the king is about and what he's doing is that you give away that forgiveness that you were given in the first place. And then you skip forward a few verses from that part of the sermon on the mountain. One of the very next things you run into is that business at the beginning of Matthew chapter seven, where it says, don't worry about the speck in your brother's eye. Worry about the log in your own eye because the measure you choose, that's the one that will be applied to you. Surely the original audience thought of second Samuel 12 and what happened between David and Nathan. It's maybe the most famous example in the Bible of somebody getting that exactly wrong and then being confronted with the aha moment that comes with it. Fast forward to the community life discourse in Matthew chapter 18 and the parable that dominates the second half of that that we've been looking at for the last few days. And you have somebody who does the same thing. I want one standard for myself and I want one standard for everybody else. I want grace and forgiveness for me, but I want permission to look at other people with a spirit of judgment and hatred and condemnation with no social awareness of my own problems or what I have been given or rather forgiven. The parable then of the unmerciful servant who is forgiven $312 million worth of debt for no apparent reason, certainly not by merit of his own character and then can't turn around and forgive a relatively very small sum from someone else is meant to conjure in us the same rage that was conjured in David in second Samuel 12. You're supposed to get to the end of that parable and be like, that is garbage. Who is that clown? Who does something like that? We should all join together in condemning that unmerciful servant. In fact, I'm going to tweet about this right now. Okay, let me see. I'm just going to go to this parable. I mean, it retweet and now my little tweet to go along with it is going to be, this guy was an idiot and horrible man. This is what's wrong with the world today, except then implicitly right at the end of that is the voice of Nathan, the prophet speaking with the voice of God or maybe the voice of God himself or maybe just the voice of reason and common sense saying, yeah, that unmerciful servant. You are that man. You are that woman. You are the one who wants one standard of forgiveness for yourself and another standard of forgiveness for everyone else. This parable is not one to be marveled at from a distance as we gawk at how awful the wrong character is in this thing. This parable is supposed to make you feel like the will to be sir coming down the canyon and that crushing camera zoom shot comes in as you realize it's me. I'm the one who has the problem. I'm the one who needs forgiveness. I'm the one who needs forgiveness the most. I'm the one who doesn't give it away enough. The truth of the matter is I want to handle all of this in one block of thought. So I'm just going to keep recording here and roll right into tomorrow's episode picking up exactly where we left off and thinking about the same stuff. I'm Matt.
