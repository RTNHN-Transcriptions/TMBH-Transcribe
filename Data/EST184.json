This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and we have been working through a book that came out in 1909 called Legends of the Jews by Lewis Ginsburg, and it's got this huge section on oral tradition and other written traditions and really legends surrounding the story of Esther. Yesterday, we spent some time looking at some of the most interesting ones in the first half of the book, and today we're going to take some time to look at some other interesting ones, and then we're going to consider what the existence of all of these goofy, fun, juicy legends means for our evaluation of Esther in the big historical sense. All right, I'm going to have my buddy Jeff play some music, and we're going to get back after it. There's lots of super fascinating stuff here. I'm having to be selective, but I'm trying to go, you can see what I'm doing. I'm trying to go chronologically through this story, so we're kind of paralleling what we already read. There's a great legend here about the conspiracy to kill the king, and Esther and Xerxes have this crazy showdown. She's very direct. The king asks Esther, whose daughter art thou? And Esther says, and whose son art thou? And Xerxes says, I'm a king, and I'm the son of a king. And Esther says, and I'm a queen, the daughter of kings, a descendant of the royal family of Saul. Whoa, she just comes right out and says that she's Jewish according to this legend. Well, that takes a lot of fun out of the climax of the actual book. But okay, let's see if they are indeed a real prince, how could thou put Vashti to death? Xerxes says, it was not to gratify my own wish, but at the advice of the great princes of Persia and media. Okay, that sounds like Xerxes. Esther says, thy predecessors took no advice from ordinary intelligences. They were guided by prophetic counsel. Ariak brought Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon and Belchazar to summoned Daniel before him. And Xerxes says, they're left of those toothsome morsels. Are there still prophets abroad? Esther says, seek and thou wilt find. And then right after that, Mordecai, it says, is told prophetically by God that bigthana and Taresh are going to assassinate the king. And that gets communicated to the king. And then it turns out to be true, even though Mordecai apparently did not have any actual evidence of that. And then bigthana and Taresh try to kill themselves, but they get prevented. And instead they are quote nailed to the cross. All right, we got some more interesting legends here. But this one is particularly interesting to me because it casts Mordecai and Haman as, like these two guys who had to work together all the time. And they didn't like each other. And Haman eventually gets out promoted. And now is ahead of Mordecai. And Mordecai, of course, refuses to bow down. And he cites all of these ancient reasons for refusal that his ancestors had never bowed down to anybody from Haman's line. And they go into all of this stuff. And then there's a rebellion in India. And the king appoints Mordecai and Haman to command the armies to go and settle this thing down. And there's provisions made for three years. And it's kind of a goofus and gallant kind of situation. Haman burns through all of his provisions right away. But Mordecai is shrewd. And Haman tries to borrow from Mordecai and pay him interest. But Mordecai won't do it. And the whole thing ends up with Haman's men starving in the field and demanding that something happen or they're going to mutiny. So Haman comes back to Mordecai is like, I'll be your slave. Make me your slave. Just feed my troops so that I don't get killed. And so they write an agreement for Mordecai to become the master of Haman on Mordecai's kneecap. I mean, I don't know. That's just that's what I said. Their legends fan fiction. It's memeing. You get some really interesting stuff. But it takes us several layers deep into their age old fight. And it's a very different vision than what we get in the text with these guys being people working in the same environment, doing the same stuff, seeking the agenda of two different people groups and both seeking the pleasure and approval of the king so that they could advance their thing. But in all of it, this rivalry, which is almost like cousins or brothers of the way a lot of these legends are presenting it, in all of it, Mordecai looks pretty good, except maybe a little bit of pride. And Haman looks pretty inept and pretty bad. Okay, here's another one I thought was an interesting legend that departs from the original story. Haman gives a lengthy account of everything that's wrong with the Jews and his evidence to the king for why the Jews should be done away with. He lists what they do at all of their festivals and after he lists it all out, God is there. And he's like, yeah, that's pretty good. That's what we do. But you forgot Purim. You haven't heard of it yet, but it's going to commemorate your downfall. I guess just God was there in this particular legend. It's kind of fun. And then what we get is a king who's not passive like he is in the actual story. We get a king who doesn't like the Jews and he says so. I too desire the annihilation of the Jews said Xerxes, but I fear their God for he is mighty beyond compare. And he loves his people with a great love. Whoever rises up against them, he crushes under their feet. Just think of Pharaoh. And then he goes on and he's like, the ancestor, Amalek, oh, Haman attacked them and God didn't like that. And so it's really interesting that this legend is putting a lot of the subtext that the actual book just sort of lets you do that. If you know, you know, if you're reading this in the context of the larger Old Testament, you're going to catch it. But if you don't, I guess you didn't, it takes a lot of that and puts it right on the nose, giving those lines in a way that doesn't really make any sense to Haman and Xerxes. There's so much goofy, interesting, telling stuff in this book. But I think two episodes is enough looking through these legends. You get the idea real quick, a couple of the other highlights that I see here include one legend that says that when Esther grew up, Mordecai married her, and then Esther was never intimate with Xerxes. Instead, there was a, what was a quote, God sent down a female spirit that looked like Esther to be with the king. Okay, you know, we want to keep Esther's hands clean apparently in that particular legend. And then in addition to a bunch of prophecy from Mordecai and a really nice prayer from Esther, different versions of which appear in different legends and a certain version appear in the extended later Greek editions that are intermingled into the Orthodox and Catholic versions of the text. In addition to that, there's one more really juicy part to the whole thing where an angel is in the room, the angel Gabriel actually, when the actual confrontation happens at that banquet between Xerxes and Esther, while they're doing all of that, God has 10 angels dress up like the sons of Haman and go and cut down these royal trees that lined the walkway in the palace park. And so Xerxes is real mad about that. And he comes in from the balcony, having seen the trees being cut down by Haman's kids. And then the angel Gabriel himself in this myth, in this legend, in this meme, in this riff pushes Haman over on top of Esther. And that is enough. Now Xerxes has seen enough. The bag goes over Haman's head and everything unfolds the way you've heard. There is so much of this stuff. I'm not kidding. You could do a whole podcast just breaking down all of these legends and memes and riffs that go with it. Why did I want to talk about it with you? Well, a couple of reasons. One, they're just really interesting because they tell us something about where different people were at. Now, look, we're going through a period in time right now where there's a lot of effort to take existing heroes, existing properties and recast them in light of values that have become fashionable in just the last few years. That wave is already passing. Audiences have rejected that. But always, there is an effort to reimagine the heroes of the past whose very existence comes with a certain set of meanings, a certain notion of heroism and right and wrong and keep all of that brand equity. But just tell the story a little bit differently so that that character is now more palatable to contemporary sensibilities because they look pretty bad when we read the old stories about how people did things before. And there's a lot of hubris and there's a lot of chronological arrogance in that kind of move. But it's not a new problem, even though it is a big problem right now. It's a storytelling problem that has existed for a long time as people are constantly reimagining the great heroes of old. And so I think that tells us a story, the fact that there are so many legends that tells us that there's a lot of brand equity with Esther, that a lot of people, they might disagree on a lot of things, but everybody agrees. This lady casts a very long shadow. She paints a picture of what heroism looks like. She is the image of an ideal and this crosses historical cultural boundaries. And as a result, a lot of people have tried to lay claim to her reputation and to Mordecai's reputation, reframing it in different ways to satisfy their own agendas. Maybe some of those agendas are great. And my thinking would be that everybody knows in these stories that this is fan fiction. This is memeing the same way that if you get a meme with Tony Stark snapping with the infinity gauntlet and Thanos looking stunned and they're saying something other than what they said at that moment in the movie, like you all know, nobody's like, well, is that actually what they said though? I think that I mean, we should go back and look, I mean, maybe we should just accept that as reality. There's a picture with yellow words on it. No, I mean, everybody knows what the exercise is here. It's obviously memeing and fan fiction, but still the use of that image, the use of that part of the story tells you something about the gravity of Tony Stark and Thanos and that story and how long a shadow that whole saga in recent cinema casts. But for me, with all of these legends, I come back to this. The original version is an absolute thing of beauty. It is deft enough in its touch. It's light enough in its touch that it's timeless. And you can read all kinds of situations into it without polluting the actual story. The characters are ambiguous enough. The lack of any kind of moral proclamation about the violence and warring is open ended enough. But this is a book that raises questions. It makes you think about virtue. It makes you think about the role of the sovereign, of the divine, of what some might mistake for being fate, of the providence of God in everyday stuff and in the big pivotal moments in all of history. All of these legends, however, they narrow it down so much, they clutter it up so much that it looks more like a propaganda piece for one people at one time. And all of the legends that I read seem to strip it of a degree of its timelessness. Maybe also, I'm just so used to the original story that I'm super biased, but I think what I'm saying is fair. Literally and thematically and theologically, this book is so much stronger in its biblical form than it is in any of the later legends or even the later Greek edition forms because the original edition doesn't mention God. That is part of the thesis, the absence of God, the absence of miracles in an overt and observable way is so central to the point of God's providence, even when he's unseen, God's faithfulness, even when he's unseen. Look, imitation is the highest form of flattery. And the fact that people have riffed on this story means that, hey, me and all the riffers, we got something in common. We think this is a great amazing story that has a massively high profile and is massively influential. So high five over that riffers and memeers throughout the centuries of this story. That said, I'll take the original version. I think it does exactly what it was meant to do. And I think there's a reason that the version you and I looked at, the one that has been there since the start is the one that has stood the test of time. Finally, I am both saddened and honored to let you know right now that tomorrow will be our final episode on the Book of Esther. This book has been an absolute joy and I will miss it, but I'm glad we get one more day. All right, I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
