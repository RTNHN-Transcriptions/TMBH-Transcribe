This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we're in the middle of a two day conversation we're having here about this passage in Matthew chapter 19, where Jesus gives a very difficult teaching about divorce and remarriage. Starting in verse eight, it says Jesus replied, Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard, but it was not this way from the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness and Mary's another woman commits adultery. Very tough teaching, but there's some very serious context behind this that we need to explore in order to understand all of the nuances that go into this statement. So we're going to pick it up where we left off yesterday and roll from there. So Jesus says your hearts were hard and that's why Moses permitted a divorce. That's referenced in Deuteronomy 24, but then Jesus goes on to say, but it wasn't this way from the beginning, I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness and Mary's another woman commits adultery. Jesus is referencing back here to that stuff in Malachi. He's referencing a practice that had been going on since the Jews had returned from their exile in Persia under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah as a rubable. These characters that you hear have chronologically right at the end of the Old Testament, they get permission from Cyrus the Great, the Emperor dictator king of the Persians to go back and rebuild and even somewhat autonomously govern themselves under their own religious law. And so they go back and they do this and they make a new temple and they dedicate it, but kind of nothing happens. And it feels like God is distant and even in Malachi chapter two there, you could hear the disappointment that people were expressing it like, well, the temple used to work. We did sacrifices and it worked, but something's gone wrong. There's an estrangement. There's a distance that has occurred in this time. And part of that distance was a social hardening, some ick practices that started to develop that the prophets called out. And then that Jesus calls out, picking up where they left off here in the Book of Matthew. One of those practices that was an injustice and a moral outrage was this practice by which almost exclusively only men could divorce their wives. There was some percentage of the community that would view that with judgment, but a whole lot of the religious leaders would grant such a divorce absolutely readily. And so if a man got to a place where he's like, kind of like a younger model, this woman is already done for me. The things I wanted her to do for me, he could simply divorce her and move on to something he thought was better, which was not quite a death sentence for that woman, but it was an unbelievable injustice to that woman to say, well, technically I did do pay a lot of paperwork and there is kind of a vague allowance for me divorcing you in Deuteronomy 24. And she is hotter than you. Like if you were in my position, I think you'd do the same thing. So out with you, take your stuff. It's oppression. It's injustice. It's vile. It's evil. These men were making life promises. They were attaching themselves at the level of the soul to their wives. They were making life together, not just for the two of them, but making humans who according to Malachi, God intended to be raised up in keeping with the values of the kingdom and the values of who God is. And they weren't doing it. And these divorces were destroying women. They were destroying children. It was a generational crime against your own offspring and their offspring after that. It was a crisis. It wasn't just some puritanical nitpicking that was happening at this point. It was a massive problem. But the men who did it were technically correct. And the religious leaders who aided and abetted this horrible behavior were also technically correct because they just wrote some new laws and created some new paperwork and for obviously a clerical fee that will go to the religious leaders doing the paperwork and to the maintenance of the temple. We can draft up that paperwork and we assure you it's completely binding and absolutely legal. As we have discussed, oftentimes in these conversations and as you have no doubt observed as someone who's paid attention to history, something being legal and something being moral are not the same thing. And one of the great weaknesses of modern thought, especially in the last hundred or so years is to conflate those things and imagine that they are the same. Because something becomes moral, the second nine people in judge costumes declare something to be one way or the other, or that something becomes moral. The second 500 people who can't agree on anything in this country get together and make a backroom deal that stuffs money into their own pockets and the pockets of their most wealthy and influential constituents. Somehow that process produces morality that somehow an immoral process makes things moral. Come on, every single one of us can think of numerous exceptions, numerous examples of things that were illegal. You better not do that when the right thing to do was the illegal thing or things that were absolutely legal, but it was absolutely wrong to obey that law. Well, it doesn't matter if some people come up with a system and buy some paper and some ink and some pens and write some stuff down and are like, Oh, this is how divorce is now. Does that make that woman any less violated? Does that make this suddenly more just because there was paperwork and then other people in another related office wearing slightly different outfits were also like, Oh, no, I think that divorce practices did definitely passes muster for our constitutional legal evaluation. No, it's still immoral. It's still cruel to these women and to these mothers, especially considering there is no safety net in this society. Your family is your safety net is effectively not just the man kicking a woman to the curb for a younger model. It is a man saying to someone, I don't care how you die and I don't care how the rest of your life goes, go forth and suffer. I have used you up and I'm done with you. And so we might be tempted to look at a passage like Malachi to or the different parts of the Bible that deal with divorce and be like, man, God just didn't understand how marriages or the realities of what people go through, but I would say that read is incorrect. He did understand. That's why there was a concession that he made to allow divorce or to create at least some sort of mechanism for this because of human brokenness and the hardness of our hearts. But further, at least for the last several decades, we tend to be very troubled when we come to passages where it feels like God is getting involved specifically in our sex business. And cultural resistance, cultural raising of the hackles toward the parts of the Bible that deal with sex and sexuality and marriage and things like that. And maybe part of its understandable because of some of the weird ways that stuff was handled over the last several decades in terms of how the church communicated with people and how the church communicated with the world and how the church understood sex and sexuality. Like I get that the conversation is complicated, but when we just look at the text at God's motivation and why he has these demands about marriage and divorce and how it works, it actually passes muster even with our new modern morality matrix of almost everything being shoved into the oppressor and the oppressed formula of moral decision making. Here the oppressor is the man who divorces a woman who's in a position of weakness and dependence. And the oppressor is the system, the institution that enables it and makes it go. The oppressed is a woman who has literally no recourse whatsoever other than to turn to some very ugly lines of work that are far beneath her station. This is a mom who would be forced to turn to these lines of work. This is somebody who had promises, who had vows. So I think God looks pretty dang good in these passages for being the defender of justice and the one who cares about the oppressed when other people didn't including the leaders of the religion that was supposedly dedicated to him. And so what Jesus says in verse nine, again, that goes like this, I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery, if we read that completely divorced from historical context, we could look at that and be like, man, the Bible is narrow and bigoted and Jesus is narrow and bigoted and unforgiving and not understanding of men and women and what they've gone through. But when we understand the cultural practice of cheap, lazy divorce, which is effectively high brow, fancy adultery anyway, and the negative effect, not just on the heart of the woman, but on the prospects for life for that woman and the kids who came out of that family, Jesus teachings look not only not oppressive and not understanding. They look profoundly justice oriented and profoundly understanding to someone who at this time, nobody in culture apparently gave a rip about. You know, what we have here is another master stroke from Jesus where people come to him and they're like, I think I could probably out Bible Jesus of Nazareth. And then he utterly shames them by pointing out the gross hypocrisy of their own practices and things that everybody considers to be completely moral and completely normative. Billion dollar question then, well, what about divorce and remarriage? Well, if we take this contextually, we understand that Jesus is being presented with two options. One is, yeah, you can get divorced for literally anything you want. Just fill out the paperwork and pay the proper clerical fee. And they just make sure it gets delivered to the woman properly and you can throw a crap out on the front yard. You never have to look at her or talk to her again. That's option number one. Option number two is the only out that we can find in the text is some sort of marital unfaithfulness and Jesus picks the much more narrow one. So in light of that and in light of the original cultural context, it appeared that the type of divorce Jesus is condemning is this kind of sham divorce. And also Jesus is clearly cutting to the heart of the motives of the people involved and saying that this technically correct divorce that you men just keep buying and paying for a church, that they're nothing but high class adultery. And whatever they do in these circumstances with their second marriage should be regarded as such. How does that apply to what you do today? If you're divorced and you decide to remarry, I am not your judge. What I would like to add to the conversation is that there clearly was a cultural contextual component to this teaching. Bottom line, Jesus indicates that people were made to fit together in love and in marriage and intimacy and that marriage is a very special institution where two individuals become one thing. The offspring of these unions was supposed to be something special and unique and God says that he hates divorce. Ultimately, I am some clown on the internet who tries to think about the Bible and make sense of it and talk about it in a way that might be fun or interesting with you. And I am not your judge when it comes to divorce, remarriage, what you've been through, what you do with a passage like this. What you're going to get from me on this is grace and understanding from one person who screwed things up and been hurt by other people's decisions to another person who no doubt has screwed things up and has been hurt by other people's decisions. Grace and the peace of God to all of us on these difficult things. Thanks for kicking around this passage with me. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
