J.R.R.R. Tolkien, he was a Christian fellow and he lived in England a long time ago, 100 years. And he had an idea to write stories about a made up place with made up races of creatures and whatnot. It was really, really good. There was a whole movie and everything about it that came out here a few years ago. A lot of people really liked it. And in that movie and in that book, there's a character in the middle whose name is Wormtung. It's actually his name. And his job is advisor to the king, King Theoden, the king of Rohan. And what happens is that you meet this guy Wormtung and you realize right off the bat is the viewer or the reader that that dude is, he's bad. You just, you know it. And Rohan, he completely makes, I mean, he makes no effort whatsoever. This guy's the guy's name is Wormtung for crying out loud. You can tell he's horrible. Now, of course, immediately you wondered yourself now the king of Rohan came to accept the council of the man whose last name is Wormtung. You would think that when a guy like that shows up and says, hello, I was inquiring about the chief advisor position that you advertised in the thrifty nickel. I brought my resume and the king's like, well, let's just take a look at that. Right now, I am here. Okay. I am an impressive experience. I noticed your name is Wormtung. Now, this is a job that involves a lot of talking, something that heavily involves the tongue. The thumbs are generally associated with things that are dirty and slimy. You know, I hate to judge a book by its cover, but there's just so much at stake what with me being king of the whole kingdom and having all these subjects. I just, I would just be sick to my stomach if I didn't trust my gut here and then pass on this particular resume because of how your last name is exactly a metaphor for exactly the kind of person who would be exactly wrong for this job. Thank you so much. I mean, we'll keep your application on file. If anything changes, we'll let you know. That's what he should have done, but he didn't do that. Instead, he receives him as his advisor and row hand is in a really important position in the unfolding of all this big story that's being told. And the good guys show up to the court of good king Theoden and they're like, we're going to need your help. But something's wrong and you can tell right away that Theoden isn't making any sense. And there's this guy whispering in his ears, weasel this worm tongue type. And once again, token has totally made it clear to you as the reader or the viewer, he's very bad, but the people there can't totally see it. There's a bunch of people in the room, most notably the king, the guy whose will is law. He's the one who needs to see through it, but he just can't see through it. Now straight up, worm tongue, I think is it may be directly derived from or inspired by Haman from the book of Esther. If he's not, it is quite the fancy accident for somebody who was into the Bible as much as Jared or token, the author of that story was, but it is such a gratifying moment as you're going through that story. And finally, the king comes do his senses. Suddenly things change and everybody sees this dude for what he is because you could tell from the beginning that he was horrible. And now everybody sees it. And I like those kind of moments in books and stories because there's something very cathartic about that thing where you're like, whoa, whoa, how can people not see what's going on even in real life? You know, where you get a situation at work or maybe it's a politician or something. Everybody's just gaga over this lady, gaga over this guy. And you're going, I'm telling you, they are bad. And putting this person in positions of influence is bad. And then when that finally comes to light, you're like, see, okay, good. Finally justice is done. It's really embarrassing when you're wrong. You totally misevaluate somebody. But just forget about that part or possibility and just don't think about that at all. In Esther chapter seven, we get that payoff. Finally, the one character we need to open his eyes and see who this idiot is who is dumping, corrupting poison into his ear. We need the king to come to his senses and understand who that guy is and be done with him once and for all because we can't really get to justice and rightness and resolution to this story until the king sees who this guy is. And finally in Esther chapter seven, the king sees who this guy is. Esther at her second banquet with King Xerxes and the enemy of the Jews, Heyman, who's trying to kill all the Jews, kill Mordecai, kill everybody. She says to the king, I'd like it if you would spare my life, me and my people for we are sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation. If we were just getting sold like to be slaves or something like that, I wouldn't even bother you because you have a ton of things going on right now. And the king is like, well, I don't think we were going to kill you. Well, who is he? Where's the man who dared to do such a things? Herxies asks and Esther says, the adversary and enemy is the vile Heyman. She implicates him. I've even seen some really cool classical art where she dramatically points toward Heyman or posture is amazing. And the point of her finger is absolutely damning. And it really does. If you saw the Peter Jackson version of the Lord of the Rings, the moment where Wormtongue is finally confronted and outed is very dramatic as well. We get this and Heyman is terrified and the king is furious, maybe a little bit embarrassed because his signet ring got used to do this. So the king goes outside in an angry huff to do whatever it is that he does out there. But Heyman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. Now, look, I don't know how you beg other people's wives for your life. I have never had to do that before, but I'm running the scenario in my brain right now. I'm trying to think how would it be most effective for me to get a former friend to not kill me by persuading his wife that she should go to bat for me. And let me tell you what never comes into my mind in any way when I picture that scenario. It's like falling on top of her on a couch. Never. That's not any of them. I don't think that's the right posture to assume before the queen. Because of that, things are going to get even worse. Look at what he does. Then Heyman was terrified before the king and the queen. The king got up in a rage and went outside. But Heyman realizing that the king had already decided his fate stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Heyman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, Willie, even molest the queen while she's with me in the house. Now you could read this language as Heyman is just innocently falling like right next to Esther who would be reclining on the couch. And by the way, you kind of got a picture of how they ate in ancient times. Even if you go to parts of the Middle East now and you kind of recline while you eat that sort of blew my mind the first time that happened, I went to a restaurant with this kind of seating. Then it's like we all get this little kind of half bed, half couch thing. And we get like figs and these different kinds of breads and stuff. And I realize we're supposed to be here for a very long time is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. So reclining would be a normal thing to do at the table in the ancient world and the Persian world. And maybe we could read the language here of the authors being that Heyman just ran over there and like climbed on the same couch as Queen Esther. That's pretty weird. Pretty pretty presumptuous. Maybe we could read the languages having him be so out of sorts and so frazzled that he was even not conscious enough of his body language and asserted himself in a way that would be much more suggestive. Either way, this is the dude's mistake. He demonstrates that he does not understand the king he serves. He doesn't know other guys wired. He doesn't know how the dude ticks. Why did he go outside? One good possibility is to figure out how he was going to get out of this because he's frustrated at the situation. And what do we know about King Xerxes from outside the Bible from this book here? That's Herodotus. What do we know from inside the Bible? That's this book here. We know that Xerxes doesn't like looking stupid. We know that he's very influenceable, that he gets himself into trouble a lot and that then he tries to think of ways to save face. The shrewd person who understands who they're dealing with will give him an out. The stupid person will give him an excuse to implicate them and make them the bad guy. Heyman doesn't understand how Xerxes is wired. All Xerxes is looking for is an excuse and Heyman gives it to him with his sloppy inappropriate desperate conduct. It's very subtle. So what we are really seeing here with this high point moment where the stakes of everything are coming right down to the wire is that it's a contest to see who can manipulate the king better. It's a contest to see who is more shrewd. And in the end, Heyman proved to be stupid and frazzling and flusterable and therefore capable of making the worst decisions at the worst times. But Esther as Eisner veins, she handled her business. She knew that when you get the answer, you want you hang up the phone. She doesn't say a lot of words. She only says what she needs to say. She doesn't answer any of the begging. She just lays there on her couch and lets the thing play out. Indeed, this all came down to a competition to who knew the king better, who had been more attentive, who knew his insecurities and who knew how to prop him up and give him off ramps to get out of the difficult situations he made for himself. Guess what? Those talents that we saw Esther put on display clear back here when she was winning that questionable contest to become queen and winning over the whole harem and winning over all of the attendance and all of the Unix so that she was the sweetheart of the competition and the palace. That same skill set that she had when she was a young lady. She just figured out how to weaponize that for the sake of all of her people. And Haman is simply completely outclassed by her at this game. And again, because of that, we get the worm tongue moment payoff here. Finally, the king sees who he's been dealing with. The scales fall off of his eyes. He can tell that Haman is the problem with the whole thing. Esther of course teed it up perfectly so that he would see it. And now the only question remaining is what's going to happen to Haman? Probably next time around would be a good time to talk about that. I met this at 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
