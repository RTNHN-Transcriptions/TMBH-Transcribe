We're doing something weird this week. We're working on a challenging high stakes for you and me passage in Galatians 5. Specifically, it's Galatians 5, 16, which says, So I say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. Other translations say the indulged the flesh. And I got my buddy Jeff here working it through with me all week. So we're just going to pick up where we left off yesterday. So the NIV says, so I say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature or the old NIV does. We're going to look and see what the new NIV says here in a little bit. The English standard version says, but I say walk by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. I think I know what sinful nature means when I hear that phrase, I think, Oh, well, my impulse to do naughty things. I've had that my whole life as long as I can remember being a person. I have wanted to do things that would be mean to other people, selfish, destructive, sometimes just stupid for no reason. I don't even know why, but I just want to, but it's not a good idea. And I know I probably shouldn't. That's what I think of when I hear sinful nature. When I hear the desires of the flesh, it sounds like sex stuff. Sure. Am I wrong? It has flesh in there and we were using the word flesh for like penis stuff already all around Galatians. I mean, maybe that's why the NIV 1984 translators avoided that word because they felt like it would connect things back to sex stuff and circumcision stuff too much. But what does it mean? What do you think flesh means here? I don't think you're way off here because in verses 19 and 20 coming up, he's going to bring up impurity to botch. Yeah, there is sex stuff. And sex stuff. Yeah. So yeah, there's a lot of sex stuff. It makes sense to connect the two. The problem is, and I know we normally don't do original languages here on the podcast, but no, it's fine. We're doing weird stuff. Like these couple of days here with you, you can do whatever. The word sinful is not in that Greek phrase, in Greek. And neither is the word nature. No. It literally means strong desires of sarcos, sarks, the flesh. And different Bible authors use that. Sarks word differently. John uses it a lot to say body, human body, like flesh means flesh and bone, blood and sin. Yeah, like first, John, two, this stuff about all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh and the desires of the pride of the eyes of life and the pride of life. Right. He's using the Greek word you have in mind. Right. But Paul almost always uses it in contrast with spirit. As if there is something about his concept of the flesh that ties into a spiritual reality. It's not just the human body. It has something to do with our humanness in trying to solve our problems, as opposed to the life of God to solve our problems, specifically the spirit. So the flesh is inherently bad or the flesh is inherently neutral. The flesh is inherently not the spirit. So I think when Paul uses it, the outcomes of the flesh are bad, but not that it in and of itself is necessarily bad. Jeff, how is this different than the wolves, man? It sounded impatient. I'm not impatient with you as a human. I'm letting too much of how we talk when there aren't microphones on leak through into this. But whatever, that still sounds like wolves to me. Like it's just a different way of framing up the wolf. It's a flesh wolf instead of a sinful nature wolf. How is that different? Because now we do have a choice. Sinful nature implies we don't have a choice. There's still some remnant or drags of some fallenness that is still in Christians. I mean, Paul's writing this to Christians when he says all these things. So if he's saying you're still carrying around something that has not yet been fixed by the righteousness of God given to you as a gift by faith, then so much of the rest of the New Testament doesn't make any sense. He's talking to Christians who have a new nature, but he is saying you still have a proclivity to try to do this by yourself. Even though you now have the spirit, you actually now have a choice you didn't have before. You can choose to obey now. You can choose to live by the spirit. You can choose to abide in Christ in ways you couldn't before because you were dead to God. But now count yourself dead to sin. It's like it's not that there's two wolves at war. One wolf is dead and it's a corpse there on the floor because it was crucified with Christ. And so Paul talks a lot about taking off and putting on take off the old and put on the new. So it's like to choose the flesh option is like to choose to put on that dead corpse of a skin on as an overcoat. It's not fitting. It doesn't work like that anymore. Why would you want to do that instead? Put on the things of the spirit that you are now live to in ways you weren't before because of the work of Christ, the new Adam who by his righteousness, many will be counted righteous as opposed to the old Adam by who sin all are called sinful. The life of Christ is now available to the Galatians and to all who are saved by faith so that you don't have to disobey anymore. And so it's not this fight between natures. It's do you realize what what you have Galatians? Why are you running back to performative? I did the thing. I'm in the club when you have the spirit. That's like picking that corpse up and wearing it like a coat again. And if you started this process by faith, why do you think you should continue it by human effort by works, by the law, by the flesh? And I think that's what he's talking about pursuing the flesh is all it's going to do is lead to more of the destruction and you don't have to do that anymore. So here we go. Romans 5, 18, consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people. So also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. For justice through the disobedience of the one man, many were made sinners. So also through the obedience of the one man, many will be made righteous. So again, it has to do with this righteousness idea that the righteousness that we could never measure up that the law shows we could never measure up to is now replaced by the law of the spirit and the righteousness that's a gift from God. So why would anyone want to choose to go back to the law? That's Paul's argument again and again and again. And I think in Galatians 5, he's saying that that wanting to go back to the law, wanting to go back to human effort to become righteous instead of the very life of Christ, which is now given to you by the Holy Spirit who makes you righteous, they are at odds. They will never agree trying to say, I'm going to be sanctified by my behavior instead of by the spirit's life in me. Yes. That's what's at odds in Galatia, I think. Yeah. And I think we're a hundred and ninety three episodes into absolutely clown hammering that point. Clown hammer clearly gets in your head, man. I will never hear that song the same way. Clearly, that is the point and I'm not having any trouble with the theological point of Galatians. Well, that's not true. I've admitted freely that I've had a little bit of trouble with it here and there. I mean, we've had to work to get through some of this and I've pointed out several times that if it's hard, you're in good company because Peter in his letter says that it's hard. Some of the stuff Paul says is both A scripture and B hard. So it's okay. I think this is, for me, this is the second most difficult book in the New Testament and the most difficult, of course, is Jude. Come on, stop. Do you really mean that? No, it's just first one that popped into my head. Revelation? No, I would say Hebrews. Oh, Hebrews. I just think Hebrews is such a fire hose. There's so much happening so fast and it's all gettable. Yeah, it's just, oh, my goodness, you said like eight words and now I have to spend an hour in the Old Testament. There's eight more words. Now I have to go read the entire penituke again. It's just a, it's just a lot. I think Galatians is very difficult. Romans is kind of the pinch zoomed out version, but all of that to say, the conflict is really clear in Galatians. There is no life by human effort. God is the giver of life, faith in Christ. That's how right standing with God occurs. The rub here at the end that the eager listeners, receivers of this letter are sitting there all gathered together in church, hearing your red. They're all eagerly wanting to hear, okay, so what do I do? Okay, you are at fair enough, Paul. Yep, we got it wrong. We listened to some gossip. We did some stupid crap around here. We shouldn't have done that. Yep, you're right. Peter did come around. We shouldn't have cited that. That's bad. You're right. We shouldn't have fallen for it. You're right. We shouldn't have made factions. We shouldn't have fought for each other. You're right. That Sarah and Hagar, the free woman, the slave woman, I see it all. Of course, circumcision isn't going to get it done. You're right. But I think the thing they're all sitting here wondering now is, okay, so what do I do? Oh, man, is that a cliffhanger or what? This is future, Jeff, saying thanks for indulging Matt and I in this conversation this week. You'll have to come back tomorrow to find out if my answer is satisfactory or helpful in any way. I think the solid money is done. No. This has been the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
