What is the first moral lesson you remember being taught? Dig all the way back into the memory banks here. Give you a second to think about it. Okay, I came up with three that I think probably most of us learned right off the bat. Here they are in no particular order. Don't lie, don't hit, don't take other people's stuff. What do you think of that? Was that any of your lists? I think the reason that those three appear on most people's lists is because they show a basic respect for self and others, right? You don't hit and you don't take people's stuff because hitting someone is an attack on their person and that is fundamentally wrong if you don't want people hitting you, don't hit other people. Dancing with people's stuff says that you get things that they have ownership of. We believe ownership to be an actual thing. Property is a thing. It is maybe not for a little little kid, but you practice as a kid, but property is a way of commodifying what is left of your past self money. Yeah, it's just a sheet of paper, but it's like, this is what I traded my life essence before now for money or stuff. Remember, you're not supposed to mess with that stuff and other people. And then the don't lie thing just means you live square with reality and you might be wrong being wrong is allowed, but you don't want to misrepresent things and be intentionally wrong. That means that you're abusing or manipulating other people or that you're trying to live out of sync with how the things actually are. And then the fourth one I think flows out of those and maybe this wasn't your fourth, but for me it was and that's include everybody. Don't leave other people out. Make sure everybody knows that they're valuable and that they're important. And it is amazing how these very basic moral lessons that we almost roll our eyes at because we've heard them so many times are actually the subject of a whole lot of the things that we feel friction with each other about because sometimes we don't do these things. And then we disagree about who didn't do those things the most or when or where. And it really does explain a lot of the drama of humanity and politics and fighting throughout the years. But I want to focus on that last one, the childhood lesson about including everybody because it looks like Jesus himself, the author of morality, if the Bible is to be believed is disregarding that rule right here as we get into Matthew chapter 10. We'll look at exactly how in just a second here's a quick reset. We've gone all the way through the first nine chapters of the book Matthew and we got is Jesus who seems really cool, really interesting and compelling to people. He says very interesting things, he says things that characterize him as a king of this great kingdom that you can't really see yet. But the values of the kingdom are present and the kingdom is becoming more present and you can be a part of the kingdom if you want to and you should be a part of the kingdom. And the kingdom is the fulfillment of all the religious stuff you've been doing around here in the past. He says that to the people of Israel and then he demonstrates tremendous authority over all these different things and nobody has authority over and everybody's very, very intrigued. And then at the end of chapter nine, as we get into chapter 10, he connects with his disciples his inner circle, the 12 disciples. He's like, hey, we are about to take this thing from something that is very, very local to the next stage toward this thing becoming much, much, much bigger. And what he's about to lay out in chapter 10 to his 12 apostles as he sends them out to go and take the first steps in the kingdom thing going bigger is he lays out a local plan. Here's how we're going to go and talk with people in our neck of the woods. But here eventually is what you're going to do to take this thing beyond our boundaries to take this from a local regional thing to a super regional thing and eventually to a global thing because it's not a kingdom. It's the kingdom and it's supposed to go everywhere. So what you would expect is we get into this second great big speech of the gospel of Matthew. Some people call this the missional discourse and follow up to the first great big speech, which is the Sermon on the Mount, of course, you'd expect for Jesus to be like, hey, remember this thing from the time of Abraham was meant for everyone. We're going to expand our circle right now as big as we possibly can. So I want you 12 to go to the ends of the earth and start telling people about this stuff. Oh, question. What about like language and everything? Don't worry about it. I have things I can do to get around the language barrier. We just need you to go big right now. He doesn't do that. Instead, he uses language that seems to contradict the basic morality that we got taught as kids and that the trajectory of the Bible is pointing toward and that Jesus has already affirmed in Matthew about including people picking it up in Matthew 10 verse 5. It says, these 12 Jesus sent out with the following instructions. We listed the 12 last time around. Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. Wait, what? I mean, it's such a disappointment right off the bat. Again, especially because it seems like Matthew and Jesus and Jesus life and God are all about people beyond even just the Jewish people. I mean, you got this business about the king of the Jews getting it wrong. Herod, but the outsiders from the East, the wise men, they get it right and I flip over here a second. It was noisy for a minute. Three chapter four versus 14 through 16. And this is where you get all of the language about how Jesus is fulfilling prophecy and the people have seen a great light and that all of this stuff is happening in Galilee, even Galilee of the Gentiles and so, okay, this is all warming up and ramping up toward something that goes way beyond the boundaries of Israel. And then verse 25 of Matthew four, literally before the Sermon on the Mount gets started as large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him. And so it's a mixed group of people. Jesus takes those people up on the hill and talks to them about the kingdom. He seems to be inviting them to the kingdom. Why then would he do this exclusive cool kid table when I was just giving him credit for being the cool kid in eighth grade that invited everybody to the table? Well, you're smart. And you can tell that I'm setting up a little bit of false tension here. But the reality that we're getting is that there is a thing that is unfolding, not a thing that is happening in one phase, much like a local restaurant that grows up to have three or four locations in the same town that then becomes regional, then super regional, the national, then maybe even global. This is following the same trajectory right now. Like we talked about yesterday, no one is thinking in terms of a multi ethnic religion. Nobody on earth. Nobody is thinking in terms of worshiping some other group of people's God. That's crazy. I can't even fathom rooting for the Kansas City chiefs, no matter how good they might be because that's Kansas City's team. And I'm from Colorado. I refer Denver, whether they're terrible or not. If you can understand that and then multiply by like a thousand, you can understand how just utterly foreign the concept would be of having a global religion or worshiping somebody else's God. It seems that Jesus and the Bible are making it very clear that the trajectory toward including everyone is happening, but right now only one guy is bought in and it's Jesus. Nobody else is on board with this plan yet. And right now, there's still something that needs to be settled with Israel. So here's what it looks like the game plan is go and talk to the people of Israel who should see this coming seriously. Make a mental note of this. You're going to see this theme a lot over the next, especially 10 chapters that Jesus seems to hold a high expectation on his own country, men, his own ethnic brothers and sisters that they should have the knowledge and the history and the prophecy and the awareness to be like, whoa, two plus two is four. Jesus is the Messiah. How do we get on board? What can we do? And if that were to be the case, then he would have all of Israel to mobilize not to go and defeat the Romans, but to go and represent him as the Messiah. Now what I just said is very off putting for a modern Jewish person because they don't regard Jesus still as the Messiah. And it's amazing how comfortable in their own skin and cool with talking about things like this very candidly with our varying perspectives. Every single Jewish friend I have is. So I don't feel like I need to tip toe a whole bunch. I know what my Jewish friends think. They know what I think we get along just fine and it's cool. But to be fair to the text, it is saying Jesus felt it was reasonable to expect the Jewish people to recognize him as their king and to rally behind him and for them to be the ones that would take this out. It is also very evident from the stuff he's going to say over the next few chapters, especially in the kingdom parable chapter of Matthew 13 that he knew that ultimately that would not be the case en masse and that he would be moving forward with a rather small group of people. Maybe there's even a degree of symbolism in choosing 12 disciples. And the 12 tribes of Israel is a pretty pronounced thing throughout the Old Testament. And there is great intentionality here in Matthew saying in verse five, once again, these 12 Jesus sent out with the following instructions. Is it like a fulfillment of prophecy or a secret Bible code? Maybe, maybe more so. It's just a parallel. Well, this language in here that indicates that Matthew understands Jesus to be a new Moses, a new and greater Moses, a new and greater even Abraham in the sense that he is building a new family of faith, not rooted in ethnicity, but rooted in belief, rooted in assuming the right posture before the king. And even John the Baptist is hitting that theme when he interacts with the Pharisees, Sadducees or whatever in chapter three with all of that language about, you know, the acts is already at the root of the tree. God can raise up children from these stones and all of that business. So the short term plan would seem to be that right now the disciples are getting sent out on a unique job that is not the job of you or me or anybody who read this after the fact after Jesus was crucified and resurrected. Rather, their job right now is go get their feet wet, go talk to a bunch of people, see how many of their neighbors and initial contacts might recognize who Jesus is and come to the conclusion that maybe he is the Messiah and jump in. Ultimately, this is going to go to the larger audience. And how do I know that? Because like 10 versus later Jesus starts talking about that as well. But if we want to interpret Matthew and Jesus actions throughout the rest of Matthew, well, we got a linger on those two verses and pay real close attention to the fact that Jesus seems to view his immediate mission in terms of preaching and teaching and miracles and stuff like that to be reaching the quote lost sheep of Israel. Like I wrote down verses and stuff that we were going to look at about the lost sheep thing, maybe we'll do a clean up day tomorrow where we hit that and a couple other questions we haven't touched on yet. He's going to preach to the lost sheep of Israel. He's going to articulate how he is the fulfillment of everything predicted in the Old Testament. The Old Testament broke out the bat, bat, bat, bat, Jesus breaks out the bat, bat, bat, see guys, it's me. Ultimately, we know how this ends. He ends up getting executed by the majority who ultimately reject him as their king and Messiah. In the short term, we're going to go talk to our blood relatives, the people of Israel, but this should not be viewed as eternal exclusivism, rather just a brief moment rooted in respect and rightness to go to the people who've been part of this story, part of this party all along and see if they want to stay in with where it's going next before they go in and invite everybody else to the table and to participate in this. And if that only halfway makes sense to you, it's because we're only halfway done talking about it. So we will pick it up there. We'll be back in the next couple of verses and flesh out this idea a little bit more tomorrow. In the meantime, I think we should not hurt people or hit people or take their stuff. And I think we should include everybody and be nice and I think we should not lie. It really wasn't the point of the whole episode, but it just seemed like one of those things that I can always use to be reminded of. I'm Matt, this is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
