This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Forgive me. You're still getting sick voice Someday I'm gonna get better and it's gonna be great what I do But in the meantime here's a two part episode This is the second part of a double episode where we're working through an evaluation of the Xerxes and era and We're setting up to think about what stuff from that era or how stuff from that era would have informed how the original audience Thought about things in the next era the art is Xerxes and era that comes into focus as we look at the books of Ezra and Nehemiah Coming up next so much fun and even if history is not your favorite thing in the world I just love that you let me do this from time to time because I think it's awesome And I think it's super fascinating and I think it helps me understand the Bible better All right, man my friend Jeffrey play some cool music and then we're gonna pick it back up where we left off Another aspect of the Xerxes and era that I think people would have looked back on and remembered with clarity would have been the building aspect of his reign He seemed to want to expand on the stuff that his dad had built and so he Built up Perceptible us he made improvements SUSA There are engravings to that effect that you can still see in both places or maybe they've been moved But they were in both of those places. There's art all around Persepolis depicting people coming to this great throne room to Get an audience with the king and they're all clothed in different attire from all around the world Which I think would have been another thing that people would have recalled from this era Just how cosmopolitan it was and how proud Xerxes was to be a global emperor of all of these people like his children That he was gathering under his wings But he liked to build and clearly he got that impulse from his dad who did Super grandiose things and it looked like Xerxes retirement plan Would have been to spend more time at Persepolis given the amount of investment that he made a little ways down the road in This other capital and this other palace complex It looks like it only made it as far as being a palace with sort of a tent city during the time of his reign But I think it's fairly likely that he would have spent a lot of time out east in Persepolis not that far He's just down the road once again And that's kind of interesting to me because whenever I archaeologically think about Esther I picture her roaming the halls of susa of course goes for the whole story is set So I see any of the ruins from susa and I look at the artwork and the style Which would have been a little different from the artwork and the style of his predecessor or his successor the art and all that stuff That would have been part of the feel of the Xerxes and era as well But when I picture susa picture Esther roaming around there and mortik i being there But also it seemed like you really liked Esther and that makes me think that Esther would have traveled with him to some extent And my guess would be that she roamed the halls of Persepolis as well And if he really did find her to be the most pleasing most agreeable of his wives I think it's reasonable to imagine that that Persepolis building project that happened after he was married to Esther Might have included a bunch of stylistic touches and flourishes and input a cootraments even that were provided by or inspired by the keen eye the tasteful eye of queen Esther It's kind of fun to think about whether she had to say and how that place turned out or not Surely one of the things still that people would have remembered when they thought back to the Xerxes and era Would have been how things were starting to move toward a more impressive Persepolis and how the Eyes of the king were starting to drift in that direction imagining a new center of power And I think we think in our history the same way We have certain points of geography that we kind of romanticize As being heavily associated with one particular era or another And I think it's fascinating that it looks like the Xerxes and era was defined by An initial push far far west to go fight greece And then a later gentle withdrawal a bit further east toward Persepolis And I think another thing that would have been very defining of the Xerxes and era Would have been this internal conflict he had between Really advancing the whole a Huramazda is the one true god thing And also being religiously tolerant. Why do we see him so torn on that? Well, as his reign goes on it looks like he's more proud to announce like I Destroyed this sanctuary of demons That's an inscription that I think can be found in Persepolis Where he boasts that some people were worshiping the wrong gods the wrong way and he destroyed it So we see that he wants to crush some other religions that he views as being problematic But maybe that impulse was tempered a little bit by the lady with whom he shared a bed Seems like he had a soft spot for Esther seems like he had a soft spot for the jews Seems like all of these early achaemenid kings including arta xerxes xerxes successor had a soft spot for the jews So I suspect that one of the ways that people after xerxes died would have remembered the xerxes and era Would have been that he tried to do religious tolerance and at times did But you could always sense that that was pretty tenuous and you could always sense By his policies and demeanor how he actually wanted things to be a final way that I think people would have looked back on the xerxes and era Is that they would have remembered the court intrigue that things really did get out of control with the eunuchs That the further into his reign he got the more they really were making decisions That his first wife a mestris. I think that was his first wife right his most famous wife for sure was unpredictable erratic out of control Violent and plotting maybe part of the reason we perceive Esther being so popular around the palace and the royal court Is because she had more of a deft touch Socially than a mestris. Maybe it didn't take a very deft touch at all To outclass and out refine a lady who had a whole bunch of the body parts cut off one of her perceived rivals But ultimately that relational chaos is what would do in xerxes eight years And a couple of months after the closing events of the climactic events of the book of Esther We see a situation where there's some sort of grab for power. The original sources don't totally agree Some sources try to pin some of this on art of xerxes other sources say he was a horrified bystander But they all seem to agree that there was a guy named art of banos I mean you've heard that name come up before it's a very popular name There have been multiple art of banices that we've run into is no doubt a royal family name probably one Descended in some way from those seven conspirators who worked with darius And art of banos along with megabytes Decided I never know if i'm saying that name right did you notice I just kind of rushed past it to make it go away M-e-g-a b y z o s z u s Now I don't even remember how to spell it but it's something like that you can see why somebody would mumble through that one megabytes This megabytes that sounds too much like jesus. I don't like that megabytes. I'm going with that These two guys along with some unix conspired to work things out to get the king alone in his bed chamber And it looks like xerxes this great powerful man Who even went and led armies out into battle that he died in his bed And then there was a brief Squabble of succession right after that with art as xerxes killing the conspirators And assuming for years and years and years to come the throne for himself Was xerxes a good king who would be missed or a disaster of a king I don't think either those probably sums it up right. I think he was probably a much more competent king Then he gets credit for he lost a bad battle that he might have won if he'd fought when he was a little bit older And a little bit more Refined and humbled and sharper in his judgment He seemed to have a little bit of trouble with the ladies and it seemed to be Insecure to the extent that it negatively affected the empire at times As other people could step in and manipulate him for certain outcomes It looks like the final few years of his reign went better at least for the jewish people With mortikai overseeing things and lending a steadying hand To how all of this played out what happened to ester and mortikai after the death of xerxes I have no idea But there are some very interesting legends that have emerged over the centuries about these two characters And I thought it might be fun to look at a couple of those next time around and with that We say goodbye to the xerxes and the era of purgia for the time being I'm matt this is the ten minute bible hour podcast.
