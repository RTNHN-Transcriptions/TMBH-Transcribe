This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we are just about to the last chapter in the book of Matthew. We've put in so much time and so much work to dive deeply into this book to try to understand it the way the original audience would have understood it to spread all the parts out in front of us to try to hold the whole thing in our minds at once. We've got just over a month's worth of episodes left. That's going to take us through chapter 28 into the end of the book. And then as you know, on January 2nd, we are starting the new series where we go through the entire Bible, one book per day until we're done trying to spread the whole thing out on the table and understand better how it all fits together. So with that in mind, I'm going to have Jeff play some music and then we're going to pick up right where we left off yesterday, looking at how Matthew has set up the whole story to pay it all off in Matthew chapter 28. Then in Matthew 13, the third of the five big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured, we get a bunch of parables. One that really stands out here is the famous parable of the sower in which Jesus effectively answers the question like, why isn't everybody signing up for this thing automatically? Well, it turns out three of the four types of soil and that's a metaphor for the soul, the heart, the ears of the recipient who hears the message of the kingdom. Three of the four types of the soil aren't going to be long term receptive to the values of the kingdom. So Jesus is tempering expectations. And he also covers a bunch of other things and these parables about how the kingdom is going to grow and how that might be a little bit sneaky and people might not notice it right at first. John the Baptist gets killed by Herod in chapter 14. We're turning up the heat now on Jesus. The actual blood is being shed over this stuff. Jesus gets in a place where he would like to step away and reflect on this, but the circumstances of the disciples decision making and the needs of the people bring him right back into the fray. Entirelessly Jesus meets the needs of people in the interest of showing them the values of the kingdom. But the Pharisees they don't care about these beautiful miracles and the provision of the king. They're mad about stupid technical religious details and the tension gets ratcheted up even more at that point. Chapters 15 and 16 have tons of that in the middle. Jesus steps away, but even as he's a long ways away on a big northern road trip, he's confronted by an outsider or a woman, a Gentile who's like, Hey, me, my needs take care of my kid who's sick. And she has this beautiful back and forth with Jesus where he allows it to play out such that it's clear once again that his message of the kingdom is for everyone, even a Gentile woman outsider. And then we come back and who were the first insiders we encounter in chapter 16 and more Pharisees and Sadducees, they got the right birth certificate, but they do not have the right heart and they're so angry about who Jesus is that they want to kill him. They try to trick him by asking for a sign, but ultimately Jesus steps aside from them again and invests his energy as time is running out in his disciples. And it's there in Matthew 16 that Jesus says, well, do you think I am? I imagine this taking place around a campfire. And finally, Peter's like, yeah, I think you're the Christ, the Son of God, the Messiah. And Jesus is like, Yep. And that's not even from you. It's God who's made this apparent to you. And lest we get too excited about Peter after Jesus has some words of blessing to him or through him, Peter then turns around and defies the will of Jesus as Jesus says, I'm going to be lifted up. I'm going to be handed over and killed and raised to life. And Peter's like, no, I'll fight anybody. I ain't happening on my watch. And Jesus says, get behind me, Satan to him, making it clear that Jesus has willfully and resolutely set himself and his father has set him on a collision course with the religious leaders and with the cross. This ideology that is the opposite of the kingdom values isn't just going to operate in parallel to the kingdom. It's going to collide with the king and the kingdom. And the world values kingdom is going to kill the king. That's what he's saying. And we're not going to try to get out of it. Chapter 17, we're getting to some really weird places now, Jesus and the inner circle of his disciples go up on a mountain and there he's transfigured. And he appears to the disciples in the company of Moses and Elijah and he appears to them in at least partially his glory. Again, an echo of what we see happening with Moses all the way back in the book of Exodus. Peter again doesn't have any idea what to do with it. He's enthusiastic, but bumbles it coming down the mountain. Jesus again reiterates that he's going to die and that he is going to be resurrected on the third day. We get a final batch of Jesus tender, delicate teaching about the kingdom. In chapter 18 and 19, 18 is usually counted as the fourth of the five big speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured its instructions to the disciples for what it's going to look like when he's gone. How do you do the church? What is the kingdom on earth look like? How do you assemble these kingdom citizens? What do you do when because they're still flawed people, they get sideways with each other. You don't know how to handle these tensions. All of that Jesus seems to want to address in advance and it's covered there. In chapter 19, we encounter a rich young ruler who has everything and yet can't get it because he's unwilling to part ways with his mountains of stuff. We also encounter a whole bunch of kids who have nothing and are somehow much more prone to understanding what the kingdom is and who Jesus is. Then at the end of chapter 19 and into 20, Jesus stresses to his disciples one last time. The first are going to be last and the last are going to be first. He's stressing the upside downness of this kingdom and the kingdom values. He's trying to keep their eye on the ball for how this works. This is how we win. We don't go in swords ablaze and guns ablazing and cut down all the enemies of what is true. Instead, the son of man is going to walk into their trap, which is really no trap at all because he doesn't lay down his life against his will. He does so voluntarily. Nobody is going to take it from me and he seems to be stressing here that this is a model and playbook to be followed here moving forward. In chapter 21, we get the triumphal entry. It comes into Jerusalem. He specifically doesn't show up on a war horse but on a donkey humble. There's Bible verses popping everywhere as Matthew is connecting the dots between loose ends from the Old Testament. What is going on here? People are yelling, Hosanna. They're excited. They say, Hosanna to the son of David, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. That's a quote from Psalm 118. Jesus again in defiance of trying to get clicks and make people like him goes and does the thing that he's convicted to do next, which is purge the temple of financial abuses and greedy flips over tables. He reminds them that it's his father's house and the religious leaders are super concerned with this, but the crowds, they like him all the more. And the kids of the city, again, the ones who don't have anything, the last, the meek, they're all yelling again, Hosanna to the son of David and the religious leaders are like, Hey, Jesus, make those kids shut up. That's not anything that should be said, except for about a Messiah paraphrases mine. And Jesus replies, Yeah, if you never read from the lips of children and infants, you have ordained praise a reference to Psalm eight. And then he leaves town. He goes a mile or so out of town to a little village called Bethany stays the night. He comes back the next day. And now the religious leaders are coming out in force to shame him in front of everyone. They start by sending rookies. Jesus out maneuvers them badly on a question about authority. Jesus flips it around to demonstrate their hypocrisy and that they don't even really care about the answer. Then Jesus throws out a couple of parables that demonstrates the negligence of the religious leadership in front of everybody. It is embarrassing. He continues to reference very prominent Psalms pointing to his own authority and to him being the Messiah. He is also pointing out that their time is coming to an end. They didn't do what they were supposed to do as religious leaders. And that role that inheritance of mediator is going to be stripped from them and given to someone else. Then the Sadducees show up very strange bedfellows for the Sadducees and Pharisees to be working together on any bipartisan project was very rare at this point. The Sadducees don't even believe even resurrection. So they're going to go after Jesus about the resurrection stuff. They ask him a trick question. Jesus outmaneuvers it grandly and points out that the notion of resurrection and eternal life is baked into the Old Testament scriptures that they claim to be experts in. Then interestingly, Jesus has one last intimate, fair-minded conversation with some prominent leaders. And it seems like he might even be getting through a little bit. It looks like he even goes back over to them as a group in public and points out another very prominent reference from Psalm 110 and was like, Hey, guys, reason this thing through with me. Look, this is right. Paraphrase is very much mine, but ultimately it looks as though the Pharisees see it. They know he's got a point, but they're just painted too far into the corner. And then in chapter 23, the ship sails. Jesus issues a chapter long excoriation of the religious leadership, absolutely dressing down all of their falsehood, leaving them exposed and bear in front of all of their sycophantic followers, talking to them in a way no one would dare to talk to them. And ultimately, he proclaims that they are guilty of all the blood of all of the prophets who've come before. Finally, Jesus makes a remark saying in Matthew 23 37, Oh, Jerusalem Jerusalem, you kill the prophets and stone those who sent you how often I've longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you weren't willing. Look, your house has left you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, which interestingly is the first thing people were saying in chapter 21 when Jesus came into town writing on that donkey. In chapter 24, we get the last big speech around which the book of Matthew is structured. This is the one where on the Mount of Olives, Jesus breaks down how things are going to unfold. And he makes it clear that a lot of stuff is just going to happen. It's just the world kingdom tremoring and shaking and doing world kingdom stuff. He's telling his disciples that these things are not the sign of his coming, his return that he just got done promising there at the end of chapter 23. Then Jesus goes on to say, all right, then there's going to be this stuff. Now, if you see this stuff going on, take some precautions because now we're getting somewhere. And then finally, he talks about what it will look like right as he is returning in glory in this formal way to establish this kingdom in a visible way. He uses some short parables to illustrate that point. And then a couple of huge parables to illustrate the point that the main take home of all of these things he's telling them about timelines and how it's going to unfold is not first and foremost that you guess and speculate and fill out your calendars and have betting pools at the office for when Jesus is coming back in glory, but that the point is readiness. It's like these 10 virgins in a parable that's too long for me to break down right now. The ones who are like, Hey, we got to think through how long this night might go on. We got to make sure we have enough oil in our lamps to get through the whole thing. Their exemplary of what it is to be ready to respond to the reality of Christ's return and the establishment of this kingdom the right way. And then of course, the parable of the talents, three different servants get dealt three different investments. And two of them get it right. One of them gets it wrong. The idea is invest whatever the master has given you in this interim time in the right way. And now we're into the chaos that moves us toward the crucifixion that we've been looking at for the last few weeks. Jesus and his disciples celebrate Passover, an image from the Old Testament that predicts and points to and frames out the story of Jesus as a sacrificial lamb is about to go to the cross in the context of Passover. Jesus establishes the last supper and also reveals that it's Judas who's going to betray him. Judas does go and do that. While Judas is off arranging the betrayal and finalizing details and mobilizing an arresting party, Jesus and the disciples are out in the garden where Jesus is praying and the disciples, they just can't hang with them. They're freaking out. They're tired. They don't know what to do. They can't even stay awake on the eve of this most terrible day. And ultimately, Judas shows up, betrays Jesus with a kiss. Peter goes to start killing people and Jesus is like, nah, it's not how we're going to do it. You live by the sword. You die by the sword. And then Jesus points to some fulfillment from Zechariah and some other stuff in the Old Testament. He's taken before the religious leaders in a kangaroo court under cover of darkness. It's not even in the official place. It's in the high priest's palace. Why are we having trials there? And it's here that a bunch of false witnesses are paraded out. Finally, the religious leaders get a couple of people to say the catch phrases they wanted them to say that they think are charges that could stick against Jesus. And so under oath, I charge you says the high priest. Tell us if you're the Christ, the son of God. And Jesus says, very important here. Yes, it is as you say, then the religious leaders start ripping their clothes and they start beating on him. Peter betrays Jesus three times. We never hear from him again in the book of Matthew. He goes outside and weeps bitterly in chapter 27. Judas a little bit comes to his senses and tries to undo what he's done or a swage is guilt. That doesn't work. Jesus is sent before Pontius Pilate who has the political authority to kill people. And the religious leaders make it clear we want him dead on grounds of insurrection. Crucifixion is the punishment we want. And Pilate's like, I don't know. I don't really see it. And they're like, no, no, he's bad. And then Pilate's like, all right, well, let's try this. What about that tradition where we just release somebody this time of year? I'll just release Jesus to you. And they're like, no, we don't want him. We want the actual insurrectionist to Brabas, the murderer. Let's have him be the one that's released. We want Jesus crucified. Even Pilate's wife is like sneaking him little notes and stuff. And like, I don't, I would not have anything to do with this man. This weird, I'm telling you, I got a vision about this, which is in keeping with the motif of visions that we saw early on, particularly in the book of Matthew, particularly with Joseph. And now here on the back end, it's happening again. But here, the vision is not heated. Pilate finally relances like, I find, okay, whatever. And he hands him over for the full torture and humiliation and execution treatment. He says he's innocent of this man's blood and all the people answer, that's fine. Let his blood be on us and our children and we're taking it. That's what they're saying. So there again, we're getting an echo of something we see in the early part of the text with that idea of an ethnic inheritance and this new family of faith that goes beyond the boundaries of just what is ethnic. And then we go through the paces of the crucifixion. Jesus is mocked. He's beaten. He's abused. He can't even carry his own cross. Some guy from Africa named Simon gets roped in to carry the cross. They go to Golgotha, the place of the skull. Jesus cries out in a loud voice, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? The people who are there are confused as to what's going on. As he's calling out to Elijah, but the confusion thins out when Jesus cried out in a loud voice and gives up his spirit. And in that moment, the curtain of the temple is torn in two, representing the thing that separates God from man being torn in two. Jesus is going to be the thing that bridges that gap. The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised back to life demonstrating that Jesus is also going to defeat death and theoretically neutral or even skeptical onlookers like the centurion and the people who helped kill Jesus. They look at everything that's going on. They're like, dang, this guy was the son of God. The on paper reliable witnesses from Jesus trial proved to be unreliable. The on paper not reliable witnesses here proved to be reliable, including the women who faithfully go to the tomb. They're all there watching the whole thing. Joseph of Arimathea comes along pleads for the body pilots like, yeah, sure, great, whatever. I'm just done with this. Joseph of Arimathea. And we find out from the book of John Nicodemus to members of the Sanhedrin who were responsible for killing Jesus. These two guys weren't in on it. They wrap him up. They honor him. They bury him properly in a tomb nobody had ever been in. All of this has fulfillment echoes from the Old Testament as well. But the religious leaders come up the next day. And they're like, hey, somebody's going to try and pull some kind of resurrection scam here. Pilot, we need a guard at that tomb to make sure nobody gets deceived. Pilots like, I'm just, I'm done fine. Whatever. Just great. Do it. Go make it as secure as you want. They seal the tomb. They lock it down. The deck is stacked in every imaginable way against this one in a gajillion long shot that this guy is going to come back to life. If he does come back to life, everything about everything has changed. If he doesn't, this was a lovely story. Now we're ready for Matthew 28. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
