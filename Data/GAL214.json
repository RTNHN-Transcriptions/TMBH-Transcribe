Question. How many of you can reel off the fruits of the spirit in order right off the top of your head right now? It's rock and fire. Let it rip. Maybe you remember them from Bible camp or memory verses that you did, maybe Sunday school, maybe you're super tender-hearted Bible loving grandma or grandpa who always took you to church and was like, this is going to matter someday. Let's learn this stuff and remember it. Maybe they gave you little Bible books or something. Maybe you know the song? I'm acting like I know the song or like there is a the song for the fruit of the spirit. I don't know a song. There's got to be a song, right? This is the most obvious thing in the Bible to make a song about. I mean, if we're crying out loud, it's less obvious than the Romans 16, 19 song. How do Romans 16, 19 get a song? Roman, how does it go? Romans 16, 19 says, be excellent in what is good, be innocent of evil. And I think you just say that again. There's more to Romans 16, 19 than that. Oh, Matt, you're getting distracted. The point is there's got to be a song for the fruit of the spirit thing. And I bet a lot of you when I ask you the question, do you know what the fruit of the spirit are from Galatians 5, 22 and forward? You started singing a song in your head, but the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace and patience, kindness, goodness. I don't that did not rhyme that had no melody. I hope someone's done better at some point. Please send me a message and sing me the song if you're aware of one. Here's how the verse actually goes, whether you remember it or not. This is it. Ready? But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control against such things. There is no law. I know for some of you, you're like, no, that's for some. I've ever heard that verse in my entire life. This is all brand new to me. Don't feel weird. It's awesome. I'm glad you're here. You didn't need to know this coming in. We're covering it now. So hey, there it is. I'm the all time beloved verses or passages rather than the whole Bible. But for those of you who have read it a lot or maybe you know the song that I don't know, it has a little to it, doesn't it? There's just a rhythm that you get into love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control. I think I had somebody tell me once that there's a certain poetry to this particular list that maybe was a result of Paul. I don't think of Paul, the author of Galatians as being super poetic, I guess. But I do think of him as quoting from poems. I mean, he was knowledgeable about music and rhythm and rhyme and stuff. Philippians 2 has that famous passage about Jesus that is probably an ancient Christian hymn or something that also has a beautiful rhythm that you get into who being in very nature God did not consider equality with God, something to be grasped. He made himself nothing, taking on the very nature of his servant, being made in human likeness and being found in appearances of man. He humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross. Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Even translated over to the English from the original Greek, you can still hear the rhythm of that one. What I love about this fruit of the spirit passage as well is that there's a cadence to it that makes it stick. It's a really sticky passage. And I think that's great because it's a really important passage and a beautiful passage that we get to spend the next few days talking about. And frankly, I love the fact that the previous list, the sin list, the acts of the flesh, the acts of the sinful nature is an absolute mess in terms of cadence. It's all over the place. It's dissident. It clashes. You don't get into rhythm with it and be like, and the acts of the sinful nature are obvious sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery, idolatry in witchcraft, hatred, discordialacy, fits a rage, self-assummissioned, ascensions, factions and envy drunkenness and orgies. That did not work. I hope that does not stick in your head. The point I was trying to make is that it's a very clunky list that rhythmically doesn't work. And obviously I didn't have enough syllables left for the orgies part at the end. I'm doing my best here. We don't do two takes on music things. You just get what you get. The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. I have had it pointed out to me that even if Paul wasn't doing this in the first place, because you'd have to go and think through, you know, it would be other Greek words and syllable counts for that, that the way it works in English, it's building, it's crescendoing. You're going from monosyllabic to longer monosyllabic to bicellabic, dual syllabic to syllable words, and then on up to compound words, self-control or hyphenated word. So they just get bigger and longer and the rhythm works beautifully. And I think that's great. I think that is a gift from God, something about the way the Bible works that it gives you the impression that this is meant to stick with you. Why is this list such a big deal? Okay. Reason number one, let's just go with immediate context. It's a big deal because it's a drink of cool water in the desert of a pretty aggressive letter that is for as many times as I've read it, I just don't think I internalized how harsh and how tough this letter is to work through until I tried to do it in front of a whole bunch of people all at once. It's tough. This letter has challenged me. It's been difficult. It's challenged me spiritually. It's challenged me intellectually. It's challenged me in trying to put myself in the shoes of the original audience in a part of the world we don't know quite as much about as we do some of the parts of the world that other parts of the New Testament are directed at. It's been tough, but also the letter is very understandable. And the part, you know, once you get to understand it, it's a difficult letter because of what it says. And because so much of what it says, I mean, if I'm to be completely honest, feels like sort of a direct critique of me right now or me at other points in my life. So you know, hey, here we are. We've put on a brave face and we have soldered through Galatians together. We've made it fun. I'd like to think we just went through a brutal stretch, looking all the sin lists of the Bible and the acts of the sinful nature, the acts of the flesh from that previous passage I just saying to you and what might be the most enchanting song ever composed by humankind. And it stings. It's a tough list. Something on that list is going to hit you. Something on that list is going to hit a little too close to home. It's going to remind you of something you wish it didn't remind you. Yeah, me too. We're in that boat together. But here we hit that cool drink of water in the desert. Finally, we get some clarity of what that life by the spirit looks like. Okay, great. There's the hallmarks of what's screwed up. What are the hallmarks of what's beautiful? Walk me through that in a way that I can remember. Well, here it finally is. And when you hear the list, I don't know about you, but when I picture people who exhibit every single thing on this list, most of them are older. Most of them are people I met when they are older. Most of them are people who I imagine did not always exhibit that list entirely. Yeah, maybe they did. Some people are just freaks. I mean, they just got some kind of crazy, amazing, inherent gift toward love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. It just happened. But I'd like to imagine that most of the people I've met who exhibit this, it happened over time. It was a work of God in their lives. And there is, for me, gentleness is the one that stands out. Everybody I know who I would say, oh, yeah, wow, they're that, they're that, they're that. Yeah, all of that fruit is there. They're also not haughty about it. It's not a big deal. Like they're not advertising it. And that's where the gentleness comes in. There's an ease being at peace and one zone skinness to the people I've seen who exhibit all of this stuff. It's very admirable. It's very inviting. You look at that and you go, I don't know that I could ever be that. I don't know how one necessarily attains that. It's hard to see what the straight road is to really living all of these things out and having all of this fruit be on display. But man, when you see it, it is compelling. And I bet you're picturing someone right now in your life who has lived these things out and more than even having to do so intentionally, this is another reason why I think this is a beautiful passage and I love it is that it doesn't say, but the commands of the spirit are or but the spirit commands us no matter how hard it is to find strategies and accountability to muster the capacity to at least fake, but hopefully actually mean love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. I mean, self-control is on the list. But the word is fruit. What a weird image. Notice before, I didn't say the fruit of the sinful nature or the fruit of the flesh is obvious. Those are acts indicating that's crap you do indicating maybe to some degree that isn't necessarily you. That isn't the final defining aspect, the final word on your identity on who you are, the stuff that Jeff was talking about yesterday when I called him for a minute. There's a huge contrast here between the two lists and that the one is saying the acts, that is an outgrowth of the, I mean, it kind of reads like fruit contextually. I guess you can kind of lump the two together. But the word is the word, the acts of this sinful nature versus the fruit of the spirit. Why does fruit work? At least to the untrained heights kind of happens, right? And that's another reason I love this passage. And that's another reason that I'm glad that this list is sticky. The previous list, despite how catchy that song I just wrote was tends to not be as sticky. It's because fruit is just an outgrowth of a thing. You don't really have to coach up a healthy apple tree to apple. They're going to happen. If the thing is an apple tree genetically, and you know, the apples should happen. It's a clear indication that it is what it is and in some way it's healthy. Well, it's kind of the deal here. This really isn't, it can't be construed what we're going to be looking at here, the fruit of the spirit. It can't be construed as a New Testament 10 commandments. Well it's like the 10 commandments. You got lump, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, general self control. That's nine. But if you split out self and control, it's like 10. It's a numerology. It's like the 10 commandments. Look what we did there. Let's find a way to shoehorn all 10 of those into matching with the 10 commandments from the Old Testament and then Galatians, it's like it's fulfilling the Old Testament law by giving us a new 10 commandments. It just isn't. That's a different thing. These are in the list of commandments. This is stuff that just sort of happens. These are indicators. These are outgrowths. These are things to look at and give God thanks for that this is happening. This is what happens when the spirit isn't dwelling somebody and they're a new creation and the old is gone and the new is come. Now look, it is not hard to read through the rest of the New Testament and be like, oh, well clearly though, you can be a Christian. This will do stupid crap. Yeah. No, there's a lot of stuff in here that indicates that. Peter was pretty definitely a Christian when he did not demonstrate the fruits of the spirit through four chapters earlier here when he was being a turd at dinner in Antioch and Paul had to straighten him out. But I think Peter was probably definitely a Christian at that point. Right? So okay, there's no mystery here as to the reality that sometimes this fruit might not pop as much as others in the life of a Christian. Sometimes Christians might do stupid stuff, but this is the stuff that gives you a little glimpse into the supernatural. When you see this in a person love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control, when you see that, it's from God. It's a kind of a miracle. I mean, you're seeing a much more transcendent, much more meaningful, miraculous work of God to take something that was dead and dry bones, that being somebody's a slave to sin and death dead under the law and brought him back to life and not just like a zombie back to life, but like thriving back to life with beautiful attributes. So there's a ton of reasons that I adore this passage. And one of the reasons is not because I do all this and am all this all the time, but rather because it's a beautiful list of beautiful things that I want to see in others that I want to see in myself and that I know I struggle to muster all the time. But this is fruit, meaning that someone much more powerful than me, something much bigger than me, is it work and powerfully nurturing and bringing out this beautiful stuff, this transcendent stuff. So we have a lot to talk about here, and it's going to be fun. And I look forward to finding out what the song is about the fruit of the spirit because I probably should have known that before now.
