Music by", "url": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/thetenminutebiblehourpodcast/GAL179.mp3"}, "transcription_data": {"text": " I Understand why a vampire would say that the cross is offensive because I think it makes them sizzle I don't know when that started I don't know when vampires started actually but obviously the cross somewhere along the line it picked up some Trinket anti evil charm value is medieval superstition I don't know what I guess if you're not spheratu or something I can imagine why the cross would be offensive to you But when the Apostle Paul says in that case the offense of the cross has been abolished in Galatians 511 I read that in my book the cross seems really nice. It seems like it's something that it's like the token the insignia of Christianity and I'm a Christian like Jesus So they don't immediately think of that as being an offensive thing But over the last couple days we've been thinking about what Paul might be driving at and saying it's offensive We consider the idea that the cross is offensive to our notions of justice Because we all imagine that you when people do bad things you make an example of them sometimes You lift them up for everybody to see and be like that's what happens when somebody does something horrible It has to be dealt with by society and there's some sort of paying of a price that happens there It's weird to have the people who did the bad things not publicly suffer the penalty for it It's weird it's offensive to our notions of justice to have Jesus the good guy suffer for it additionally yesterday We considered that Paul when he talks about the offense of the cross is probably referencing back to stuff He said in Galatians 3 that's a quote from back in the Old Testament in the book of Deuteronomy talking about how the the Old Testament law itself says The curse does anybody who doesn't obey everything written in this law and cursed is anybody who's hung on a tree or hung on a pole and Jesus became a curse for us Paul says that's offensive Jesus was the good guy Seems pretty wild that he would have to take on the curse of the law But not just take it on like we talked about a second ago, but become the curse Okay, that's offensive as well. That all seems to make sense to me. Let's push it a little bit further Why else is the cross and what it stands for the cross of Christ? Offensive well, how about this? It's offensive because it's icky. It's ugly It's the kind of thing that you don't want to look at I maybe morbid people do But if you think about what crucifixion actually is and what it represents It's it's not something that a healthy person wants to feast their eyes upon I'm not gonna get into all the details about how the body is mutilated and tortured. I mean it's been covered a bajillion times in a bajillion different places, but it's bad It's a really mean form of execution. Maybe one of the top five meanest that was invented in the ancient world I can't put it number one because There are some very very clever means of torture that people invented to deal with traders particularly and people who killed their own kin killed their own parents They were the ones who got the worst Torturous deaths in the ancient world. So Jesus didn't get the kins layers death He got culturally the insurrectionist death the traitor the the treasonous Form of execution the same thing that Spartacus got for throwing a revolution or attempting to do so So the crime associated with the public spectacle of the cross as part of why it's offensive But also the actual that you're suffering and ugliness and what happens to the human body while that's going on is offensive Also the fact that at people were I mean they were crucified naked we understand this right? I mean it's Overwhelmingly likely that everybody you got crucified was on full display so that you could see Everything their body was going through it was a profoundly offensive thing to show and an R rating for a true full view of a crucifixion would be Insufficient it exceeds what could be shown in a theater or on television Imagine the worst stuff you've seen and even even that you just you can't go there for what happens Visually when somebody gets crucified so it's it's ugly It's hideous then we get a little bit of that Kind of a nod to that. I think an anticipation of that in Isaiah chapter 53 of course That's what it is because that's where so much of the the New Testament references back to Isaiah a lot of those come from Isaiah 53 Particularly Yeah, I'm just gonna start from the beginning of this passage I've read it to you before you're gonna recognize this right away Who has believed our message and to whom is the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoot like a root out of dry ground He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him nothing in his appearance so that we should desire him He was despised and rejected by mankind you can see where this is going a man of suffering and familiar with pain Like one from whom people hide their faces He was despised and we held him in low esteem surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering Yet we considered him punished by God stricken by him and afflicted but he was pierced for our transgressions He was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds. We are healed Okay, I mean there's a lot there but come on you're smart. You're picking up what I'm putting down here the offense of the cross And it's all summed up right there. They couldn't even look like one from whom people hide their faces Isaiah's prophesying that nobody keep and look on what's happening here in this moment where He is pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities But then Isaiah rounds out the thought saying that all of that punishment that brought peace was on him and by his wounds We are healed. It's both levels of offensiveness right there in Isaiah chapter 53. It's hideous. It's ugly It's gross to behold you'd want to censor this and definitely not show kids It would turn your stomach and make you want a puke to actually look at this spectacle But also it's an affront to our notions of how justice and retribution ought to be Because the punishment that bought us peace was just it's on that one guy And by his wounds we're healed so stuff we deserved he took so we have the offenses It relates to notions of justice. We have the offense as it relates to the the curse of the Old Testament being hung on a Tree from Galatian chapter three. We have the curse of this being visually offensive a shocking form of death Associated with the worst kind of behavior And then finally it's offensive to our notions of self and self-sufficiency It's offensive in the same way that if you're doing a task that you're perfectly capable of doing And somebody comes along and they're like here. Let me just jump in there and get that for you. You're like hey, hey, hey Knock it off. I know how to do this Stop it. Well that little impulse that we have as people over trifling tasks that we think we can manage on our own Is amplified all the more when it's not a trifling task and instead the task is getting our crap together and Getting right with god and nailing the point of life We would like to imagine we can do that And probably all of us go through an extended phase. Maybe it's in youth. Maybe it's later where we really think we actually are Where we are so not self-aware that we actually think we're getting it right that we actually think we're killing it Like some kid who goes out to sing the national anthem because their dad owns the team But it's horrible Yet all of their affectations and approach to how they're singing the anthem makes it feel like they're absolutely crushing it But they're not It's ghastly and everybody else can see We Somehow can delude ourselves into imagining that we're barely touched by the human problem at points in our lives That we really hey back off I can handle this task that we really can handle it that we really can through self-discipline and exertion Defeat the effects of time and forgetfulness and also selfishness and temptation and doing things that we think there Won't be consequences for because nobody saw it. We can't beat it We are touched by the human problem On so many levels that we know of and even more that we don't we own that On so many levels that we know of but even more that we didn't even catch in ourselves As the POV character of our own story So then understandably it could be pretty offensive if along comes god or anyone is like, let me just get in there for you This isn't going to work out. You're you're not going to get this project right? Hey, hey Now back off a minute here buster I've got a pretty good resume and a pretty good track record I'm quite certain I've got this project under control Well, no the project of the care of our soul is not under control the project of absolution for sin for Atonement for what's gone wrong in the past that we can't change no, it's not under control and so The whole thing of the cross is just a giant visual metaphor that people get tattooed on themselves And they put up on hills around town that you see when you go to church. It's a giant Visual reminder You don't got this You can't handle the project. I can't handle the project You have one way One way out of this thing the one way is faith in god dependence on god That's it. He can solve this gigantic problem. You have you can't solve it the fundamental mistake Of the agitators who came to the Galatian churches is that they were saying Maybe you can solve it. You just need to do a few more things You need to do a few more steps. You need to make a few snips on some tender areas of the flesh and You can handle the project and Paul is saying is it seriously you're going to stiff arm god? You're going to be like no, no, no. I've got this thing. Well by saying Hey, if you go and get circumcised, that's basic. I mean the metaphor is mine But I don't think I'm stretching it at all here from what we're getting Galatians 5 If you go and get circumcised In this context with the meaning that is applied to it here not just circumcision in general But Galatian church given the conversation and why you're doing it If you go get adult circumcised you are stiff farming god Who has walked over and is looking at your project that you are botching but that you feel like you're nailing He is offered to step in and solve it because you can't and instead you're saying no back off Hey, you're being nosy and you're getting my business. I can handle it Well The cross is very offensive to that notion of pride and self-sufficiency that I have that you have that everybody has because implicit and really explicit in the message and meaning of the cross is You don't got this You need me. I'm speaking in the voice of god right now That's weird and a bit of an overstep, but I think you know what I mean You need me to step into this And solve the thing that must be solved but that you cannot solve Yeah, I sing the songs at church and I memorize the bible verses and I celebrate this But also there's a part of me Despite how long I've been around it that is kind of put off by the fact that I can't do it myself Why not myself? Why shouldn't I be able to? Well because sin is a pernicious thing and the human problem is undefeated by humans Only jesus can beat it and the cross is a symbol that reminds us of that and because of that and a handful of other reasons Yeah, the offense of the cross that turn of a phrase makes sense I get another verse I want to read you about that, but we're at a time So I'll do that at the beginning tomorrow and then we get on to the final little phrase here Which is going to be an adventure Because it has castration in it what I better go. I'm matt.
