long time and then eventually a camp director and straighten my shirt that's kind of a big deal one of the things that I got to do when I graduated to camp director was get the big six D cell mag light out that was way overkill and patrol the outside of things so that the youngsters wouldn't get any kind of a little hanky panky hijinks trouble making kind of nonsense and so I would just hang out in the woods and camp late at night and watch what the kids were doing and every now and then sure enough here comes some kids creeping along in the dark to somebody else's cabin and blammo I hit them with that light and they'd all look guilty and scared and then they'd all switch from guilty and scared to like what we were just doing a thing that we needed to do and those were always the best excuses ever and I just real easy is like if you're out at night and you're sneaking around like little turds it's because you're definitely doing something wrong there's no reason for you to be sneaking whatever your plan was there is probably real stupid and it would have been better to have been done during the light and then I send it back to their cabin but weirdly on the sneaking front I've got this friend and he's a great friend and I really like his style but he also sneaks a little bit but the weird thing is that he sneaks in such a way that it's only to the benefit of other people it's a very unusual personality trait this is a very generous very cool friend I've come to really admire the clever working behind the scenes for the benefit of others in ways that they might not even notice and that he will surely never get credit for the point is or might I say likewise sneaking in the biblical narratives that we see can have a lot of different connotations right off the bat it looks like sneaky equals bad but at times we see the sneak being weaponized for some kind of good motives and I think that is what we are seeing in Matthew chapter 9 as we get to this third clump of demonstrations of miraculous authority from Jesus coming off of the sermon on the Mount we're in the middle of the third clump and we're in the one about the two blind guys who were like what Jesus is walking by Jesus hey Jesus well specifically they say hey son of David have mercy on us which is code for heal our blindness because we think you can do that and Jesus just cruises right by we don't really get a sense right at that moment in the text as to why he just cruised right by you know what I have a Bible here as Jesus went on from there to blind men followed him calling out have mercy on us son of David and we had gone indoors the blind men came into him and they asked them do you believe that I'm able to do this yes Lord they replied then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith will it be done to you and their site was restored then Jesus sternly warned them see that no one knows about this but they went out and spread the news about them all over that region and I'll add the word anyways okay so it first look like Jesus just blew him off or maybe missed the cues but now we see he had a plan all along he wanted this miracle to unfold in secret in the dark which is kind of ironic because the whole miracle is about illuminating that which was dark so we're going to break down why that might have been or what the deal was there in just a minute so once again backtracking just for a second to where we were yesterday the greeting that these guys throw out is have mercy on us son of David that's kind of a loaded term but at the most basic level it means that they were suspecting that Jesus was the Messiah descended from David obviously not like literally and immediately there is some generations in there and whatnot but this is the guy who is the little shoot that's coming out of the burned-out stump of the line of Jesse Jesse was David's dad and that prophecy everybody in the original audience knew it is from Isaiah and famously it's this glimmer of hope that's being held out after all of the ugly events of the Old Testament and the failure of the northern kingdom the southern kingdom and it looks like God's chosen people are just belly up and nothing is ever going to work out and all the beautiful promises of God could never come true the promises that he made to David to establish his beautiful unending kingdom with his eternal king and everything being worked out and straightened out and it's all going to come through these people and through the line of David and now but now there's no kingdom there's no throne how can this possibly work out well that's why that passage in Isaiah was so clung to so valued and that's why people were looking forward to the son of David but son of David at this point meant a lot of different things it didn't just mean Jesus or Messiah as maybe Christians think about that or Jesus or Messiah in kind of the socially encouraging equitable sense that maybe somebody who respects Jesus but wouldn't say they're a theist somebody from that can't might attribute that version of Messiah to him no this conjured for a lot of people a very different version of that a military leader who would come and undo the damage done by Rome restore things to the glory that King David experienced with all of his wealth and his son Solomon's wealth and their political dominance and hobnobbing with fancy people like the Queen of Sheba and whoever else wanted to come out and check out their awesome stuff that they had built and as you know as a sophisticated person living in the 21st century stuff means stuff everything means something at the most basic level not all the fingers mean the same thing one finger means your number one another finger right next door to that one means something much meaner everything means something words are loaded words are politically loaded and phrases that you could have uttered 15 years ago that would have been utterly innocuous and meaningless now really mean something and are gonna set off a fire in people's brain this way or that way and honestly again making no statement whatsoever about anything here how about the phrase black lives matter or all lives matter things that would not have set off a firestorm very recently now all of a sudden that's very loaded if you understand that then you can understand what exactly is going on here son of David sounds really harmless to you and me but it wasn't it meant something and that phrase and that nickname catches on too early on in the game here that's kind of a dog whistle to bring in the conspiracy revolutionary types it's also a good way to bring to the attention of the Roman authorities that something is cooking over here and it would seem that Jesus didn't want that attention on him how am I arriving at this conclusion well it's very simple actually what we have is something of a literary parallelism in the editing style of Matthew here so in this third chunk of miracles that we're seeing coming off the sermon on the Mount it opens with outcasts in society boldly approaching Jesus in a way that would be pretty weird and saying in so many words I know you can heal me and then Jesus looking back and being like yeah I can and that's good faith and let's do this thing in the story about the leper it's okay when he came down from the mountainside this is a eight one large crowds followed him a man with leper so he came and knelt before him and said Lord if you're willing you can make me clean see and matches Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man okay that's also how he healed the blind guys I am willing he said Jesus obviously in tone to the same thing in the miracle with the blind guys and then he says be clean and immediately he was cured of his leprosy but then Jesus said to him see that you don't tell anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded as a testimony to them and you can go back and listen to the whole episode that we did on that particular topic where we took a little more time to break down why he might have said that obviously that miracle looks like it happened in front of people so some people caught on to what was going on but it seems like the idea here is don't tell anybody go and do all of the ritual cleansing thing because it's gonna really cause it to dawn on people like no this guy's like legitimately religiously clean not just healed by everything's right this is amazing and then eventually come back around to Jesus that oh he can declare things clean something that we saw him just do with the woman who had the bleeding here just a minute ago but the one thing that is different between these two parallel miraculous accounts is the way it starts the blind man doesn't address Jesus as the son of David he just says Lord which sounds pretty fancy because of the way we think about the word now but really that was just a basic honorific title for any normal person of any kind of authority think mister or master Lord didn't necessarily mean I think you're God or the ways that we would think of it now so we've gone from a pretty skeptical greeting of Jesus when all of these authority stories start after the sermon on the Mount to son of David so what changed over that span of time that one person is like I guess Lord and other people are like whoa son of David we see you for who you are even though we can't see anything at all well that's really interesting what changed I think is that exactly at the midpoint between those two stories is even in terms of pretty much word count you get the story of Jesus going out and calming that storm on the Sea of Galilee and what did the disciples say after that happens they say what kind of man is this even the winds and the waves obey him and then the very next thing which also represents the middle point to the top of the narrative structural mountain between the two miracles we're looking at here and the demons are like whoa we know you are what do you want with us son of God so what has happened is there's a question that is flirted with coming off of the mountain he teaches with all this authority it's different than other people and we'll call him Lord for now let's see what happens and then all of these demonstrations of authority occur and then if the question wasn't obvious enough already the disciples are credited with asking it who is this guy the demons start to hint at it and he's like no no I'm not doing that right now and then finally apparently it's just become so evident that even a blind guy can see it see what I did there or rather I should say see what Matthew did there and I like that we can't see a dang thing but we know you're the Messiah you're the son of David so then in light of that in light of the connotations that go with it picture Jesus response he's like yeah and we're just gonna be cool and roll by that for now if you read your kid or a friend maybe just isn't getting what's going on socially in the moment come up and just blur something out about I how the things are that's totally not discreet and you're like dude you are killing me right now you can't play it off you can't make it go away all you can do is maybe ignore it until they force you to acknowledge it Jesus was not going to get forced to acknowledge that title is it the right title yeah but is that title crazy loaded yeah it's crazy loaded and we can't just go around barking this out at this point in the game yet it strategically is not Jesus game plan and we know that Jesus is really into the strategy thing because he's gonna say as much in chapter 10 we'll get over there in a little bit so he slow rolls by them and then like a primitive 8-bit video roleplay game he's not surprised at all when they just walk right into his house and start pressing the a button and having dialogue with him and in fact he initiates and he's like okay we're in here now guys I know you were coming okay so do you believe I am able to do this the question doesn't seem that weird to them they know what the whole social exchange is about here and apparently they fully anticipated that he would engage them when they got in the house and they're like yeah yes Lord and so they believe that they touch their eyes and then he says according to your faith it will be done to you again this doesn't look like it's a neat tidy quid quo pro I always struggle with that phrase but rather it's in keeping with your faith here is a measure of fixing and redeeming and healing that looks a lot like that again I don't think there's a magic formula here where you say the right phrase to Jesus you get him over a barrel and he has to do your miracle thing no matter what it might be but this does illustrate a point even the blind guys could see this is the son of David but Jesus is still in a place where we're not gonna go around and just trumpet that at this point yet now there are other places beyond the parallel miracle back there in chapter 8 with the leper that we just looked at where he does the same thing most notably in chapter 12 and chapter 17 oh verse 9 yeah that's right because this is coming off of the transfiguration and Jesus is like yeah let's not tell anybody about this until you see that the son of man has returned from the dead so it's like Jesus is pacing this thing out a little bit he doesn't want it to come to a head yet there are buttons that he wants to push but he wants to be the button pusher there are times when he's gonna fiercely push back on the religious leadership the people who seem to be against the kingdom or just missing it the people who seem to be blind and we're gonna break that down more tomorrow and there are other times where he's cool with letting other people and seemingly random circumstances move the thing forward now if you're sitting here processing this with me whether you are a person of devoted faith trying to figure this thing out not sure what to make of it and maybe rebuilding adult faith for yourself for the first time or not faith at all it's still pretty easy for all of us to be in the same boat and high five and be like oh that's pretty cool I see what the guys doing there good strategy is good strategy he's playing this thing very smart we all know what it looks like on social media when somebody explodes through the wall like the Kool-Aid man is like hey here's all my opinions about everything I'm totally right about all this stuff agree or we're enemies it's just dumb that's not a way to set yourself up for a long-term presence in that space you're picking a fight right off the bat people are gonna jump to conclusions without hearing you out it is not a good strategy we also know what it looks like when somebody is smart when they're so invested in the thing that they're doing that they take the time to think strategically about it to see the good ends that they're trying to bring about accomplished I think that's something that all of us can agree is a pretty impressive strategic mindset on the part of Jesus that is him knowing his audience and understanding the moment in history in which he is operating better than anybody else in the game 4d chess to borrow an expression from a friend tomorrow we got to talk about the blind thing and what the blind thing means and where it fits into all of this and I think that'll be a really fun conversation that'll have us back in the Old Testament a little bit as well all right I've had fun processing sneaky Jesus maneuvering with you today we'll go and look at the whole concept of blindness and where that fits in with the Old Testament is pretty interesting stuff that we're gonna get into tomorrow in the meantime my name is Matt this is 10 minute Bible Hour podcast I really like you let's do this again soon", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.98,
