This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and this is a content warning. We're gonna be talking about all kinds of stuff that get real weird this time around. I know that some of you listen to this with your children and I think that if you don't listen to this first, it's going to inflict incredibly awkward conversations on you and your family. So if you want to, maybe just give this one a spin first and then you can invite the kids along later if you feel like it. All right, Jeff's gonna play some music and we're gonna get after it. We're Matthew chapter 22. Jesus has made his way into Jerusalem. Everybody's real excited about it even though I don't know exactly who he is. They haven't got that figured out yet. That is everybody except the religious leaders. They don't like it a bit and all the different various stripes of religious and political leaders are taking swipes of Jesus and it's just not working out for them because Jesus is Jesus and they're whoever they are. So the Pharisees try it and they come out looking stupid. Jesus hits them with some parables and make them look real bad. And then the Herodians, the political group come out with the mini Pharisees. They try it with some trick question about pay and taxes to Caesar. Jesus shoots that down. They look bad. Now the Sadducees are taking their turn and they think they have cracked the code for how to defeat Jesus in this social situation. So they come up to him verse 23 of Matthew 22. It goes like this. That same day, the Sadducees who say there's no resurrection came to him with a question. They came to Jesus. That is what the question that we talked about the Sadducees as a minority political party. We've talked about the reality that they didn't believe in the resurrection. We've looked at the Old Testament to see whether the notion of resurrection of the dead or eternal life is there. It is. We've made sure that we remember all the different places or many of the different places where Jesus talks about eternal life and the resurrection of the dead and Matthew. Yep, sure enough, that seems to be all over the place as well, which brings us to their question, verse 24. Teacher, they said, Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him. Wait, what? Okay, we're going to have to come back to that just because, wow, okay, we're going to come back to that. Now there were seven brothers among us. They continued. This is verse 25. The first one married and died. And since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. Oh, the same thing happened to the second and third brother right on down to the seventh. Finally, the woman died. Now then at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven since all of them were married to her? Well, actually, I'm sure they felt very, very clever. I'm sure they looked at how the other groups got it wrong. And they were like, he works in stories. He defeats you with stories. We're just going to make up a story and it's going to make his compass spin and we're going to break him and embarrass him in front of everyone. So they're going to try to out parable Jesus, which is entertaining. And we're going to break down their little parable, their little story that they've concocted next time around. But first there was a needle scratch moment a little while back there. There's a thing about if somebody dies and they don't have any kids, then that person's brother has to marry the widow and have sex with her and then they're supposed to have babies. What, huh? That's in the Bible. Are you kidding? And I'm sure some of you are like, Oh, yeah, that's right. That is in the Bible. Because you've poked around in the Old Testament and you remember because it stood out to you back there because it sounds weird. And others of you were like, huh, this was all starting to sound interesting to me. And then that that I don't, I don't know if I can, I don't know if I can roll with that. I'm not sure that seems like such a good idea. Well, we in order to move forward in this passage have got to speak to this practice and where it comes from the name of the practice is a leveret marriage like Levi, right marriage, L-E-V-I-R-A-T-E marriage. And at least the first example that I can think of this really playing a role in the narrative is in Genesis 38. And this story gets bonkers. Remember, there is a content warning on this episode. This story in Genesis 38 is big. So I'm going to give you the quick version here. The main character of the story is a guy named Judah. Judah is the son of Jacob. So he is one of these children who together are the patriarchs of the 12 tribes of Israel and Judah is one of those. And so what that means is that Judah is one of the brothers who got jealous of Joseph and chucked him into a pit and sold him into slavery. So he's kind of a chump. He's not a great looking dude from the beginning. And then chapter 38 is all about what goes down with his family, which is weird. Now here's what you got to remember. When we're in Genesis 38, we are still so far into the dawn of recorded and remembered history. We are at a time where the laying out of the ground rules of the law of Moses. I none of that stuff has even happened yet. We haven't been into captivity in Egypt yet. This is still the really, really shockingly tribal early going. And it looks at least like some of the ground rules are a little bit different in this very fledgling stage of this family of faith that God is building out of the line of Abraham. And in fact, we are still very close to Abraham chronologically. Genealogically, we're very close. Abraham's son was Isaac. Isaac's son was Jacob who took on the name Israel and Israel's son, then is Judah. So we're really, really close to like the beginning of the this whole story and all the characters who are involved in it. So okay, now you got that framed up. Here's what went down. Judah goes and marries a Canaanite lady and she gives birth to son. The son's name is Er, like E. R. Literally, that's the whole name. She has another son named Onan and then she has another son named Shela. This is an ancient world patriarchy. Judah does what he's supposed to do. He goes out and he gets a wife for Er and her name is Tamar. And all the text tells us is that Er, Judah's firstborn was wicked in the Lord's site, verse seven of Genesis 38. So the Lord put him to death. That's it. Don't know why. Don't know what the deal was. Don't know what he did. That's just kind of how the language of Genesis is at times. So then the leverate marriage thing happens. And Judah says to Onan, you'll recall that's his secondborn. Like, you got to go and redeem that marriage. Your brother didn't have a kid. And implicitly, what he's saying is if we don't do this in this way, because of the clan society we live in, we lose property and we can't keep this thing together. This is your obligation. And it would be their obligation to you if the shoe were on the other foot. But Onan's like, not, I'm not doing it. But he feels pressured to kind of make it look like he did it. Remember content warning. So he has sex with Tamar, but he pulls out and there's some Bible language to describe what pulling out is about. And famously, the phrase spilled his seed on the ground is used here. And he's intentionally trying not to impregnate Tamar. He does want to. There could be all kinds of selfish motivations for that, but he didn't want to. Verse 10 says, what he did was wicked in the Lord's sight. So the Lord put him to death also. Well, at this point, Shailah is a kid. So he can't redeem the marriage. This has to be very troubling for Judah. And so he tells Tamar, like, you got to live in our house. And then eventually he'll grow up. So Tamar is around, but she's on the fringes. Her position here isn't very safe. Time goes by. And then Judah's wife dies. And he goes on a road trip somewhere. And along the way, he runs into a prostitute who seems interesting and he has sex with her and she gets pregnant. And then he comes back and Tamar reveals that like, it was me, I was the prostitute in disguise. You were not upholding your patriarchal duty to make sure that I had a kid and that my late husband, Er's line would be sustained. You weren't doing that. So I took matters into my own hand. Judah's all mad and like killer. And then he's like, well, you know, I guess since you're revealing that. And in a way, he kind of repents of it, sort of in a Genesis 38 kind of sense of repentance. But then literally the way the story goes is up to this point. He doesn't realize that he's the dad of pregnant Tamar. And then she has some items that cause him to realize, Oh, no, it was me. And then he decides not to kill her. And she has kids twins. In fact, one of those kids is Zara and the other of those kids is Perez. And there's your summary of Genesis 38, which seems like why is that even in the Bible until you go to the book we're looking at, which is the book of Matthew. And you go to the very beginning, like 500 episodes ago, and you look at the genealogy, you're like, all right, I record the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, the son of Abraham, we just kind of blew by this for whatever. Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Oh, that's what we're talking about. Jacob was the father of Judah. Oh, and his brothers. Oh, that's right. Yeah, through Joseph in the Pit and the coat thing and everything, Judah was the father of Perez and Zara, whose mother was Tamar. Oh, Matthew gives us that so nice and tidy and sanitized. But every single reader of the genealogy and Jesus and Matthew chapter one would have remembered who Judah was, what went down with Tamar and how that all happened and how weirdly unlikely Perez would have been to exist at all, let alone be one who is one link in the chain of the genealogical history that wraps up in verse 16, where it says on Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus, who is called the Christ. The line of Judah was important. That is the line out of whom the Christ to the Messiah was to come. And so this weird ancient Near Eastern practice, this tribal practice of leverate marriage was used in that situation to get us all the way down to this place of Jesus. And apparently that's why it was such a big deal and why God was interacting with the whole situation the way he was as it was unfolding. All of that is to say that that to me is the most fascinating, even scandalous example of leverate marriage and the first example of it that I can remember from the Bible. The other much more beautiful redeeming one also occurs in the lineage of Christ. And that is the story of Ruth and Boas. That is effectively a redeem the marriage more modernized, more civilized version from a more civilized time of the same kind of familial situation unfolding. And so interestingly, we have two of these kind of moments that are pivotal in the unfolding of the story and the unfolding of time that gets us all the way up to the birth of Christ. So that just makes it all the more cute then when the Sadducees show up and they try to weaponize parables, which is Jesus' game against Jesus, as well as trying to weaponize leverate marriage against Jesus. When the whole reason that Jesus exists is that God the Father ordained that this strange practice would be used in a different time in a different cultural context to get us to this point using ugly, weird things to redeem and make beautiful things. It all seems to kind of fit into the grand narrative and the thematic material of what redemption in the Bible is all about. And now that we got that in our hip pocket, we are finally ready to go and take a closer look at this little parable trap that they throw out at Jesus next time around.
