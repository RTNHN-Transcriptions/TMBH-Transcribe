That is not the case. I think it's great. I think Esther is great. But still, as I've told you before, I got this thing about skipping forward in narratives. Everything's exciting and you're invested in all the characters and then a title pops up on your TV show or your movie. It just says five years later. You're like, ah, what? It's like I just watched everybody age in an instant, five years of their lives and their stories and who they are just gone. That hurts my heart. I grieve it a little bit when I'm really engaged with the characters. That's kind of one of my nightmares is that I would miss time with the people I love and the stories I love. And so it's difficult. That said, I totally get why that happens in stories though, because not every story is trying to do what catches my eye or what I'm interested or the tangents I'd like to run down. Good stories are chasing down one big narrative thread in the book of Esther. We're about to get a significant time jump that's going to happen between Esther three six and Esther three seven. I feel a little bit of grief over this, but I get it. The book of Esther is not written to try to fill in the details of the reign of King Xerxes. It might be fun if that were the case and I would love to know more than what history gives us at this point about the reign of King Xerxes. But we got what we got. And this isn't a story about him or about Persia or ancient history or any of that. It's a story about an inattentive, easily manipulatable king who gets lonely and takes a wife who he doesn't really properly vet under odd circumstances. And then a little bit later on, there's a conflict between a Jew and an Aggagite that threatens to result in the genocide of all of the Jewish people. And then only this unlikely hero, this queen is positioned to do anything about it. What's going to happen? And that's before we even frame up the narrative thrust of this story in light of the entire Bible, which obviously has even bigger consequences yet. So that's what we're doing here. There's a bunch of stuff that happens in the reign of Xerxes that we know. There's so much more that we don't know, but it simply isn't relevant. And that's why we're going to get this time jump forward. That said, anytime we have a time jump, we got to reset the stage a little bit for where we're at historically and what the characters are thinking about now. This is what we get. I'm just going to pick a spot here and go with it. We'll start in chapter three, verse five. When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged. Yet having learned who Mordecai's people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead, Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes. Now we get the time jump. Verse seven, in the 12th year of King Xerxes in the first month, the month of Nissan, well, there it is. So we just blasted forward from December of 479, maybe January of 478 to the spring, March or April of 474. There's a lot four, four and a half years, something like that. A lot happens in that amount of time. And most noticeably, Xerxes is gone from a king in his 30s to a king well into his 40s. He's no doubt added a few grays to his beard and to his hair. And the equation has flipped for us as the reader from dealing with a Xerxes who has most of his reign ahead of him to dealing with a Xerxes who has most of his reign behind him. We're 12 years in, he has nine years to go at this point. Now he doesn't know that. Of course, I mean, I don't schedule the end of your reign. But as this guy gets into his 40s, even from the scant historical evidence we have of what his reign was like in the four seventies, we can see that he's got a lot of pressures cooking during this decade. First of all, we can tell from archeology and inscriptions that he left behind for us that in the four seventies, okay, now he's got the grease thing in the rear view mirror and these got governors in places they're governing or whatnot. He's not lonely anymore. He satisfied missing Vashty. He's got at least one super angry wife who's still difficult. He mutilated one of his rival lovers here just a few years back coming off of that unfortunate sordid affair where Xerxes had a whole lot of dalliances with his daughter in law and sister in law. It got real ugly. He was messing around with this whole family that resulted in more parts of Xerxes family throwing a rebellion. And so Xerxes had to put that down. That's happening somewhere in here. He's also building. Sousa and he's taking Persia to this whole new engineering and architectural level that his father had never imagined. And he's expanding the temple complex and Sousa to this thing that we call the Apadana. You can still go and see little remnants of it. It's like this hall of a hundred columns and gigantic sculptures and reliefs and he's overseeing all of that. That's a very expensive proposition and no doubt very consuming. So that is cooking in this interim right here between where we were in Esther three six and now where we are in Esther three seven. Additionally, you've got some princes who are starting to factor pretty meaningfully into Persian culture and Persian court life. Darius the younger son of a mistress, the wife who had an axe to grind no pun intended. He would be probably a pretty functional young man by this point. He has received a governorship, but all kinds of noble training. Esther Mordecai, Heyman, they all would have known Darius the younger. He's the presumptive successor to the king. He seems perfectly competent, but there's another Prince running around the palace and starting to factor in things as well. And that's Darius his younger brother, Artaxerxes. It doesn't look like he's going to get the throne, but he's going to factor prominently. He's promising as well. He's well trained, but also brewing around the court scene in these five years that have just passed is a whole bunch of drama with the Unix and the wives of these officials and noble court members. It looks like there's a whole lot boiling here and it looks like the vultures are starting to circle by the mid four seventies and no doubt Xerxes is aware that there's some shenanigans going on. It's hard for him to cut through it or see through it, but there's some nonsense happening and I tell you what, that nonsense ends up resulting in one of the king's officials, another guy named Artabanus, assassinating Xerxes and then trying to pit Artaxerxes and Darius the younger against each other. He succeeds after maybe this Artabanus guy even had a seven year miniature or a seven month rather miniature reign during this interregnum before Artaxerxes kills Darius the younger and establishes himself as king. Then he gets rid of Artabanus and everybody else who participated in the scheme to kill his dad. Now Artaxerxes is a very interesting king when we get to know him because he's super sympathetic to the Jewish people, super, super trusting and sympathetic. The details of his reign and his relationship with Nehemiah and Ezra are indicative of him being moved by the events of Esther, maybe even new Esther. He has to favor him and showed him care and protection and offered insights for him as well. We don't get to know that. All we get to know is the results. Here's what I'm driving at though. Herodotus, the historian we've been relying on for so many of the details about Xerxes reign. He really only gives us details about the first half of Xerxes reign, maybe even the first third. Now, he's out of the picture and we're having to depend on some second hand accounts of lost histories that were written by other people. Maybe most notably this guy named T.C.S. We don't even have his books anymore, but we have a later Greek physician's recollections of what he read in T.C.S.'s 23 volumes of history about all of this stuff. We know T.C.S. thought Herodotus was a liar and called him out, but T.C.S.'s stories that we have, they don't totally hold water either. But what little details we do get second hand from T.C.S. about the later reign of Xerxes or his reign in the 470s is it was very tumultuous. He had all these pressures that I just described. All that stuff would have been weighing him down. And when we take all of that into account, it's easier to imagine how this version of Xerxes, who's very different than war council version of Xerxes early on, how this version of Xerxes would have his trusted advisor come in, who maybe he's outsourced a lot of authority to. And the advisor's like, hey, we got a problem with some people we should commit genocide against them. And we can imagine how this distracted Xerxes might be like, I'm sorry, I could have swore you said something about genocide. Hey, man, I am, I'm up to here. I got so much going on. I'm trying to build this giant palace, the best the world has ever seen. My first wife, my main wife who mutilates people, she still seems real mad about things. I don't know that I can completely trust her. Trying to keep my sons from murdering each other. I would hate it if that happened. I'm trying to not get assassinated. And it seems like there's a bunch of stuff going on here at court. What were you saying again? Somebody needs to be genocideed or something. Yeah. Okay, great. Sure. Fine. Just get that knocked out for me. I'm sorry. I don't even remember what we were talking about. You can imagine a Xerxes like that with this much stuff cooking. And remember, all the stuff that I just said was cooking. It's all happening within the walls of Susa, the capital city. We don't even know anything about what's going on in the grander empire of Persia, other than it's growing, it's thriving. There are tons of people in it. No doubt that's an incredible distracting heavy burden for Xerxes who seems to be maybe floundering under the pressure. My guess is the original audience had a sense of the deterioration of the reign of Xerxes that is much more informed than anything that has trickled down to us from these ancient historians. But all that can be as a guest. So time has passed. We got a different Xerxes now. This is consequential time that has passed. And we've got a bad guy, an enemy who is clearly biting his time, waiting until the moment is right to achieve this goal that doesn't really serve Persia or his king in any way. That only serves himself and his evil ambitions. But he's got to find a way to put lipstick on it and present that to his king on a day when he's kind of distracted with other stuff. And that's what we're going to get here in the next couple of verses that we'll look at over the next few days. Sorry about my voice. Been sick for a couple of days. I appreciate you suffering with me through that. I have one more thing on the way out the door. And that is to let you know that my dad wrote a book. It's called House Church Now. And I'm proud of my dad. He's a really talented man who's done a lot of great things and has selflessly invested in a ton of other people. He is tirelessly and selflessly invested in me as a dad of a kid and now as a dad of an adult. And I love him very much and I'm proud of him. And he wrote a book that I think really jabs the bear in some interesting ways and that raises a bunch of great questions. It's a tour through the history of the early church and what it looked like for the earliest Christians to do church not in any established building, but in their homes forming a church community in each city in that kind of environment. And then he considers implications and what might be learned from that now. And I think it's an interesting read. And I think if you're into church or into church history or maybe even if you're in a place where you're thinking about what you're doing with church or what you might want that to look like for you and your family, this could be a really good book for you. So obviously this is not a sponsorship. My dad didn't sponsor the episode. I'm just straight up asking you to consider going out and buying my dad's book because I think you're going to like it. And also I love my dad and I wanted to tell you about his book. It's called How Church Now. There'll be a link down below. Thanks for considering that. All right, I'm Matt.
