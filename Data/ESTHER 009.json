    "text": " We're talking yesterday about how cool I think it is that some people get to go out into interesting ancient parts of the world and dig for stuff and then actually find things and then you and I can look at those things and learn things and feel connection with the people who made them, even if the people who made them were thousands and thousands of years back in history from us. I think that stuff is absolutely rad and I've never got to experience that myself, but I've got a buddy who did. We've done a couple of videos together. His name is John Monson and this dude, he grew up in Israel and his dad was into the archeology scene there and there's this amazing discovery some time ago that every student of ancient history learns about, every student of the Old Testament learns about. He was a silver scroll that has this crazy ancient blessing in it that dates all the way back to close to the beginning of the Bible and they found it. Somebody just dug it up. I mean, it was small enough. I don't think I went clink on the end of his shovel, but the crazy thing is my buddy John was just standing there. He watched it get found. Can you imagine getting to be around for something that important? That's significant. To just see the first batch of dirt slide off of that thing as it sees the light of day for the first time in thousands of years. That kind of business continues to capture my imagination and part of the way that we can composite back together a sense of what the Persian world that Queen Esther was living in was like is to go and look at all the cool stuff that has been dug up or left behind and well preserved in very public ways by the Persians from 2500 years ago. Yesterday we talked about the Cyrus cylinder. Cyrus is the founder of the Persian empire. He conquered Babylon in 539 and then he was like, you know what? We need some pamphlets here because people are not totally feeling the Cyrus thing and Cyrus wants them to feel the Cyrus thing. So he whips up this script about who he is and where he's from and how much he likes Marduk and Babylon and how everything's going to be fine. And he probably circulated it around there quite a bit. Well we have one of those which is really cool for giving us insight to what he's about and we also get cool things like that for his successors Darius and Darius's son Xerxes of course is who is commonly held out or thought to be the king of the book of Esther. Let's put a hold on Cyrus's successor Darius for a minute and skip forward to Xerxes because he's got a couple of cool ones. One, we know he was working on this citadel in Sousa at the time that the book of Esther is held out as being written. In fact it even specifies that this is all happening in the citadel of Sousa. Wow, we found an inscription from him and by we I don't mean me at all. Other people completely separate from me. I had nothing to do with it. Found it and then they posted it on the internet and I was able to look at it and what this inscription says is that Darius started this work on this capital in Sousa. We have other evidence that suggests that Darius's preferred capital of the many capitals the Persians had was indeed Sousa and he died before he could finish the work. So Xerxes who was very keen to honor his father at every turn, he finished up that work and so when we get into the book of Esther and we're hearing about like the city gates and some of the architecture of the palace complex and all of that, well that is substantiated by a chunk of rock we got out of the ground that says, hey, I'm Xerxes. This is Sousa. My dad started on this. I finished it up here, the different building projects that I wrapped up here and I'm really proud of it and it's really neat. It's a lot of paraphrasing but that's the gist. Further, those Greek historians I was talking about a couple of days ago, most notably Herodotus, they tell us that Xerxes was very proud of his cosmopolitan army that was made up of all of these ethnic warriors from all the different parts of the world and this is a really cool thing about Xerxes. Just from a pure entertainment perspective, Xerxes wanted his armies to communicate to anybody who encountered them that Xerxes was ruler of the world and that all of these different people who looked really different and fought really different were all a part of his very diverse army. He viewed it as a huge flex and so there's this great big panel that shows all of these different warriors right in a row and smart people have been able to go back and look at it and figure out exactly who each one of those warriors represents. But you know how in modern combat, everybody's got to wear the digital camouflage and you all get a gun that looks like that and that's your helmet, then there's a little bit of variety but it's just so very, very uniform. Well, that's very different than what we're getting back here. There's more like a fantasy novel or Star Wars or something like that where if somebody shows up and they're a Jedi warrior or they're going to wear their robe and they're going to have their lightsaber and no armor but if they're from Mandalore, they're going to wear that cool helmet and they're going to have their jetpack and if they're a wookie, they're going to wear that weird sash thing and a crossbow and otherwise I guess they're just naked. I never really thought about that before. But I guess even that corresponds here, the naked thing that is because however these warriors from all around the world fought, that's how Xerxes wanted them in his army. He'll figure out a way to use the Axemen of the great Northeast. He'll figure out a way to use the Spearmen. He'll figure out a way to use the Burly Marines of the Sea people of the Greeks. And so we've got this really cool inscription that gives us a visual representation of what Darius and especially Xerxes' vision for his world, his empire and his army was all about. Okay, but the granddaddy of them all in terms of leaving something for us to look at in a hard physical form is Darius the Great. Darius carved an elaborate fascinating tomb and the inscriptions around this gigantic tomb that's just cut out of the side of a mountain. Give us a whole bunch of ideas about his virtues and what it looked like to be a king the right way. It looks like he's sending messages forward to future kings with that. But even more prominent than his amazing tomb and I think they say that Xerxes had one cut right next to his dad and that he would have been buried in there for the time. But even cooler than that tomb is this grand inscription on this mountain named Behiston. And when I say grandd we're talking like ancient to Egypt, Mount Rushmore. We're talking gigantic stone carving here. What happened is that Darius was not descended from Cyrus. Cyrus found the empire and then some stuff happens with Cyrus's kids that we'll get into later and somehow out of all of that Darius emerges. A lot of people call him Darius. I just can't bring myself to do it. I think both of them get the point across. I think I'm just going to stick with Darius. He emerges from this era of chaos after the life of Cyrus and claims that he has liberated the throne from an imposter, a liar who tried to steal Persia for himself. And Darius points backwards to say that he is an achaemenid, that is he is descended from a guy by that name and that therefore he's distantly related to Cyrus as well. And it's his language, Darius's language that is used to describe the dynasty that looking backwards includes Cyrus and looking forward includes Xerxes, art as Xerxes and all the way down the line until the eventual defeat of this line by Alexander the Great. Well not everybody took Darius at his word. Some people looked at him and were like, you are a new surper. You're the one who's the fraud and the imposter. Isn't it convenient that you were standing right there to pick up the crown when it fell to the ground? No, we don't believe this. And there were a lot of rebellions and uprisings in the early years of Darius's reign, which is about 40 years before the events were reading about in Esther. Darius had to go quell and quiet all of that stuff. And it looks like he felt that he needed to record for all of time that he was the legitimate king and that he was the one who was brave enough to go and shut down this lie that this imposter was proliferating that had tried to steal the throne from Cyrus and his good family. So let's think about this. What would you do if you were in his spot? You had all the resources in the world, but you wanted people for thousands of years to know the truth about who you are and where you came from and that you were the legitimate king and the establishment of a dynasty. Well, I don't know. I mean, you can't just type that. I mean, what if there's an EMP, an electronic won't work. Can't put it on paper. That breaks down. Stone tablets are small. Those could get lost. Maybe you could copy it a jillion times, but there's no guarantee that would make it forward in history. What he decides to do is I referenced it a minute ago. He goes to a giant carving on a mountain way up high that explains the whole story. And so he gives us this wonderful gift of laying out everything about how he became king in three different languages. So everybody would know what it meant. There are warnings on this gigantic inscription about what happens to anybody who might ever mess with it. And then he had the same people who carved it, chiseled the whole face of this giant mountain that's like 11,000 feet tall. He had him chiseled the whole thing flat. So you couldn't ever really climb up it or climb down it to vandalize it. And it worked. It's still there. If you go to Iran, which I haven't had the opportunity to do, you can go to Mount Beast and you can see this carving that was there. You can't make out what it says with the naked eye from down below. I mean, I can't make out what it says period. I don't know. Those languages are. But now there are ways you can get up there and get a closer look at it. And I think it's just one of the most amazing wonders of the world. And I'm so grateful for Darius's insecurity that prompted him to send this message forward into time so we could know more about this moment in history. There are other artifacts and engravings and so forth that might come up as we go along as well. But especially remember that last one that carving it's going to come up a lot as we talk about Xerxes and his family. And as we talk about Persia as we work on the book of Esther. All right. Just like a dutiful eighth grader putting together a proper paper. We've gathered our sources and now next time around, I think we can get into the actual story of how all of this stuff sets up that gets us to the moment that is in view in the book of Esther. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon."
