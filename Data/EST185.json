Some moment, maybe multiple moments in the history of our lives that we look back on. And when we tell the story, when we reevaluate it for ourselves, we think, that was a spot. That's where things were going to get decided one way or another. That was the moment where if I could get through that, it was going to lay the foundation for everything that was to come, but I had to survive that thing. Maybe it was getting sick. Maybe it was a job thing. Maybe it was a relationship fallout. Maybe it was an accident. I have no clue, but I think we all can relate to that pinch point in life, that pivotal moment where stuff is not coming easy and you got to grind really hard to get through it. But then whatever good stuff happens on the other side, you point right back to that. In the big, grand historical sense, I think that's a really good way to think about the book of Esther in our final day of considering this book that we've been talking about now for months. We've spent a ton of time thinking about the theological themes and the literary themes. We had a long conversation about that a couple of days ago. We've spent a bunch of time talking about extra biblical history and where Esther fits into other narratives about other people groups and other things that were going on. We've even spent time considering some of the stuff that other people have done as they've riffed and memed on Esther with fan fiction and legends through the years. But in this last conversation we have about this book together, I want to think about the significance of Esther to the whole big grand narrative picture. Here's what I mean. The Bible starts out with nothing being broken and then very quickly things get broken and then very quickly we get the minute 17 moment of the Bible, the moment where you figure out what the plot is going to be and what the trajectory of the characters is going to be and what we discover is that rather than washing his hands of it and using his power to make stuff out of nothing and start all over and make a new reality, one that maybe would go better, we learn that God instead has decided to redeem the brokenness of this reality as we know it, that his redemptive work over time with humankind is going to bring glory to him and that's the redemptive plan and the glory of God that's going to be the big story. And we learn very quickly that it's not going to be about one individual, one particular hero, there'll be some big names along the way. It's not even going to be exclusively about one people group though we're mostly going to see God's character and his plan play out through the relationship he has, a communicative, close covenant relationship with one particular group of people, the Hebrews, the descendants of Abraham, the Jews, the Israelites. And so we track through this huge chunk of the beginning of the Bible which is the narrative chunk of the Old Testament with Esther being effectively the last narrative book of the Old Testament and we see a bunch of close calls. They're all kinds of moments where it looks like God's chosen people are just going to be wiped out and forgotten to history like the vast majority of people groups from the ancient world. We don't know who they were, they just went away. Have you ever think about that? Most of the people groups we've never even heard of. We don't know their language, we don't know where they went. They got absorbed, assimilated, enslaved, famine, they just died off. We don't even know what their fate was, they're gone. And there are several moments throughout the Old Testament where it looks like this people group to whom God has hitched the promises of his grand redemptive plan for all of history. There are several times it looks like things might fall through with the Egyptian army bearing down on them in the desert and their backs up against the sea wandering around in the desert facing the threats of that environment. Trying to find a place to settle down and set up shop in the age when nomadism no longer worked and you really needed to put down roots or vanish to history and having to fight all kinds of people in the realm of Canaan. And then you talk about the interaction with the parade of foreign powers that come and go with the big empires of the ancient Near East. It seems like the Jewish people, the Israelites find themselves at odds with people left and right. And on top of finding themselves at odds with the early Hittites and the Assyrians and the Egyptians and a bunch of smaller little kingdoms and city-states from around them and the Philistines and eventually the Babylonians and eventually the Persians that we'll talk more about in just a minute, they also find themselves at odds with each other. They can't keep their kingdom together for more than really three generations of leaders and from there on out they split. Ten of the tribes go north into the northern kingdom. Two of the tribes go south into the southern kingdom of Judah and they're no good kings up north and there are only a few down south and it's a really rough ride and there are several moments of violence and war and famine and other threats to the people but they keep squeaking by. And as we've discussed a ton, things look particularly horrible in the early 500s BC when Nebuchadnezzar conquers and destroys Jerusalem and the temple but then there's a ray of light when Cyrus the Great conquers the Babylonians and the Persians seem a little bit more disposed to be charitable to the Jewish people but even that is short lived and still within the reign of Cyrus there is opposition and then within the reign of Darius there is opposition but nothing like what we see during the reign of Xerxes and the story we've just been looking at. We've seen a bunch of threats. Maybe the biggest up till this point was that moment of conflict with their backs against the sea during the Exodus but you got to go back at least that far to find a threat. This complete, this existential, this imminent, I mean this one is straight up scheduled on a calendar as what you get in the pages of Esther. Heyman won the day. He got the upper hand. He outmaneuvered his enemies and he got ahold of the king's ring and the king's permission to make it not just a matter of insurrection or opportunism to kill the Jews but to make it a matter of law. The Jews couldn't win unless they could I guess defeat all of Persia and that wasn't going to happen. But is at stake then in the middle of the book of Esther is first of all the survival of an entire people group because all of the Jews are dang near all of the Jews with maybe just a few exceptions somewhere in the far reaches of Greece or maybe down into what we would call modern day Ethiopia with just a few exceptions. All the centers of population of Jewish people were within the boundaries of the Persian Empire during the reign of Xerxes. The seed it goes out and it gets followed through on Judaism is done. The Jews are done and they become a forgotten people group who were just one of the many carvings of people in elaborate costumes on the wall of some Persian relief that we don't understand and scratch our heads at when we see it in the British Museum. It was that close for this people group. But beyond that the redemptive plan remember is tethered to this people group. If they fail here if for such a time as this if deliverance does not come from another place the redemptive plan is off the rails. There is no shoot that's coming out of the stump of Jesse. There is no ray of light or hope. There is no Nebuchadnezzar punish the people of Judah but he took the king captive and let him eat at his table. There's no ray of hope no glimmer of that if Haman's order is seen through on that fateful day. So who's going to rise up and do something about it? Well apparently a guy who sits around by the gate of the city and listens to gossip and a secret Jew queen who hasn't admitted to anyone that she's actually Jewish and resides in the court of and shares a bed with one of the most unpredictable, volatile, strange, emotionally vulnerable prone to violence kings in the history of the empire. And yet by the providence of God they get it done. As the text presents it, it's not just the fate of one people group that is hanging in the balance here though that's a really big deal. It is also the fate of the entire redemptive plan as the text presents it that is hanging in the balance here. And in this moment the corresponds to that moment in your life or my life that seems like the most vulnerable, the most fragile, the most in danger, in jeopardy moment of our lives. And just get through that there might be great things on the other side. In this moment that corresponds to that experience that you and I have probably all had, God shows up and deliverance comes without him ever even being mentioned. That is how the story is to be understood and that is how the story has been understood for 2500 years. It is meant to serve to the reader as a beautiful reminder of God's providence over all of history. It's meant to serve as a reminder to the reader who might feel like their moment in time is totally out of control, totally off the rails. Insane people are running everything. Culture is out of control. Everything has gone crazy and upside down and violent and insane. It's meant to remind people who live in moments like that that the same God who was in control even when not mentioned during a time as crazy as the one depicted in the book of Esther, that God is still in control of history even now during the crazy times in which we might find ourselves. I told you at the beginning that it was a beautiful story with serious implications. And well, I hope that you are coming away from this time that we spent together learning about it, feeling the same way because I'm more convinced of that than ever. Also, I'm not done with this thread and I want to keep pulling on it and I want to see what the come through the fire and come out the other side moment looks like. And that's why we're moving on to Nehemiah next because effectively it really is the sequel to this story. And we're going to find out what God's chosen people are held out as having done with the opportunity that was bought for them by the shrewdness of Mordecai, the cleverness and the social cunning and courage of Esther and the providence of God. And so we'll check that out. Starting with the next series, season four of the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, which is on Nehemiah and that is coming up next. I would be honored if you would show up for that and do Nehemiah with me. I can't wait to learn about it. I don't write it all in advance. I don't know where everything is going. I'm learning in real time with you. I'm not at all ashamed to admit that. And once more, I would like to push my luck just a little bit further and not only invite you to come and hang out with me while we every day chip away at the book of Nehemiah. I'd also be grateful if you'd consider if there's somebody you might be able to invite to come with us as well. There's no greater honor than for you to vouch for me for this and to invite somebody else to be a part of it. And so thanks in advance for even considering it and no hard feelings and it ain't weird if you decide not to. Either way, my friends, thank you for doing this with me. I had a blast. I learned so much along the way and that is because of you. Your interest in this is what bought me the time and the will to get to dig into it. I'm forever grateful to you for this chapter of my life that corresponds with our time together in Esther. And I've said it like three times, so I'll say it again. I'm really excited to unwrap and get into the next chapter in my life, which is going to correspond to hanging out with you as we discuss the book of Nehemiah. All right. I think that's plenty for now. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
