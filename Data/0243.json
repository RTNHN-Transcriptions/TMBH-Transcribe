KYLE?", "episode_num": "0243", "pub_date": "Wed, 14 Oct 2020 05:21:52 +0000", "duration": "10:58", "subtitle": "Matthew 11:11", "url": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/thetenminutebiblehourpodcast/0243.mp3"}, "transcription_data": {"text": " In Matthew 11, 11, Jesus says, I tell you the truth, among those born of women, there is not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist. Then Kyle stood up in the back and shouted, I wasn't born of a woman. I was from my mother's womb untimely ripped. And then the heavens parted and the angels attended to Kyle. And Jesus was super embarrassed. I joke that is not what the Bible says at all. I didn't even look at a joke book for that. I just thought of it in my head. It's funny because it includes a hip cultural reference. Oh. All right, at some point in life, every single one of us have had somebody else go to bat for us that is vouch for us. And at some point in life, probably all of us have vouched for somebody else. And the vouch has a very simple, very clear anatomy. You're taking your credibility that you've earned with people over time. And you are transferring some of that to another person who maybe has their credibility wobbling a little bit, but you definitely believe in them. And you think they belong in the game, they belong at the table, you know, whatever the scenario might be. And in Matthew chapter 11, Jesus is vouching for his cousin John. It sounds almost like a mafia movie, but he's going to bat for him. And what he's saying, according to the age old rule of the vouch is, hey, he's good for it. And if you're not sure if he's good for it, well, I'm good for it. And I'm saying he will be good for it. You kind of go big. Like, no, he's great. He's wonderful. You can count on him totally. But in Matthew chapter 11, Jesus does something really weird with his vouch. He says all of this great stuff about John that goes like this. What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you. And more than a prophet, this is the one about whom it is written. I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you. Jesus is likening John to the forerunner that was predicted in the Old Testament, in the book of Isaiah, and again, in the book of Malachi, who is supposed to come before the king who will reign forever. The chosen king of the eternal kingdom. This is a very important role in the minds of the original audience, or like just a very important role, period. So you're smart. Those are some pretty grand ovation. Jesus is transferring a whole lot of credibility here, heaping praise on John, but then the vouch takes a weird turn in verse 11. I tell you the truth. Among those born of women, there is not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist, and you'd think that would be it, but it's not it. He goes on to say, yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he, greater than John. You can't do that. Everybody knows the rules of vouch. It's like triple stamping a double stamp. That's not how vouch works. But then after you and I get past the initial shock of the vouch going sideways, maybe we step back and we think about a theme that you and I have discussed earlier, that we decided we were going to have our antenna out for as we read through Matthew. And that is this theme of Jesus valuing this exact moment in redemptive history very highly. So you got the Mary and Martha thing where one is like, I'm going to make some stuff. And the other one's like, I'm going to hang out with Jesus. And Jesus is like the one that wants to hang out with me. She's the one who gets it. You got the other lady who's like, here's a whole bunch of perfume in my hair and I'm going to cry in a minute. And I'll annoy you. And some of the fancy people are like, ah, well, I think that we could have found a better way to use that expensive perfume. But Jesus affirms her. And he's like, oh, no, she gets it. She understands the significance of what's going on here. And even think about the call of the disciples. These are people who had jobs and responsibilities and probably let some people down and drop to the ball when they quit their jobs to go with Jesus. But Jesus isn't worried about that. He seems to tacitly affirm them as having made the right call in the moment, because this moment is special. The God in the flesh is here. The kingdom is arriving is manifesting right now. And if we step back and look big picture at how excited Jesus is about this moment and how enthusiastic Jesus is to affirm the people who understand the bigness of the moment and the bigness of who they're hanging out with, then we see a little bit more why Jesus would say that the person who is even the least, the bottom rung in the kingdom, is still more blessed than even the awesomest rock star theological historical legend of the old system before that kingdom began to manifest. The framed another way, Jesus is making a division here between everything that happened before and everything that's happening right now. Before you have an ethnic religion that was always intended for more people and it was predicated on a handful of covenants that deals that you and I have talked about. One with Abraham where the deal is, hey, you don't have to do anything. I just picked you and you're going to be a great nation and you're going to be blessed and you're going to be a blessing to all the nations. Oh, okay, well, we'll just see where his descendants go. And then you have a very conditional deal that God makes with Moses that is, hey, I'm going to be your God. You all are going to be my people. And if you obey me, I'm going to bless you and everybody will know that I'm your God and you're my people. And if you disobey me, I'm going to punish you. And also everyone will then know that I'm your God and that you are my people. And then he makes a deal with David where he says, no matter how dumb you are or how destructive your behavior is, I'm still going to create an eternal throne, an eternal kingdom, and your descendant one day is going to sit on that and reign forever. These are the old deals, the context of thought, the context of the arrangement between God and his people that are rattling around in the heads of people. They stand here and watch this whole little exchange about John the Baptist go down. And so what Jesus again is doing is drawing a distinction between that old stuff that is all pointing toward and culminating in this moment with Jesus, the paparata of the Old Testament and the papa of the New Testament with Jesus. These are different things, but there's continuity between them. The one points to the other. The one, the first one is fulfilled in who Jesus is and what he's doing, just like we read in Matthew 5 17 and like we keep going back to. Therefore, and this is the big idea. If all of that old stuff is pointing toward this culminating, redemptive event that is the arrival of God and the flesh, the arrival of the Messiah, the beginning of the kingdom, and John was the last guy of all the prophets, of all the old part of the story saying, okay, we're finally to the end of the old part of the story. And now the kingdom thing is about to happen. And right there is the guy who's going to do it. Behold, the Lamb of God who takes the way the sins of the world is Jesus right there. He's the one who sandals, I am unfit to not fit to untie. He's the one who's got the winnowing fork. He is the one who is going to baptize with fire in the spirit. If John the Baptist is the last dude in all of the old part of the story who hands off the baton to the new or the culminating part of the story, and if John the Baptist is then the last of the prophets, the last of that deal or arrangement before we get into the culmination and completion of those deals in Jesus, then well, he's a pretty big deal, but he still represents a reality before the kingdom. And I think what Jesus is saying here is that even someone with as prominent a role as John had in the old ground rules, the old part of things, that person still pales in comparison to even the least significant person in the actual kingdom that is unfolding right now before your eyes. As you are standing here listening to me, Jesus tell you all about John the Baptist and myself. What he's saying is even the highest peak in the old part of the story that points toward the kingdom doesn't come anywhere close in altitude to the very basement of the actual kingdom. If you are in the kingdom, you are experiencing the beginnings of the fullness of what God is about and what his reign is about and what his character is about and what it looks like when his values are in full force and fully visible. And of all the time that is passed throughout history, the moment where that has been most visible is when the king was actually there in one part of the world for just a few years, which is again why Jesus is always so enthusiastic about the people who understand the significance of the moment that they were living in with him in the physical actual presence of the king. So the most obvious reason that the least in this new kingdom are greater than the most prominent in the old thing that was going on is proximity to Jesus, proximity to the advent of this kingdom. But beyond that, it seems like it's also a matter of your role, what you're described as. Remember, all that language in the Sermon on the Mount goes way beyond you are a person who is in, you are a person who was bad, but now is viewed as acceptable. And it goes past that into, no, you are a son, a daughter, an heir to the kingdom, you are a participant in the kingdom and ambassador of the kingdom, you are salt, you are light, you have a role in this thing, you're vested and you have ownership. And it seems like that's different than the old set of ground rules because now people are given access to membership in the kingdom by the righteousness of Jesus. All of your flawed screwed up in this is made right as Jesus imparts upon the incoming kingdom citizen, his righteousness. So then it gives you a standing that you couldn't have that even John the Baptist who was awesome could not have under the old set of ground rules. In the era leading up to the age of the kingdom, the era that culminates with John the Baptist, the best you can do is go from guilty to not guilty because you did sacrifices and now the guilt is on an animal or something. But in the age of the kingdom, you're going from a position of guilty and outside of the kingdom in broken relationship with the king to a position of again, son, daughter, heir, ambassador, agent, vestedness in this kingdom. Thus again, even the least under these new set of kingdom ground rules are in a far greater position, have far greater standing than even the greatest under the old set of ground rules. And if that's a lot to take in and a little overwhelming, that is all right. This is an idea that we will continue to unpack and that will continue to become more clear as we work through the rest of the book of Matthew. We'll keep chipping away at it tomorrow. I'm Matt.
