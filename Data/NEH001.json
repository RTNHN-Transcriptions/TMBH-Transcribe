This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and I'm super excited because today is... It's a new day. It's a new series. We're getting started on the book of Nehemiah today. I guess you could say that this is the beginning of season four of this podcast. Season one, we went all the way through the book of Matthew. That took a minute, but I learned so much stuff and had so much fun. In season two, we went through each book of the Bible, one book per day, just real quick, until we were done. Also, I learned a ton of stuff. I feel like I came out of that understanding how the whole Bible hangs together better than I've ever understood it before. Then we just finished up season three, which was on the book of Esther, which is set in ancient Persia about 450, 500 years before the time of Jesus with big, bold, loud, colorful characters and passion and violence and high stakes. Dang it, I did that pun again on accident. There are literal physical high stakes in the book of Esther. For those of you who haven't read it or weren't here for that, like literal, actually, like for impaling people and stuff. I keep saying that and I really don't even mean to do that pun, but it just keeps happening and it just bit me in the butt again. There you go. There are high stakes, literally, and figuratively. It's a great book in a fascinating moment in the history of the world. I'm excited about Nehemiah because it allows us to stay in that world of Persia. I'm also excited about Nehemiah because this is the last narrative book of the Old Testament and some good things happen in it. The Old Testament is rough. You say it's an up and down story, but it's a lot of down. A lot goes wrong. God's people in that story have a really rough go of it. It's easy to feel like at points as you read through the historical books of the Old Testament, like you're just banging your head against the wall. Same stuff, same stuff, same stuff. Nehemiah leaves it on a little different note, not a perfect note, but it certainly feels different than a lot of the rest of the Old Testament. It's got really big implications for how the world is right now, how the world was at the time of Jesus and surprisingly large amount of implications for personal stuff about life and growth and relationships and leadership and things like that. I try not to overextend myself when I get into that kind of stuff in the Bible unless it's really overt, but there's some of it that you just can't miss in the book of Nehemiah about heroism and leadership and courage and failure and how to come back from that and self-doubt and humility. There's just a bunch of surprisingly applicable things in this book that is really first and foremost about a guy who is the cut bearer to the king of the world, King Artaxerxes of Persia, who hears that his people's hometown, capital city of Jerusalem is vulnerable and that it's in hard times and that it's in jeopardy and he understands that this is more than just a town being on hard times economically or something. He understands that there's something much more significant to that about the fate of the whole world and the fate of the whole redemptive plan of God and everything. And so he takes big, bold, dangerous action to go and do something about it, not tweet about it, not gripe about it, not forward memes about it, not impotently complain at Applebee's over Margaritas. He actually gets off his butt and he goes and does something brave and dangerous and big that he's going to get ridiculed for, man in the arena, all of that kind of stuff. And he's flawed. The execution isn't perfect, but he does something and I find this book to be inspiring and compelling. And so I suppose I need to say welcome to a few people here on the front end. First of all, if this is your first time ever here, welcome. You are awesome. Thank you for checking this thing out. Here's a couple reasons why I think you're awesome. One, you know how the internet works and you are smart. So you can go and scroll through this and see that there are 11 D bajillion episodes of this podcast already. I mean, I don't know how you're wired psychologically, but for me, if I see something like that, I feel like I'm on the outside looking in and like it's going to be weird for me to show up to the party so late, but it's not like that. So one, I want to compliment your bravery for jumping into something that's pretty established. You picked a really good place to jump in, by the way, because we kind of start fresh every time. Two, I also want to compliment you on the front end for being open to the idea of kind of committing to something that might take a minute because sometimes things that are really meaningful and really push us in the places where we really grow do take a minute. Thank you for being here. If it's your first time and being willing to check it out further, though, I know that there are a bunch of you who are here for the first time because yeah, you saw something I said on the internet, like somehow your algorithm crossed paths with my algorithm in the night and you're like, Oh, hey. Yeah, I've kind of been in the market for doing some kind of Bible thing every day. So yeah, you just saw it somewhere on the internet. Awesome. That's a great reason to be here. I know that there are a bunch of you here right now, though, who are talking together with me who are here because somebody you care about has enjoyed this podcast in the past and they've been asking you to try it out and you are kind and you are empathetic and you are here because you respect them and you care about them. That is awesome of you. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me. You're here on a vouch. So that's not lost on me. I don't take that lightly. I am grateful to your friend or your loved one who asked you to come check it out. And I'm grateful to you for being so kind and empathetic to do so further. I know there are a whole bunch of you here who are in completely different places in life as it pertains to the big questions about life, death, God, existence, social stuff, relationships, the world, all of that. I know that there are a bunch of you who are here who would say, yeah, I mean, my foundation on the whole faith thing is pretty solid. I've been in for a long time. I care about this kind of stuff. I want to invest in it deeply all the time. So this podcast is part of how I do that. I think there's a God behind the Bible. And I think he's the one true God, the maker of all things. And every minute I spend thinking about the Bible is a minute that is incredibly valuable and time well spent. I love that so much of the feedback I get from so many of you is coming from that point, that motivator for curiosity. But I know that there are others of you here who like me got a little dinged up along the way. Maybe you were around God and the Bible and Christianity and church and all that kind of stuff when you were younger and then stuff got weird, something hurt along the way. There's a weird transition that happened in the age of church somewhere in the early 2000s, really 2010 and the internet happened. The world got smaller social media happen. I mean, a lot happened in there and it was clumsy for everybody on everything. Some of that manifested in church hurt or doubt. I think surely there's a whole bunch of you who somewhere along the way took a few shots, getting a little dinged up in terms of the faith thing. And you're still here because you think there's something to it. Like I think there's something to it. I think for me, one of the real values of doing this together with you is that we get to use our own words and our own eyes and our own ears and we get to look at this thing at our own pace with no institutional thing breathing down our neck. We've got to get all of this figured out by the end of the semester to get a good grade or well, we've got to get it done by 1215 because church is over then and people got to get home and get the roast out of the oven. It's nothing like that. We can take as long as we want and we can just chase down everything that we want and try to go after every bit of curiosity that percolates for me. That's a huge reason that I want to do this and be around it because it's a really meaningful way to engage with the text. It opens up a lot of opportunities for me. And I know that some of you are in the same boat. I know that others of you are in a place where you don't believe in God, but you see the Bible as being really compelling and interesting. And maybe you just have somebody in your life who's really into it and you're hyper empathetic and you want to understand this thing that informs their values and their rhythms and how they think all the better. And I have huge admiration for those of you who I've heard from who are wired that way, who are here for that reason. That is a remarkable ability to think outside of yourself that would prompt you in that direction. Still, I know there are others of you who suspect that there is something much bigger to the universe and life than the fully naturalistic explanation that has been fashionable for the last 75 to 100 years, particularly the last 20 years. You want to go and quietly feel that out and you want to give it a fair shake and you want to look close at it with your own eyes and think about it for yourself. I resonate with that curiosity. I could go on and on about the journey of faith, the process of faith and what that has looked like in the lives of so many people I've talked to, what that looks like in my own life. But the bottom line is I'm so grateful you're here. I'm so grateful that we don't have to be identical to hang out together. I love that this is a weird group of people. You and me hanging out here working this thing through. I love that we will ultimately not all land at exactly the same set of conclusions. I love that I feel no pressure here to try to make you me or see everything about the world exactly as I do. It's an internet man. We don't think it doesn't work. It isn't how things are here. So the pressure is off. The upside I think is huge and tomorrow we're going to start getting into the nuts and bolts of what exactly is going on in this book. And I think it's going to be a blast. Thank you so much for being here and for hanging out with me and more Nehemiah. Manana. All right. I'm Matt. This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
