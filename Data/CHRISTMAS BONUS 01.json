I'm Jeff, Matt's on vacation and I have a cold, but that's okay. We took an old message of Matt's, cut it up into five 10 minute sections, give or take, and that's all I have for you this week. We'll be back with Nehemiah to kick off the new year next Monday. Merry Christmas everybody. The Old Testament is the first half of the Bible and in it God deals primarily with the Jewish people and He deals with the Jewish people primarily through covenants or deals that He makes with them. There are three big ones that we've talked about. One that He made with Abraham where He said, Abraham, I'm going to make out of you a great nation and I'm going to bless all the nations through you. What I'm going to need you to do in order for me to hold at my end of the bargain is nothing. It's an unconditional promise. I'm going to redeem and it just so happens that I picked you Abraham. There's another promise that gets made to Moses. We're maybe 800 years down the road from the time of Abraham and as Moses and the descendants of Abraham, the Hebrew people are leaving their time in Egypt. God makes a deal with Moses and He says, I'm going to give you a land and I'm going to make you people. And if you obey me and my commands and keep the covenant we've made, I'm going to bless you. And if you don't, I'm going to punish you. Either way, all the nations are going to know that I'm the true God and that you're my people based on your behavior and how I respond to it one way or the other. So conditional deal. And then we get to a place about 400 years after that where Israel has a kingdom and a king in David, the great king of all time for the Jewish people. And David says, I want to build you a special temple God. And God says, cool, thanks for wanting to do that. I'm actually going to have your kid do that later. Instead of building me a temple, I want to build with you a covenant. And God makes a covenant with David saying that from the line of David would come a great king, an everlasting king who would establish this great and perfect and complete kingdom. And what David was going to need to do to make that happen was nothing. So once again, it was an unconditional covenant. We spent a lot of time looking at how the rest of the Old Testament fits into those promises that God made to people and how all of that stuff adds up. And then we got to Matthew, oh, back in May. Our first look at Matthew is right where Matthew opens the book. He starts with a whole long list of names that seems like the boringest thing ever until you take the four months that we took before to understand who all these people are. And then after looking at the Old Testament and understanding the promises of God and how all of the Old Testament points toward Jesus and this ultimate redemptive thing that couldn't be achieved through human means, all of a sudden all the names on that list matter. And you start to realize, oh, each story that's behind each of these Old Testament character names listed out by Matthew as the forebearers of Jesus, every one of those comes with a story that is a reminder and an affirmation of these covenants and a reminder that all of this is going to culminate in something. And every one of those stories suddenly points to Jesus. The week after that, we looked at the birth narrative, which puts greater emphasis on Joseph and his response to what was going on with Mary than does the gospel of Luke. But it's a brief and in the birth narrative that we looked at last time around, it's pretty much why I was a baby, I was born, it was cool. Joseph did what he was supposed to do and Mary did what she was supposed to do and it was exactly as it was supposed to be. And that's kind of it. Now, you'll notice that when we get to Christmastime, we always hang around in Luke because Luke gives us all kinds of details and emotion to it. But Matthew seems more interested in establishing one thing and one thing only. The child is legitimate, both as the son of God and the son of Mary and Joseph, but the child is legitimate as king. If you want to understand Matthew, if you want to understand the whole thrust of the Old Testament moving into the New Testament, that word is crucial to your understanding. But in the New Testament, Matthew is going to pound the point that Jesus is that fulfillment, promise to David, that Jesus is this descendant of David who is going to be the great king, who is going to bring about all of the redemptive things and all of the blessings of God to fix what's wrong with the world and what's wrong with people that we're talked about in the Old Testament. That took longer than a minute, but you're all are still here. So gotcha. In chapter two, we get into a story that always comes up at Christmas time but has next to nothing to do with Christmas. It's just one of those things where it neatly lumps together in the music fits so we do it. But as we talk about this today, I'm going to ask you to not think Christmas-y thoughts and try to come at this with fresh eyes. And to help you do that, I'm going to use an opening illustration that I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever use in our Christmas Eve service. Who saw Mad Max Fury Road? I feel like we're off to a great start because for you, you raised your hands. You don't need to have seen it in order for this to work. Thank you, Jan. You brought it up to five. Okay. Some of you are new, so I got to do the disclaimer thing. I am in no way recommending that you go and watch this movie, especially with your children. I understand that it has some objectionable content and violence. I understand that some of the language could be offensive to some people. No, no, no, no. I'm like, you get it. I loved it. To me, this is one of those movies that is a sneaky Christian movie. The themes are so thick with the same stuff that I'm into and that I come across in the Bible. In this story, you've got a post-apocalyptic, you washed out, sun-drenched desert, everything's ruined version of Australia, which is way different than how Australia actually is. In this reality, petrol, fuel, gasoline, oil, this is the main currency that everybody wants. There's no government, there's no order, there's no morality. Everything is broken. This movie opens with this post-apocalyptic, futuristic warlord guy. He's got this kind of Darth Vader mask and he's pure evil. You can tell he's pure evil by how he treats people in close relationship, but also by how he treats the people who are his underlings. He's got him under his thumb because he controls water. Rather than thoughtfully distributing water in such a way that would elevate everyone and make things better, he's found a way to harness the mess that is this burnout post-apocalyptic world to give himself power. So he distributes water in this sloppy fashion that doesn't actually help anybody. He wants people to worship him as Emperor, King, maybe even a God. There's a God cult that is developed around this bad guy character and he's even named himself Immortan Joe, Immortal. Wow, he's bad. Well, along comes this female character with a robot arm, which I thought made her cooler. And she feels like this whole thing is broken and she has a plan for how to do something to break up the whole system, to disrupt this guy's power by taking down this entire corrupt, ugly, cult tribal thing that he's got going. And so without ruining the movie, she carries out her plan and of course Immortan Joe freaks out. And the rest of the movie is this elaborate hour and a half, all practical effects chase across Australia blowing things up. It's fantastic. It's super fun. But what's so interesting to me is that rather than Immortan Joe saying, I've still got all my money, I've still got all my stuff, yeah, I don't care, whatever, go, he's smart and he understands that what she's effectively doing is undermining the whole system with her actions. And so he cannot let it go unpunished. And so he burns unbelievable amounts of gasoline and burns through the lives of his followers to go and chase her and her people down in a very not cost efficient pursuit. Well, Immortan Joe is a lot like Herod who we're going to read about in Matthew chapter two. Here's a guy who had very cleverly found a way to make the best of a very ugly situation so that he came out on top, but his power was dependent on this ugly situation continuing. And if anybody did anything to redeem or improve the ugly situation, there would be no place for a character like Herod in that. So even though he's regarded historically, especially in his later years as a mad man, we see him acting rather sanely in Matthew chapter two as he rightly identifies the threat that this baby Jesus, this child Jesus poses and we see him hatch an elaborate plan to get rid of Jesus so that he can keep this weird power structure that he's established. I want you to know what I'm talking about. So let's read the thing together. Matthew chapter two, I'm going to go verses one through twelve. Let's read the whole thing. It says, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, where is the one who's been born king of the Jews? We saw a star in the east and have come to worship him. King Herod heard this, he was disturbed and all Jerusalem with him. When he called together all the peoples, chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born. In Bethlehem in Judea, they replied, this is what the prophets written, but you, Bethlehem and the land of Judah are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel. Then Herod called them as I secretly and found out from them the exact time the start appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, said I may too, may go and worship him. After they had heard the king, they went on their way and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and incense and mer and having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.",
