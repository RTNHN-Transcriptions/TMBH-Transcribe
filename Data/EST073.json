while back i was on a trip with a couple of my friends and are the road trip buddy adventure journey took us through southern california we went to hollywood then we were there walking up and down i guess it's called hollywood boulevard is that the name of the place for the apple the stars let's call it hollywood boulevard we're in the hollywood place stars and spider-man batman all of the places pretty goofy scene and then a guy walks up to us and strikes up a conversation it's like hey i work for this particular talk show you guys look like the kind of people that we want to have in our studio audience for that we're shooting here in x amount of time we pay a little bit of money you want to be on the show we're like yeah heck yeah so we drove over there to one of the studios i think it was fox but i don't remember for sure and we drove in past a bunch of places where they were filming things that was pretty cool and we got to the building the studio where they were filming this particular show we went in and kind of casually did a little meet and greet with the hosts one of them was real cool another one was really not cool and then we got introduced to comedian who was kind of the mc the host for us and he went on to gain some fame and notoriety i saw him around a lot more in the ensuing years i think he passed away recently but he was the hype man and his job was to tell us what emotions to have and when to have them and how intensely to have them and i didn't like that at all i mean come on you've hung out with me for a while here you can imagine that might not be my favorite kind of thing ever and it was a pretty formative moment for me seeing how the sausage was made and the fakeness of the whole thing which i guess i could have deduced from a distance but instead i saw it there but whatever the case there were some segments on the show where people said stuff and espoused ideas and i was like yeah i don't think that i'm not gonna clap but clapping was mandatory clap cheer and you were supposed to yell like things like let me see if i remember whoa you're supposed to yell like whoa that was one that people seemed to really like um whoa no that might have been the only one you were supposed to yell you're supposed to clap and yell woo a lot i didn't yell woo at all but i clapped for some other things that i was neutral toward but i just didn't like a few of these ideas and like no i'm just not lending my voice to that being something i'm in favor of so i sat there with my arms folded and i had talked to by this comedian got warned a couple times and ultimately i made it through the show without getting kicked out for not pretending to respect ideas i don't respect and hold opinions i don't hold maybe you have found yourself in a place sometime in life where culturally everything about what's going on around you says that you need to pretend to like a thing you don't like you need to pretend to think that the thing that's happening in front of you is a super idea or that the disreputable person in front of you is a super person or maybe it's just something you're uneasy about and you don't want to have any opinion about it yet but you feel pressure to act like you do have a certain opinion if you have ever felt that you can relate to how i felt in that moment and i think i suspect that probably you can likewise also relate to how mortikai the jiu felt in a given moment when he was interacting with haman the recently promoted agagite in the citadel at susa and this moment where mortikai is in a decision-making moment where he has decided am i going to pay honor to this guy or am i not is something that's going to have much greater consequences than getting kicked out of a sports talk show it's going to have consequences that are very very far reaching not just for himself and his family and indeed his entire people group but his decisions are going to have consequences for the entire fate of the entire redemptive plan ever i've never really been in that kind of a situation so let's see how this plays out i asked her three diverse one after these events king zirxes honored haman son of haman ditha i think i've said that different every single time i've read it the agagite elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles okay agagite once again where we landed after three days of talking about it is we know that it is meant to signal to the original audience and to the attentive modern reader that this means that haman is dis favorably disposed toward the jews he doesn't like them he's anti-semitic in his orientation either because of a long-standing ethnic grudge is one of the last few survivors of this age old enemy this cousin people group of the jews or that said cousin people group in age old enemy of the jews lent their name to all future people in the persian exile era who didn't like jewish people and wanted to see bad things come to them so we're tipped off right off the bat that this guy it's not right that he got this promotion and that morte chi did not although there isn't anything here to indicate that he gained it by nefarious means i've read some stuff and i've seen some portrayals of haman whereby he's held out as it's having done something like real bad like he knocked somebody off or greased some palm sorry did something he wasn't supposed to do to get this gig and i again i just don't think the text gives us that there's a bunch of stuff here in the early going of ester where we really aren't just aren't getting any kind of moral qualification i think this is another one that he's an agogite so that's not good but maybe he was really good at his job and that's how he got this promotion and maybe the reality of the situation is it should have been a both and thing both morte chi and haman maybe both should have been promoted maybe he was terrible at his job i don't know the author just doesn't tell us that there's more than enough though in the rest of the book of ester for us to evaluate him based on what he does once he gets power to say yeah it's not a good guy and he kind of has whatever ends up coming for him as opposed to imagining something in the story here that we just don't have any sources or there's nothing that we can look at to say he must have gained this by nefarious means so for whatever reason he catches the king's eye and he gets promoted morte chi does not and he gets this seat of honor higher than all the other nobles well there we go again with that theme of access to the king Herodotus T.C.S everybody who writes about this era in Persian history and world history agrees they paint the same picture access to the king is the greatest commodity anybody could have or trade in at this point in history ester has kind of won that lottery already looks like things are going to be good but now that's immediately counterbalanced by someone who has a grudge against the jews and he gets this seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles i don't think that's a metaphor necessarily i think literally the seat of the most honored advisor to the king the person with the most access to the king probably would have been physically higher and physically in a closer proximity to the king in the noble court so that checks out good for that guy it's great super okay verse two all the royal officials that the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to haman for the king had commanded this concerning him all right so now we're back to the gate i'll tell you whose territory the gate is mortik i mortik i dominates the gate his gate game is a plus and one time he dominated it so hard like when was that anyway oh yeah two verses ago that he actually caught some people who wanted to kill the king so this is his turf he knows what's going on here well here comes haman from another position another department he's not gate guy and he's going to roll into this space i was just be honest about human and how you feel at your job or in your social circle or on your team or at your school when you've got a little area carved out where you've got a reputation and you've done things right for a long time and then some hot shot from some other department comes in and starts wanting to take credit and tell everybody in your department what to do how do you feel about that not good right it's threatening especially if maybe you don't think they totally deserve the promotion or maybe you think you should have been the one that got the promotion well i think in this situation all spirituality and good behavior and noble reasons aside i can imagine that someone like mortik i might feel some of those very human emotions and the characters in this book are presented as being very human bashti mortik i memukon zirksis haman they all got a real deep streak of relatable human nature i can imagine being him and i would not like the way this situation is shaping up at all especially the fact that the king was like he's to be honored so you're supposed to bend the knee now right now all of you who have read through the bible maybe those of you who listen who actually do the church thing and and live a christian life and care about how the bible informs deeply difficult decisions that you have to make and that you face in your life maybe your mind goes right to roman's 13 it's a passage where the apostle paul talks to the christians who are right under the nose of a violent persecuting emperor who was and would later do even more horrible things to that little fledging christian community shortly after the life death and resurrection of jesus and some people look at that passage in roman's 13 and they're like that's just paul saying just do whatever the government says uh I happen to think that's not the best read on that passage but I know many people just view it that simply until push comes a shove in that particular interpretive framework for roman's 13 breaks and it will break given the behavior of governments but maybe you're starting to feel a little moral conundrum happening here from your larger view of the bible and you're like wait a minute that means morti chi who is a jus is going to be expected to applaud and bend the knee and Fawn and fall all over himself to show respect to this person Who doesn't like the jus maybe even wants to get rid of the jus but maybe there's another part of The christian moral equation that you're running in your head right now and you're like but wait a minute Nobody should receive honor other than god I mean should you really kneel to anybody maybe some of you were thinking that What's happening is you and I are on a collision course for some oft competing ideals within christian moral thought as it pertains to the relationship between the follower of god And the power of the state and well frankly I find that little intersection to be very interesting And we're going to talk more tomorrow about all of that. Here's what you need to know though verse two wraps up like this but morti chi would not kneel down or pay him honor Was it the right call was it the wrong call? Why did he do it? but the bottom line is this is a fateful decision And morti chi in that spot like I was at when I was in the studio audience on that talk show and learn that spot that no doubt You have been in in many social situations He's got to make a judgment call Am I going to play along with this thing that I don't like whether the reason he doesn't like it is Noble or not is something we're going to debate and work through Or am I going to go along with this thing to save face and be a part of the current thing that everybody likes so I can show Everybody that I have the right opinion about the things And that I am on board with the one approved opinion well at times I suppose I've made both of those Decisions in response to this kind of situation But in this particular situation morti chi makes the fateful decision to be like, mmm Nah, no this time. I'm just not doing it and this simple little lack of this simple little gesture is going to have very Far-reaching consequences more on that next time around as is so often the case I have one quick little thing on the way out the door and it is that I would really like to direct you over to My new website. It's not really a new website I've had it for years and years and years and years But I just got done doing a huge overhaul on the whole thing Everything I'm a part of is all there I think it's organized really well and this is what I'm going for I the work was that I'm trying to transition that website from being Something like the rest of social media where everything just goes over the waterfall And it gets published and then it happens And if people notice it and then it just slides downstream and then the next thing happens like a twitter feed or facebook feed or podcast feed But I've put a lot of work into this stuff and I would like to think that It would be useful in a way that was more like a resource and less like a waterfall So we've put a ton of effort into organizing up stuff from The vast history of my youtube channel from the different series that we've done here I think it's pretty user friendly and straightforward And I would be super honored if you would go and take a look at that and just make a mental note of it Maybe it's a resource you would have a use for now or down the road You can get there by going to the tmbh.com But I added another URL just to attach my own name to it They go to the exact same place and that is mat dash wittman Dot com so the tmbh.com or mat dash wittman.com Hopefully both pretty easy to remember I'd be grateful if you'd take a second go check it out And if you have any feedback for me about ways that we could build that out better or tweaks that we could make I would be all Years, I would love that feedback. All right. Thanks for hanging out with me I'm matt. This is the 10 minute bible hour podcast.
