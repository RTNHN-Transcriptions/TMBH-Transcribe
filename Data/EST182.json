It's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. And yesterday we talked about themes and our ability, whether we use fancy words to articulate it or not, our ability that we all have to interpret stuff. Stuff means stuff. And over the course of a lifetime, or even part of a lifetime, we, without even trying, sharpen our skills to notice those patterns and see what stuff means. So we pick up on themes like themes and emotions and stuff that we carry with us from really well-crafted cultural texts. And right now, we're thinking through the list of most obvious, most pronounced themes in the Book of Esther. Yesterday, we started by talking about humor and humor against the backdrop of dark stuff, seemingly out of control stuff, humor against the backdrop of perceptions of fate versus the reality of the providence of God, how the humor has a wise, old, big perspective, kind of old woman, old man feel to it as opposed to a witty, zippy, sarcastic, biting, youthful feel to it. And I think one of the places where you see the humor thing play out the most in the Book of Esther is in this oft-discussed in this podcast, Second Theme, which is the clown king motif. I know I use that hyphenated phrase a lot. It is a phrase that I made up some time ago because to me, it expresses how the haughty leaders of the Bible always come off and none more so than Xerxes and Haman. In all of these clown king situations, including Pharaoh or Herod or, well, any of the Herod's in the New Testament, there's this imagined belief they have that they are somehow divinity and carnit and that somehow what they bind on earth is bound in heaven and that somehow they are the true makers of reality. But it kind of reminds me that stuff when the prophet was looking for the voice of God and the voice of God wasn't in the fire or the earthquake. God's spoken a still small voice like someone who isn't insecure, but the kings are always loud and brash and insecure and they bluster and yell and rattle sabers and they've got all kinds of titles and they're all dressed up in their fancies to always remind people, oh, I'm very, very, very important and terribly, terribly powerful. And so much of the humor in the book of Esther is very subtle. It's very dry, but it just needles all of those proclamations and pretenses that we get from the powerful people in the book. How about a Haman just not being able to handle the fact that one dude, literally on the best day of his life, still just one dude won't grovel at his feet and that's too much he can't handle it. He's so fragile. He's so weak. How about King Xerxes getting liquored up? He's getting ready to invade the western half of the world and he's pompous enough to imagine that all of earth should bend the knee to him because it would be better to have everything under his authority and leadership. But then he tells his wife to come to a sexy dance and she won't do it and he loses his marbles and it proves to be the beginning of his unraveling and ineffectiveness as a leader. I wonder even if the original audience would have viewed that as the beginning of an unraveling that cost him the full success he could have realized on that Greek campaign. Look, I understand that in the grand scheme of things, though I do not have any partisan loyalty. You're smart. You're good at interpreting things. You can tell that I'm on the far end of the slider of historical suspicion of government. I see a long litany of abuses and ugly stuff. I also see the potential for good governance and good and noble things that could come out of that justice. Not some raging anarchist, but come on, I've been around history for a long time. I've been around the Bible for a long time. I'm going to raise a skeptical eyebrow at those who want to wield the sword and have the monopoly on that. You can see it different. I know a lot of you are much more optimistic about the prospects of a human government bringing about really great things. Cool. We don't need to see that the same way or we can finesse it in different shades of gray. But I think whether I held that view or not, I still think it's a fair observation to make to say that the rival kingdom throughout the Bible or the rivalry throughout the Bible that we see with our faces as people is it's the state, it's the kings, it's the thrones, it's the principalities, it's the authority of this world versus the true king who can bring about true justice and true righteousness and true provision and true protection and to whom we can rightly give and acknowledge all accolades and all power and hand over all imagined rights we have to control because they'll never die. They'll never be a successor to this one true king who comes in and takes advantage of the goodwill his predecessor put together and then becomes a horrible tyrant with all of that leash and freedom and entitlement that he's been given because of the goodwill of his predecessor. No, those are the cycles of the world government and world kingdoms. The kingdom kingdom is upside down. It's totally different. All Jews are different and the king is reliable and good. Does not need to be restrained or to have his power separated into different branches for checks and balances? No, that's stuff we do to restrain human evil. And so this tone of almost mockery of all of these brash entitled powerful, gloating kings I think is as much articulated nester as it is anywhere else. And it's one of my favorite motifs in the whole Bible. So we got the humor thing as a theme of Esther that pops up a whole bunch every time we get near the clown king motif. Then we've also obviously got the theme of God's providence that ties into both of the previous two as well. We've talked about this one so much. You see it. There's no overt miracle in this book and that's weird compared to other narrative books of the Old Testament that certainly stands out. But it's also kind of cool to see a whole book where there is no overt miracle, but the outcome is more or less miraculous and more or less a confirmation of God's sovereignty over history and his ability to follow through and all the promises that he makes throughout the Bible throughout the through the prophets and throughout history that even when God isn't overtly and obviously breaking the laws of time and space, he is still directing the hearts of kings like a water course. He's still directing circumstances to bring about his glory and good and redemptive things and ultimately the completion of the redemptive plan and the completion of history as he's designed it. So he sure doesn't look like there are any flukes in the book of Esther. A whole lot had to bounce the right way and God, even though not mentioned, is fully in control of a situation that a whole lot of other people loudly and humorously bluster about being in control of a fourth theme of the book of Esther that we see is this ambiguity toward the characters on screen and some of the violent actions that go with it. For whatever reason, the author of this book really withholds from saying, and Esther was dumb to do that and Esther was right to do that and Mordecai shouldn't have said that and the eunuchs should have done this and Xerxes shouldn't have done that. It all kind of speaks for itself. Now obviously the author piles on pretty heavily with Haman and there's a whole lot of moral commentary and evaluation there, but everything else, just kind of left to speak for itself, including the violent outcome to the violent acts initiated by Haman. The point of this book does not seem to be to give you an exemplary character or an exemplary simplistic read on an outcome to a historical event, rather it acknowledges certain realities. It feels like there's a little bit of a let the reader understand tone going on there. It's got the humor, we got the clown king thing, we got the God's providence thing, I should say that louder because that's the clear big one. We have the flawed characters and ambiguity toward them and toward the historical outcomes in terms of the violence and whatnot. And then I would also add to this list, the idea of old scores, stuff left unsettled from long ago, coming back to bite people, generations later in the butt and it's not just the Saul and the Amalekite's thing. It's really the whole legacy of what happens in between the reign of Saul around 1000 BC and the events we're looking at here in the 480s, 470s BC. There's so much Ick in the previous big history book before Esther that being First and Second Chronicles, there's so much up and down, especially if you compare it with First and Second Kings, there's so much dropping the ball, not keeping up the end of the bargain of the Jewish people with God, from the covenant that was made with Moses. There's so many old scores, there's so many things that you can go back and break down as you familiarize with this story that all come to a head and play out to some degree in the book of Esther. Esther does not happen in a bubble. There are age old stories all coming to confluence, loose ends all flapping in the wind that get settled down and tied into some kind of braid or bow with what happens here in the final narrative book of the Old Testament. And then finally, the other theme that I want to highlight, and I mean, there are more of their different ways to characterize this. I look forward to hearing how you would put together your list of what the themes of Esther are, but then the other one would be that a historical theme, a historical theological theme, that yes, God's people are in exile, but as we discussed a couple of days looking at the book of Jeremiah, God still is seeing through the redemptive plan. And even when the deal, the arrangement, the relationship between God and his people seems frayed on one side, that God is steady and faithful. And even if people forgot that he said he was going to come through and they still had plans for them to prosper them and not to harm them, even if they didn't even remember that, or if they totally doubted that, he still persisted in that. And in doing so demonstrates that he is not just some local, regional God or God of one people group that they built anthropologically to mimic themselves and to create a super-fied version of themselves to worship and make some sense of the world. But this is God holding himself out as the God of whether you are at your own temple or the God of whether you are in exile or the God of whether you are scattered to the four winds or the God of wherever you are. This is the God who holds himself out as being the God of all things, of all of history, of all of creation, of all of the sustaining of everything, and who is providentially sovereign over all of existence and all of people and all cultures and all of time. And that's a pretty bold claim made very artfully without the name of that God even being mentioned in this book. Still more of you have asked if Matthew stickers are going to be a thing in keeping with the Esther stickers that we're just getting sent out. And the answer is yes, we are working on those. I've seen the mock-up. It's amazing. That's going to be a few months down the road. But the next sticker that you will get for our Achievement Unlocked Sticker Collection will be Matthew. It'll be the same ground rules. You'll be able to go to the website and buy the white outline sticker no matter who you are. Does anybody wants it? Everybody who is supporting at the time I send out those stickers is going to get the gold outline special limited edition. Thank you version of the sticker. And then that small handful of you have done crazy above and beyond things that make me blush. You're going to get the super limited edition, super rad awesome hologram sticker of Matthew when the time is right. So yes, thank you for asking about that. That is coming. That was a lot to think about in terms of all of the themes and everything else. But I think it's going to set us up for two things. One, clarity looking back on the story that we just dealt with. And two, as we get into this little last bit of this series on Esther and look at the epilogue and look at what other people have done with the story, it'll help us to see how dramatically the themes change if you go back and mess with what the characters did and mess with what this beautifully symmetrically constructed story is in its core form. All right, I think that's plenty. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
