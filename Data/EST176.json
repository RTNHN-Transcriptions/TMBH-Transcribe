And right now, we're going through Esther. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. And today is the last little bit of the book of Esther that we're going to be looking at. Now, don't get any ideas because we're not flipping over to Nehemiah just immediately. There's wrap-up stuff. There's big picture things that we've got to look at, including seeing what we can learn about what happened to the characters and how stuff shook out right after this historically. I want to look at what some of the stories and legends that emerged around all of this are beyond what the Bible says. It's still fun to be had here. There's still some important stuff that we've got to do with Esther. But this is the end of the actual biblical text. And it goes like this is all of chapter 10. This is a tiny little baby adorable chapter right here at the end of everything. Here we go. King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire to its distant shores and all his acts of power and might together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king had raised him. Are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of media and Persia? Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews. Now, like I was telling you the other day that to me, the wrap-up on Esther, I mean, you can't, I'm not going to criticize the Bible. I think the Bible is absolutely spectacular. But from a purely narrative, just tell a story. If that were the whole point of the book, well, I think you should have wrapped up somewhere in the middle of chapter nine. But clearly the whole point of the book, the reason that the author wrote it, the occasion on which they wrote it was not just to tell the most dramatic version of the story possible with the best beats. It's a story that is meant to have an epilogue and the epilogue is kind of the application. It's the take home of the whole thing. And what is the take home? Well, as we've discussed a whole bunch already, it would appear to be, remember, don't forget all of this stuff. And also here's why we celebrate this thing. And here's how we celebrate this thing and where this came from. It looks like it's an attempt to combat the erosion of cultural memory that just naturally happens over time. It looks like in keeping with the impulses that we see that were going on in the Jewish community and Ezra and Nehemiah that we're going to look at a whole bunch in the next season, that there was an attempt to maybe check a bit of a cultural slide into apathy and into a repetition of age old mistakes. It kind of reads like, Hey, this whole thing happened because of an age old mistake all the way back in the time of King Saul. Let us not for even a moment newer generations think that age old mistakes cannot come back to bite us in the butt. We got to remember these lessons. We got to remember these things that we've been through. In that regard, it sort of echoes the way covenants were written in the Old Testament, where it begins with a restating of all of the things both parties have done. That's why you get all the stuff about the Lord your God, the God of Abraham, the God who led the captives out of Egypt and dried the Red Sea. That's a restatement of stuff that has happened. It has that kind of feel to it. That makes sense because there's a whole renewal of the covenant that is happening, I think very likely around the time that the book of Esther was actually written down later on in the era of Ezra and Nehemiah. It all fits together really neatly in terms of the purpose behind it. Then as we've also discussed, I think one more purpose behind all of this that is really drawn out and brought to our attention with this epilogue material in the 2nd of chapter 9 and in chapter 10. The one more thing we get here is a warning to anybody who would read over the shoulder of the Jewish people and be like, well, maybe I'd like to hurt that group of people, pick up where Haman left off. Well, hey, any future wannabe Haman seems to be the warning. This is what happened this time. Do you expect that you'll be able to do better than him? Or with the same force that was at work that thwarted his ill designs and boomeranged his evil and the harm he intended back upon him? Will that same force still be in play when you try it? So in the mind of the author and I think in the mind of any fair reader, this is an amazing story and elegantly told symmetrical story with bright, colorful, fascinating characters and all kinds of levels of application. But it's also one that has a point that the author has earned the right and the ability to give having enchanted you with a fascinating story. Now I don't know about this chapter division. I don't, I never know about the chapter division. Sometimes they make sense. Sometimes they don't make much sense to me. I don't really know why we need a chapter 10 here. It seems like it would make sense to me to just still call that chapter 9, that paragraph that I just read to you. But I don't know exactly what the tradition is behind this chapter break. Obviously the chapter breaks are something that we trace to a certain point in history. But especially when it comes to the Old Testament, I think it's reasonable to suspect that a lot of the chapter breaks pre date are earliest knowledge of when those might have been assigned. So I have no idea what the thinking is here. To me, it seems like chapter 10, just a few sentences long, just a continuation of the epilogue, the point of the story, moral of the story, lesson of the story theme that we get here. Let's just break down what we saw real quick. I think there are a couple of interesting points. One, we get the summary of what King Xerxes did. So it's symmetrical. It opens with Xerxes in his great and majestic reign. It ends with Xerxes and his great and majestic reign. The whole bit about him imposing tribute throughout the empire. That's one of the things that's kind of a bummer about emperors, isn't it? Use your labor to fund all of their little endeavors. But that's just the deal. That's how it's always been. And so this is held out not as being a mark of a great thing to do, necessarily. I think it's value neutral. I think rather it's an expression of his power. We're talking about Xerxes who didn't just claim ownership over all the corners of the world. We're talking about a Xerxes whose ownership over the whole world and authority over the whole world is demonstrated in the fact that people believed in that authority enough that they gave him money when he said to give him money, which is a very good indication of actual power and actual authority. That whole bit there in verse one of Esther chapter 10 is all about propping up the authority of Xerxes to say that whatever he actually did, he's a really important guy. He's really well known. It would be written down and you could go and look all the stuff up in this story. Indeed, that is how they round out the thought in verse two with the bit about how the annals of the kings of media and Persia, which would have included all kinds of stuff about art as Xerxes and then Darius and before him, Cyrus and all the things that we've talked about that went down included in that robust history that would have stuff about Greece and UNIX and court intrigue. It would also have stuff about Mordecai and this little episode with Haman and Esther as well. It's kind of interesting to me because if we wrapped up at the end of nine, it would feel more like Mordecai and Esther together are the heroes and they are exemplary. They're the metaphor, the model, the example. But chapter 10 seems to go out of his way to say that Mordecai effectively was the one who ruled from here on out. Maybe he had more actual lived power than Esther ever would and that during this time, things were right. They were good. They were noble. This is what good leadership could do for you. Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to kingserxes, preeminent among the Jews and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews. Now woven into there is another little hint about an exhortation to unity for the audience that is actually reading this. Now, I say another hint because back in chapter nine, I think there's a hint here with all of the clarification about the means of celebrating Purim and what day it should be celebrated on. It seems like there's a conciliatory tone being struck by the author here to try to say, whoa, whoa, whoa, we've got some unnecessary silly mounting tensions here at Friendly Fire. This is crazy. We're supposed to celebrate this as a glorious victory that we share together. Look, this is where it all came from. Let's get along over this and then here again, the idea that all the Jews held him in high esteem. There wasn't this weird quarrel, some division or anything. Everybody had moral clarity because they had all emerged from the flames at the same time. They had all endured to this great threat. They had all faced the abyss and they had all seen a God who maybe they imagined was done with them while they were in exile, who maybe they imagined only did amazing things in the past. But they had seen not really a miracle happen. There are no miracles recorded in Esther in an overt sense, which is unusual for narrative books of the Bible, especially the Old Testament. But no, instead, what is recorded is a series of events so unlikely as to result in a complete reversal of fortune from what should have been to what ended up being. And it seems like the author of this book really wants to chase that feeling. Hey, rather than doing the Blamey thing where we all get after each other again, the same spirit that caused us to divide our kingdom in half way back in the day after David and Solomon were in charge, instead of bickering and fighting and shedding each other's blood and undermining each other, let's use this as a little bit of a reset and appreciate what God has done for us as we look to the distant past and the recent past. And let's move forward renewed and with a new way of thinking about each other and our relationship with God and the world in general. And indeed, those themes are heavily on display in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. These ideas have taken a look at the past and being grateful for what God had done in the past. And then having that change things, the idea of religious renewal, religious revival amongst the Jewish people during this era, as you'll see when we get into Ezra and Nehemiah was central, defining this would set the trajectory for what Judaism would look like for the next 500 years, maybe more, maybe all the way till this day. And so I think it's very important as we get down the home stretch here to say, well, why is the author giving us all of this extra stuff? Well, there's those purposes we talked about earlier, remembrance, a warning to anybody who would oppose them and an exhortation toward peace amongst people who might celebrate this new holiday a little bit differently to explain where the holiday came from and to highlight the reliability of this story and the reality that stuff was really good when this Jewish guy Mordecai ruled in a good way. And there was unity during that time. And that is something we should aspire to moving forward. In that regard, Mordecai could almost be viewed as a completion of a very famous prophecy that you probably heard of. And I think we've talked about before here, and we'll discuss how that all fits together as we began the process of looking back on the Book of Esther next time around. I'm Matt.
