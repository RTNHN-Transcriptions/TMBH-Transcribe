We're the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we're in the middle of a very fun epilogue, for me at least, where we're working through the question of did the book of Galatians work? We're finished going through the book of Galatians. We're still on this season, this series on Galatians that we're getting close to wrapping up here. But I wanted to know, I had a historical question and my historical question is, did it work? Did the churches that the letter of Galatians were written to, did they believe it? Did they take it? Did they internalize it? Did Christianity work out there? And so to answer this question, because of the nature of the geography of this era, the geography of Galatia, we have to really look at about six towns to try to establish an answer from history to that question. We don't know exactly which town's Galatians was written to, but it was surely Lystra Iconium, Derby, Pecidian, Antioch, and or a little town up North called Gordian and or a little town up North called Ankara, that almost surely would have been in view in this letter, just based on Paul's travels. It had to be some or all of those churches that Paul was writing to here. So we're just looking at all of those churches. Yesterday we started looking at the city, the community of Derby. Derby is a little town in southwest Asia Minor, Turkey. It's straight north of the island of Cyprus, where Paul's first missionary journey started. And it's almost straight west, but west and just a little bit north of Antioch in Syria, well, ancient Syria, which was the home base for all of Paul's missionary journey. And what we know so far is that it's kind of a barren, high plateau area. We got that from the ancient geographer's strabo yesterday. What we also know from a few ancient sources is that this central Asia area was kind of wild in between space politically and militarily. It didn't quite fall under the control of the Eastern powers in the first century BC in the first century AD. And it didn't, it took a while that is for it to come under the umbrella of the newly formed Roman Empire. So in the late Roman Republic, which a lot of people, I guess you could say kind of ended with the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. In the late Republic, there was a king named Amantus. We mentioned him yesterday because strabo, the ancient geographer mentioned him, this Amantus fellow was pretty influential. He was kind of a unifier, a reformer who went around and saw that all these towns in southern Galatia, if we can call it that, the towns that we've had in view, Derby, Listeri, Coney, Impiscity and Antioch. He saw that they were kind of a scattered mess and a lot of other towns around there were as well. And so we made unification efforts. I'm not saying he was like a good guy or a bad guy per se. He was a loyal T-flexible politician and king who made common cause with whichever faction in the Roman Civil War that was going on out West seemed to be winning. At some point, he was all team Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Then at the very end, when it was clear Mark Antony and Cleopatra were going to lose and that Julius Caesar's godson Octavian was going to win. All of a sudden, he liked Octavian a whole bunch and Octavian, who became known as Caesar Augustus. That is the Caesar who called for the censuses that caused Mary and Joseph to go back to Bethlehem and Jesus to be born there. Caesar Augustus appreciated that this amontus, the last king of the Galatians, came around to his side. It looks like amontus was given a very long leash there in the region we're looking at of Galatia to try to pull everything together and get rid of little micro-kings and bandits and pirates with either the blind eye of Rome or maybe even the blessing of Rome. What we know though is that at one point, he conquered the king of Derby who was like a bandit king. That's pretty cool, right? Derby, a few decades before Paul showed up, was ruled by bandits. It was a hive of scum and villainy. Interesting. And then amontus came to town with the casual blessing of Rome, wiped out that king, built a palace there and started to build walls. This is Strahbo's geography book 12 chapter 6. There's the town of Derby which lies closer to Capidocia than to any other country and was the royal seat of the tyrant, Antipater Derbites. But in my time, Strahbo goes on to say, that Derby as well as a couple of other towns have been held by amontus who attacked and killed Antipater Derbites and then effectively received possessions from the Romans as a result. And indeed after destroying presumably the occupiers there in and around Derby, amontus, the last king of the Gauls, built for himself a royal residence there. And though he was building a new wall in the same place, he did not live to complete it, but was killed by the salissians when he was invading their country. And he got captured and there's a whole story there that isn't particularly relevant. What Strahbo does go on to say though is he indicates that these ambitions of amontus, the last king of Derby, were very costly. That the young men all died from this whole region that he would come along and conscript these men and do his army, his unification army, and that it was very expensive in terms of loss of life. And so this region, and particularly Derby where he kind of set up shop late in his reign didn't have a lot of young men around the time of Jesus' birth and in the first few decades. This is very important to our conversation because Derby continues in some prominence for a little while after the new Testament, but it seems like a town in decline that's only kind of being propped up by the Roman presence. There's no more king of the Gauls there descendants of amontus to keep things moving forward. The Romans have set up colonies in neighboring towns, but it doesn't look like Derby got quite the same blessing from the Romans, even though we do know that Derby really trying to be like, we're also very Roman. Hey, Rome here, a emperor's. We're also great. In fact, we decided to rename our town Emperor Claudius Claudius ruled from 41 AD to 54. So Claudius was probably emperor when the book of Galatians was written and was definitely emperor when Paul went to Derby. So during that time, they were trying to rename themselves and rebrand themselves as Claudio Derby and even minting coins from there that had Claudius' image on it to be like, look, you could favor us too, but there's not much of an indication that that happens. And it's possible that Derby had already just mathematically experienced such a loss of life with their young men that they went into some kind of local population collapse. And without an influx of a serious Roman presence, there just weren't young men enough to keep this town on the upswing. So it still maybe looked okay. It was still maybe coasting from its glory days when Paul showed up, but it was maybe a town in decline already. So I think this is really important to our conversation, because at least for this one, for Derby, we have an indication that factors that have nothing to do with Christianity or the arrival of the gospel or the book of Galatians might have already been so in motion that Derby was going to go into decline anyway. And if it did go into deep decline, well, there might not be much left there to look at. They might not have had money to build any kind of early churches. They might not have had enough money or population base to be influential enough to really get mentioned. So on the one hand, that is worth noting. But on the other hand, we've got just a few scant records from the fourth century AD through the seventh century AD of four bishops who we know nothing about who apparently presided over some little diocese that was headquartered in Derby. So what that tells me is that at the very worst, Derby maybe died down for a while, then experienced a resurgence and bishops were appointed there for a little while before it went back into decline. Now, we know that ultimately the fate of Derby and the little towns right around there is whatever was left got more or less crushed during the invasions that ended the Byzantine Empire all the way up in like the 11th century. But I suspect that little Derby was pretty much already gone and off the map before the Byzantine Empire was formally defeated by the Seljuks in 1071. Okay, so we got a couple of clues about Derby here. One is what we know about the history and the general trajectory of the town before Paul and Galatians even showed up. Two, we've got a little bit of documented written history that indicates that at least at some point, there was at minimum a resurgence of the church there a little bit or at maximum. Maybe this little church in Derby kept chugging along all the way up to about 700 AD. There's no mention of any representative from Derby showing up at any of the big church councils. We've got pretty good records of who went to that. So if there were bishops or there were a church there, they weren't influential enough to get that invite kind of a bummer for them. But that leaves one more thread that we need to pull on here. We got the extra biblical historical stuff. Number two, we've got church documentation stuff. But number three, what happens if you put a shovel in the ground? Is there anything there? Is anybody ever wondered about Derby? Like we're wondering about right now? Well, the answer is yes, people have wondered about it, but they just don't have enough money to do much about it. Like so many little towns in the Bible, Derby completely disappeared. I got covered by sand and dirt and maybe other buildings or whatever. As I'm looking at a photo of what tiny bit of excavation has occurred at the site of Derby right now, it just looks like a farm field like Western, it looks like Scott's Bluff, Nebraska, to me. It is exactly how Stravo described it in his geographies. Wind swept, maybe a good place to graze a donkey or something. So what's been excavated here? I would estimate that what I'm looking at that got excavated in 2013 is maybe look a little bit closer. I think I've got the dimensions. Yeah, 250 by 150 meters have been excavated and there is a mound that stands apparently at its highest point 30 meters in height. So it looks like there's actually a ton that could still be excavated here, but there was work done in the 1950s and then work resumed in 2013. In the 1950s, they did find a couple of inscriptions here saying it's Derby. So we're pretty sure this is Derby, but even though they've found a nondescript religious building, which is probably more likely to be some sort of pagan temple than an early Christian church, but maybe they haven't figured out exactly what was worship there who was worshiped there. Despite that, this just, I mean, it hasn't drawn funds. And so I think this is sat dormant for quite a while. This does not look like a tourist or pilgrimage destination, but I bet a bunch of the answers that you and I are curious about are sitting underneath this pile of dirt right now. And at some point in our lifetimes, I bet somebody digs it up, finds the funding for it. And we get more answers about whether or not Galatians stuck in the early days of Christianity. I know we've been going for a minute here, but I want to do one more thing. And this is incredibly simplistic, but I'm just going to go to the place where Derby is on Google Maps right now. And I'm going to include the town that it is near the modern town of Karaman. And I'm going to go up here in the search bar and I'm going to search church and hit enter. And we're going to see what happens. Are there any Christians still there? Well, it looks like it. Yeah, here's a church in Karaman. I mean, it's very ancient looking. But yeah, that's an ancient Christian church that's still there. I see some super old frescoes here. It looks like one of the holy family. Yeah, here's another church. This looks much newer. Let's scroll down a little bit closer to the actual ruined site and search church again. Okay, interesting, interesting, interesting. Here's something called dog pazari church. It's a historical landmark. And what do people have to say about it? It's poorly maintained and nobody cares for it. Yeah, there is not much left here. There are no signs for it at all. It can be visited, but it's been destroyed, said to see history in the state. The original name is coral peace. So I don't know what that is, but it's right in the region here and it does look like that is some sort of ancient church building. There's a lot of relics of churches here that are so old that nobody even knows what to do with them or when they were there, at least according to Google Maps. Okay, well, that's very interesting to me because a couple of these churches, as I'm looking at the map, are just exactly where I understand Derby to have been. I mean, exactly. Okay, is there anything worse than listening to someone scroll things on the internet? Because you get that half brain speech. Oh, look, oh, just look at that. Sorry, you're all very patient, but that was very interesting to me. We're going to check Derby off the list. And in terms of level of certainty, one being we have no idea what happened there and 10 being we got a pretty good sense. I'm going to give Derby like a two or three. But what we see there indicates that Christianity hung around. We've got four bishops from 381 to 672 AD. We've got the ruins of very ancient churches around Derby. And we have a valid theory based on ancient sources for why Derby might have just been in population decline. And that would offer us an explanation for why we don't really hear about it much after the Bible that has nothing to do with whether or not the message took, but just has everything to do with political stuff, population stuff. I'll tell you this, I know we've got more on Lystra because I've cheated ahead a little bit, but I don't know about the other ones. So we're going to unwrap that present together and keep trying to get to the bottom of whether or not Galatians worked. I just want to pull on a few more of these threads and see if we can offer a smart take on a really valid historical question that I don't know if anybody has properly answered before. So we're going to keep working on it for a bit. All right, that's good for now. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
