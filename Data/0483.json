So you write down all the checks that you wrote to who they were to and the date and you write down how much they were for and then at the end of the month you're going to get a little statement, you need to go through it and make sure everything adds up and the amount of money that we say you have is the amount of money that you say you have and you got to stay on top of that and I was like, oh, that's important. I'll do that and mom and dad were like, well, if you can't do that, you're not ready to have a checking account. I was like, you can count on me. I can do this. But you're in a hurry and back then you wrote checks for everything. Like you couldn't even go to Burger King and swipe a card. You were literally getting out your checkbook and licking the pencil and jotting it down in your little ledger, how much you just did. And then you grab their little ink pen there that's got a flower taped to the end. You write a check for like $3.09 for a whopper and some fries is really how life was. Sometimes you just miss things and you get to the end of the month and you so badly want everything to add up and you're off by like three cents and you're looking there and it's like, ah, that that purchase there. Wendy's was $4.11 but doesn't that second one look like maybe it could also be a four? Maybe it was $4.14. I mean, it's just one little crooked line that would solve all my problems and make everything fit. Maybe I gave into that temptation to just be like, I probably just I can sort of see that line there. I think that resolves it. Now the checkbook is balanced. Look, mom, dad, I balanced the checkbook. I got the same amount they say that I got at the bank, but balancing your checkbook is at the point of a checking account. It's important. You want it all to make sense. But the point of a checking account is that they have like money that you have access to that's kept in a safe place and that you can write trustworthy notes to the other people so you can do business. Likewise, the point of the Bible is that God made things, things fell apart, God demonstrated his awesomeness by staying in instead of bailing on it and redeeming the whole thing. And there's an end game to all of this redemption and we're looking at the big culminating event in all of it in Matthew, which is a human incarnation of Christ and the cross and the resurrection and all of that business. That's the point is that God is glorious. He's the point of all things in the kingdom that he's building here. It's the truest, realist thing ever and he's redeeming stuff that's broken and it makes him look incredible. And it's a really, really good deal for people who get swept up in that process of redemption. I mean, awesome. But again, likewise, sometimes making the thing balance can become a preoccupation for us. We just need all of the numbers to add up just perfectly. And if anything doesn't add up perfectly, it feels like we're doing Bible wrong. It feels like we're doing theology wrong. And so I think there can be a little bit of a panic. And I think sometimes when we run into some of the harder questions in the Bible, even the best of us can get to a place where we're looking at that $4.11 to Wendy's. We're looking at that one little theological detail and it really does look like it's $4.11. But if it were $4.14, it like solves everything. Everything just clicks into place. And so I think sometimes without any intention to be dishonest or screwy, we can fall in love with the patterns and the process of balancing everything in the Bible to make our system of theology work really neatly. And as a lot of good people over 2000 years try really hard to do that with a very complex book that has some very complex questions. They're going to get to a place where they feel like, ah, ah, eureka, like it's, it's that's the thing right there. That one little thing. If you just read this one passage this way, then the last big hard question of the Bible is solved. I solved the Bible, but somebody else is like in another part of the world and they're like, no, I just solved the Bible. And if your solution is right, then my solution can't be right. I'm telling you my friends, one of these places where that temptation to maybe just accidentally a little bit see what we want to see here or there to quote balance the checkbook of the Bible. One of the places where we're tempted to do that is on this question of the grand narrative of the text and how Israel and the church fit in there. And as we've been discussing for the last couple of days, that's the stuff that we are getting into in this part of the book of Matthew. So we've been working on that. I told you today what I wanted to look at were some of the different conclusions that people have come to as they're trying to balance the checkbook of what they see in the Bible in front of them. You got a spectrum here where on the far end to let's just say the left, these aren't like left, right, like politics or anything. It's just how I'm holding up my hands. On the far end of the spectrum to the left, you've got a group of folks who would say, God picked Israel in the Old Testament, but it was always a spiritual group. There was nothing truly national about that people. That was always a surfy thing. The spiritual reality was the reality there and the Jews had their chance. Israel had their chance. They rejected God. They would read some of the stuff like you and I just looked at in Hosea a few days ago and they'd be like, God divorced Israel and has replaced Israel with a new family of faith, which is the church. Now I see that new family of faith stuff all over the Bible too, but that out and out replacement thing is kind of the extreme one end view. Critics of this would say, well, that just detaches the Old Testament from the New Testament. It disrupts the unity of the whole thing. And it leaves a whole bunch of promises that would seem to still be hanging out there to Israel. I mean, who knows exactly how those would be fulfilled prophecy kind of only makes sense after the fact sometimes. But the critics of this position would say, at least some stuff hanging that it looks like still needs to be resolved. So you got that view that would say the church replaces Israel completely. Israel has been judged. That is the end of that. If there's any hope for salvation for the Jewish people, it is fully within the church. Then you got people on the far other end of the spectrum who would say, no, Israel is a very separate and distinct thing from the church entirely. God has a completely other plan of salvation and deliverance for ethnic Israel that is different than the plan of salvation that exists through like Jesus and the cross for Gentiles, for non-Jews, for everybody else. There's some other program that exists here because God does very different things in different times this crowd would say. Some people on that far end would say that right now the plan for Israel is on pause, but God's not really doing his thing with them. But time will end for the rest of Christianity, for all the people who believe in Jesus, the end of time will happen. And then God will pick things back up with Israel and we'll round out the promises and everything there. The six of that position would say, well, yeah, but Jesus is pretty clearly the hinge on everything here. And the text pretty clearly teaches that Christ is the only way to the Father. And so like having a separate program or a separate deal for the Jewish people. I don't know about that. So if those are the two far ends of the distribution, then in the middle, you've got maybe leaning more toward the left end, that replacement idea a little closer to that end. You've got the historical reformed view, the covenant theology, I suppose you'd call it. And here the idea is that you got two covenants. One is a covenant of works where you are saved by your absolute perfection of behavior. They would say that covenant is over really, really quickly. It just doesn't take people very long to blow that one. And then everything after that is effectively, no matter how you frame it or package it or no matter what part of the Bible you're looking at, it's really all the grace of God and any salvation that happens in there is by Christ, even if people didn't know his name yet because they were around way, way before him. And even if they're doing like the sacrificial thing and the Old Testament or following the law, still the retroactively, if they're right with God, there's only one way to the Father and that's through Jesus. And so in light of that, this covenant crowd has a very easy time with it here because they would just say, well, Israel was a faith community under the grand auspices of God's dealings of grace. It's just, I mean, the law was around it, but it was still a gracious deal from God. And now that covenant, that grace deal morphed or completed into the deal that people think of as the new covenant where Jesus and the cross and his resurrection and all of that business is the ultimate sacrifice for sin and resolves everything. So for the covenant theology person, they would say that's a pretty natural progression, a pretty natural morphing toward those ends. And then you've got finally a position that comes in somewhere in the Middle-ish. I'm not even sure what to call it. This seems to be a pretty popular view in the early church. It seems to be a pretty popular view over the last several hundred years. I guess the term is pre-millennialism. Here the view would just be that Israel is a distinct thing. There is a nation there and there were promises that were made to the nation, but at its core, Israel was always a spiritual entity too. And it was always God's family of faith and it was always a family of faith that was supposed to grow. And that shows up in the covenant that God made with Abram in the very beginning about you're going to be a blessing to all the nations. And then it does grow and things get rocky and weird with the nation of Israel and the Jewish people. And yeah, it gets really bad in places like Hosea like we've referenced, but then ultimately the king comes to the Jewish people, to his own people and a bunch of them respond. But the leadership rejects him. So I guess this historical, pre-millennial centrist position would be that the rejection that we're really seeing Jesus talk about here late in the book of Matthew is a rejection of the religious leadership of the time, a rejection of the people who followed that religious leadership, but that there was also very much a remnant and that what the Old Testament would call the remnant of like the Jewish people who got it and we're looking for the Messiah and we're faithful to God, that remnant who had eyes to see and ears to hear, well, there is real, but they're also the church. And so the promises that God made to Israel in a way are being fulfilled also within the boundaries of the church. And I suppose within historical pre-millennialism, people might be comfortable saying there could be further additional fulfillments that that happen in a more practical sense as well. And I think, I don't know, I at least would say if you hold that position, probably the right attitudes is say it's going to be difficult to see that on the front end, but it might come into focus on the back end. Now, you're going to be tempted to hear that and be like, okay, well, the right position is always the middle one. So we're going to go with the middle one. I don't know. This is a very tricky question. What I do know is that again, the best of us, because we want everything to fit together so neatly and we want to feel like we have this thing totally in our hip pocket, the best of us might put a crooked line on that 411 check to Wendy's to make it for 14 to just make everything balance. It doesn't really, you know, it's not the big deal. We just want it to work so bad. It's not really lying. It's just sometimes, I don't know, it's just that little subconscious part of you just so badly wants it to fit. And I say that not to accuse people of dishonesty. I say that rather to empathetically acknowledge that people I disagree with are not arriving at the conclusions they arrive at because they're crazy people who just want to ruin the Bible and articulate heresy left and right. They're trying to make sense of the same thing I'm trying to make sense of. And look, this question is hard, my friends. Of all the big Bible questions that exist, this one simultaneously seems the least relevant to most modern Bible readers and also seems to leave the most room for varying positions. So what you end up thinking about this is going to affect the way you read the rest of the text and some of the historical divisions between Christians actually do come back to this kind of thing, which is both a pity and also understandable. At the most basic level, we can say for sure, God made a family of faith through Abraham. Somehow at least part of that family of faith becomes part of or overlaps with this new family of faith that is not about ethnicity. It accentuates those elements of the old family of faith that really were about the spiritual reality of that group and says, this is going to be a spiritual kingdom. This is going to be a spiritual family. This is not going to be drawn along ethnic lines anymore. Clearly that change happens as we get into the New Testament and clearly Jesus is rejecting the fruitless, wrong headed, stubborn, God obscuring leadership of his time that held their people under sway. There's obviously something special about Israel. There's obviously something heartbreaking that happened that breaks Jesus' heart about what happened with Jerusalem and with Israel. There's obviously a new family of faith and a church. I think it's very reasonable to look at all of that and hold it simultaneously as being true and to believe that with all of the promises that God has made throughout the Bible, that he'll be faithful to deliver on all of those things because everything that we've come across so far involves him delivering on all of those promises, even if we might not be able to conceive of exactly what that deliverance is going to look like on the front end. There I now feel like we are set up and ready to go in getting back to the text in Matthew chapter 21 and into 22 so that we've got some kind of framework to think about the things that we're looking at here and the weight of the discussion that goes with it. I know this is a little longer one. Thanks for bearing with me. I do think this was important and hopefully it sets us up for a ton of success moving forward. Alright, I'm Matt.
