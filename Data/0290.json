I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. As I am recording this, we're coming up on Christmas Day. So if you're listening to this in the original run, hey, Merry Christmas. I hope things are beautiful where you are. I hope that you feel a sense of peace that goes beyond this little moment in history and gets into the transcendent and stuff that is bigger than you and stuff that is worth putting hope in. I hope you're encouraged by the things that this season means. And if you are listening to this not in its original release and after the fact, I hope the last Christmas you had was good. It's just a strange thing about the medium, I guess. Here in my right hand, I am holding a little micro SD card. This is the thing that I use to store audio data from my little recording thing over here that I take to my computer before I send it off into the Internet. And I was a month ago or something, we recorded a really cool podcast for my other podcast, no dumb questions that I do with my buddy Destin from Smarter Every Day. And I don't know what I did with the SD card. It went away and I have this whole mountain of SD cards. It's an organized mess over there by my computer and I'm digging through it and we had a third party call in a really smart guy. And so there's no way to go and redo the thing. It doesn't fit anybody's schedule. We have to publish this. My I don't know what I did with the file. And when I finally found it, it was such a relief after going through all of that content to find this little, I mean, I'm looking at it here, maybe half inch by a third or a quarter of an inch wide paper thin piece of plastic. It weighs nothing. It's tiny. But there is so much potential contained in that card after we put in all the work to record a podcast that hopefully turned out to be good. Likewise, this theme of something very, very small containing enormous world changing potential is a crucial theme throughout the book of Matthew. Now right now you and I are working on Matthew chapter 13. It's called the Kingdom parables discourse. And we're going to see some of these really simple little parables that point out this principle. There's something little and tiny like a mustard seed. Looks like it's nothing but it grows up into this big gigantic thing that provides all of this stuff or something tiny, almost imperceptible, like a little bit of yeast. And as this by percentage, little tiny amount of stuff gets worked into all this dough, it transforms all of it. And the idea here in Matthew 13 is that that's how the kingdom works. Because seed, these little data packets of the values of the king and the kingdom that the sower and the parable is scattering around indiscriminately, all of these things have the potential to grow up into something gigantic and again, world changing. But here in Matthew 13, we're not just being introduced to that theme for the first time in the Gospel of Matthew. We're introduced to that theme in the birth prologue all the way back at the very beginning where we started. And I, whenever it was like 300 and some episodes ago. It's all the way back at the beginning, you get this little kid that nobody's ever heard of, a record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Like, okay, well, for the original audience, Jesus is a very recent phenomenon as they're reading this book and trying to figure out what to make of him. But all of these names in this genealogy in Matthew chapter one, they're huge. And Matthew through 16, 17 verses ties them all together with the promise of David. So if the original audience could picture the bigness and elaborateness of all of the stories of redemption and failure and God's work throughout the entire thing that we call the Old Testament, then people could possibly start to imagine the scale of the potential that could come in this one tiny innocuous looking little baby. And even as I hear in my hand hold this almost weightless, tiny little SD card that has mountains of information and potential on it. So it's like Matthew is holding forward this tiny little baby and saying the potential goes beyond just being a part of a bigger story of genealogy. The intonation is that this baby is going to be a king and that the kingdom that comes with this baby is going to be the biggest deal ever. So the genealogy points us toward the bigness, the kingness that is promised in this little baby. But then also the stories that come after that, because not only do we learn over in Luke that an angel appears to Mary and spells out what this whole Jesus thing is going to be about, but over here in the less well known passage of Matthew one, we see the angel of the Lord appear to Joseph and spell more of the same stuff out. Remember this? Matthew one verse 20, Joseph son of David son of David. There's the king thing again, little thing, huge potential. Do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She'll give birth to a son and you're to give him the name Jesus because he will save his people from their sins. So just like Matthew 13 has the farmer's seeds, the mustard seed, the little bit of yeast all blowing up into something huge. So the promise is here, right on the front end of Joseph and then Matthew in the very next set of verses explains that all of this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet. The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will call him Emmanuel, which means a God with us. And then the very next scene we encounter is a contrast between this little baby with mountains of potential and this insane but wildly powerful tyrannical king Herod. And the story goes on to point out that even though this king, this leader of God's chosen people completely missed it. The outsiders saw the enormous potential saw where this little baby was headed and also nature even testified to what this little baby was going to be. And then we skip a bunch of years and roll forward into the beginning of chapter three. John the Baptist shows up and he says, repent for the kingdom of heaven is near and now grown up. Jesus arrives where John is baptizing and the spirit and the father show up. And now the trajectory of amazingness in Matthew is underway. And in between that moment at Jesus baptism and where we are right now in Matthew 13, we see that very intentional, very important theme of Matthew of this little thing that doesn't look like much growing up into something huge and world changing play out. And then Jesus starts to teach in these parables and we understand that not only is he talking about how the kingdom is going to unfold before his audience's eyes, but these parables in a way thematically harken back to what has already happened. The incarnation God become man and manual God with us. This little baby shows up. If you look close, you can see that his arrival ticks all the right boxes to be the promised one of God, the Messiah, the king. But even if you realize all those boxes are ticked, it's still just a baby and babies are not something we associate with monarchy and authority and the kind of power and presence that it takes to change the world and even more than change the world. I mean, what we're looking at here is the promise of a change of everything about existence and about human destiny and about fallenness and brokenness and straightening everything out that is messed up and wrong. And so it makes a ton of sense as we get to roughly the halfway point of the book of Matthew that Jesus would remind the crowds, the skeptical middle that they should not write this thing off just because it looked small when it started out or maybe even still looks kind of small now. This surprising still small voice little thing becomes big theme is how God works is what he did in the Old Testament, it's what he's doing through the biography, the life of Jesus that is playing out. And it's what he does invisibly, theologically in the realization of his kingdom. This card looks like a tiny little piece of plastic, but theoretically it's loaded with potential. Likewise, that little baby looks like just another little baby, but he's loaded with potential. Likewise, the starting point of the kingdom is Jesus is saying this stuff and as Matthew is writing it down, looks so modest. And here we are a couple thousand years later celebrating a time of year where we still take hope in what this kingdom is in the process of growing up in two.
