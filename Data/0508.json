It's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Thank you for hanging out with me. I know you have trillions of things to do with your time. Then I know these are just insane times in general. I mean, we live in this weird technological moment where we don't quite know which way we're going or what we're doing. And yeah, here we are hanging out looking at this ancient document together that holds itself out as being from not just an ancient deity, but it holds itself out as being from the God, the first cause, the philosophical, physical beginning of all things. And I know that a ton of you here are not down with that. You're in a place where you're like pretty skeptical of that claim. And yet you understand the importance of the book. You understand the value of the people in your life who hold it dear and who build their life around these ideas, this document that God behind it. And here you are making the effort. That is awesome. I know that others of you here, and you've been in from the beginning and you've never looked back and this is a fun opportunity for you to explore a text that is precious to you. And here you are. Thank you very much for being here. I know others of you are here because this made sense at some point. It's always kind of made sense, but also there's just something about the conversation that begs a little different angle or a little different dive into it. And maybe there's just something about you and me being on the same wavelength in terms of the ways that we're weird and broken and screwed up that maybe makes this time well spent as you try to untangle the Christmas tree lights of a lifelong faith and the questions that go along with that. Look, I just think it's cool that we're all hanging out because that doesn't happen anywhere on the internet. That's a very unusual thing and it speaks volumes to your character. Second, I think it's cool that we're hanging out with something that predates pretty much everything else that defines our life, that we're looking at something that claims to be much older, much more significant, that has much more greatly stood the test of time than just about anything else that we make a part of our daily rhythm and routine. So whoever you are, why ever you're here. Thank you very, very much. I feel like we're friends. I feel like we know each other a little bit. And it is an honor to get to share this journey with you today. That journey takes us to Matthew chapter 22, the last little bit of this passage, which has us looking at yet another confrontation between a member of a ruling religious party and Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus is overwhelmingly alone. He has disciples, but they're not equipped to fend off this stuff. They seem to be mostly passive observers in this thing. And as we're going to see in a few chapters, when the temperature gets turned up, they are not ready for prime time. So it's Jesus versus the world. Here we go game on. And he so far is handling the very best of what they can throw at him. But now we're getting to that scene that kind of reminds you of maybe Indiana Jones, raised a lost arc. That is, it's the scene where you have to face off against the strong man, the heavy. It's like, ah, you've defeated all these other squads of underlings with your cunning and your wits and your attention to detail and your good character. But now out comes the giant shirtless barrel, chested, mustachioed old school back of the Knuckles Bruiser boxer guy with his trousers, hiked up almost to the bottom of his nipples. And he is ready to punch you in the face again. And again, the guy doesn't get a name. The guy doesn't stay on screen for any extended period of time, but in literature, in storytelling, we know what this guy looks like. This is the sub boss. This is the bruiser. This is the big, tough confrontation that you have to face with the heavy hitter and the heavy hitter strolls up to Jesus here in Matthew 2234. It goes like this, hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees. The Pharisees got together, one of them, an expert in the law. This is my knuckle cracking sound. Tested him with this question teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law. Whoo, look at this. Okay. First of all, we got the big shot who's coming out. Everybody's gathered around now. This is Glenn and Glenn is the biggest of deals. So everybody gathers around. This is the showdown they've been waiting to see, but Glenn is a little bit different animal. I wonder if because he is so well regarded, maybe he's a little more secure in his own skin. Maybe Glenn is the type who actually is interested in the answer. You'll see as we go along that it's possible that we're dealing with true, a heavy hitter, but also maybe a little different character than the people who've been putting Jesus to the test up to this point. Wherever the case, he just bottom lines it. Like, all right, we had a fake parable. Yeah, of course you dealt with that one easily. I see what you did there. And we got this other stuff where the younglings came and asked you about taxes. You handled your business well there. I mean, I was there the other day standing in the back when the kids were saying all the nice things about you is the son of David. And you replied with that reference to the psalmate. That was really good too. But let's quit dancing around and just get right to the point. The spit goes into the palms, rubs them together. And now we got the back of the knuckles up like Notre Dame's mascot. Here it comes baby teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law. Oh, that's it. Like that doesn't actually sound like that much of a trap at all. That just sounds like a genuinely very important question. And while I might not as an outside onlooker be super excited to hear Jesus answer about seven dudes dying and some lady marrying them all and who's she going to be married to in the afterlife? I don't have whatever that's kind of boring. I'm just here for the fireworks. But this one I actually want to know the answer. Yeah, I just I guess I'm with Glenn since we're at it with which one is a big one. I suppose that would be something I'd like to get right. I have often thought to myself that if I could use one of my time travel tokens to go back anywhere in time, of course, I would use that on this. This is the pivotal moment in history that want to hang out with Jesus this week. I'd want to be at these exact things. If I only got seven days, I'm using it on these seven days right here for sure. I'm going to listen to these conversations. I'm going to look at that fig tree when it gets cursed. I want to know what happened there. And if I get a chance to talk with Jesus of Nazareth himself because I get to use a time travel token on this, I think one of the most obvious questions I would ask him would be, if you want me to get one thing right, they definitely nail this. What would be the one thing? Because religion is confusing and there's a lot and the Bible is very, very big. Could you just boil it down? Like what am I supposed to do? Glenn the shirtless bruiser is actually doing us all a solid here. Like that that kind of is one of the big questions. Jesus doesn't question his motives. This is really interesting, isn't it? Because when the younglings and the Herodians came up and asked him, Jesus opened his wrist response with you hypocrites. Why are you trying to trap me? So he fires right back and see what you're doing. When the sages show up and throw that blazey, the half thought through sort of parable at him, he leads with urine error because you don't know the scriptures nor do you know the power of God. He leads by calling them out, but Glenn, he just gets his question answered. Jesus replied, love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it. Love your neighbor is yourself. All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments. And you know what Glenn did after that, according to the text? Me neither. Cause it doesn't say, or at least it doesn't say in Matthew, I'm going to break one of my rules here. It's not a hard and fast rule. Just generally speaking, we bounce around in Matthew and only occasionally go to corroborating passages in other gospels. But it's a pretty important one over here in Mark chapter 12. Looks like this is the same anecdote. It's positioned in the same place at the same time. I think safe to assume we're talking about the same situation here in Mark 1228. But listen to this, one of the teachers of the law will call him Glenn came and heard them debating, noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer. He asked him of all the commandments, which one is the most important? So Mark with his emphasis on fast pacing allows the reader to imagine that Glenn is just in the background, shirtless, oiled muscles shining in the springtime Jerusalem sunshine. He steps forward and everyone gasps and he says, of all the commandments, which is the most important. And Jesus response is the most important one answered Jesus is this hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Now probably next time around, we'll break down how Mark is giving us a little bit more fleshed out version of Jesus answer because that's a more complete representation of the text he's citing from Deuteronomy six more on that later. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this love your neighbor is yourself. There's no commandment greater than these. Then we get a little bit more verse 32. Well said teacher, Glenn replied paraphrases mine on the Glen part. You're right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him to love him with all your heart with all your understanding and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. When Jesus saw that he'd answered wisely, he said to him, you're not far from the kingdom of God and from then on, no one dared ask him any more questions. Now we don't get the from then on, no one dared ask him any more questions until there's a little more tit for tat exchange with the Pharisees between verses 41 and the end of the chapter here in Matthew 22. But this is one of those places where I think it's really worth our time to compare the two things. Matthew allows us to come away with an impression of Glenn that Mark is content to go ahead and spell all the way out. And that is this dude was maybe not an antagonizer true. It was a test for Jesus and he handled the test the same way he handled all the others pointed to the authority of his father and to a text of scripture. And I think I resonate with Matthew's choice not to give us Glenn's response. How can you have a problem with what Jesus said there? Glenn's question was reasonable. We can only presume even if all we had was Matthew that Glenn understood that was reasonable and we move on to the next anecdote which we'll look at later on. I think that's a pretty cool scene. And I think the original audience reading between the lines in Matthew or comparing Matthew and Mark when those both were in circulation. I think they would have looked at that and had that notion of the remnant spring to mind that idea that there were going to be some who were going to recognize the Messiah who were going to stay connected to truth. There were going to be people who would connect the dots and see this for what it is. And it looks like maybe Glenn here is one of those kind of a fun change of pace. All right. We'll break down the rest of the passage next time around. Thank you so much for supporting this thing at patreon.com slash the TMBH podcast. That's weird when I say it that way. It just occurred to me. It almost sounds like not that genuine because the way I say it sounds like a sales pitch. Let me try it again. Hey, some of you support the program at Patreon. There's a website or whatever where you can go and do that if you want to, but you don't have to. It means the world to me that you do that because I love that we get to do this together and it happens as we talked about earlier because of you. Thank you so, so much. I'm Matt.
