This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we have been looking at Esther chapter 5 in this super dramatic scene where Esther puts on her royal robes after three days of fasting. She's got to go in and she's got to talk to her husband. Her husband is a very powerful man who she hasn't talked to in a very long time. She's got to go in uninvited, which can be an instant death sentence if he's not in the mood to see her. She's got to go in there and not only gain access to him, but if she can gain access to this king who's been pretty volatile about the access question in the past, then she's also going to have to figure out a way to socially navigate a brutally difficult situation to try to save her people from a human perspective. As we enter Esther chapter 5, it is a crazy long shot that she's going to be able to pull this off and save the Jews from the threat of the evil. Hey, man, but as we read yesterday, she clears the first hurdle. She enters the royal courtroom, the royal throne room, and Xerxes extends the gold scepter to receive her. I think this is one of the places in the story of Esther where the gravity of the situation is really difficult to understand unless you've done the work that we've done together over the last almost hundred episodes, these ancient kingdoms, these ancient situations, I think we tend to underestimate them because now they're gone. And so we imagine like if we time traveled back there, we just go around telling people what to do. I'd be an American and tell Xerxes how it is. I'd save them Jews. I'd save them real good and real fast. But that's not actually what would happen because this is a hyper sophisticated social system. This is a hyper sophisticated, nearly impenetrable bureaucracy that existed in the fifth century in SUSA. I mean, far more likely if I traveled back in time, I would be some guy's shovels poop or scrapes the ground bangs leather with rocks for a living. I wouldn't be a person with the access that Esther has here to the king. Just as a simple straightforward rule for how we think about stuff, the more removed we are from a situation culturally, the less we understand the gravity. We imagine that some silly organization over there. That's your little thing in your little club that you made over there. But there's power in institutions, especially institutions where they have a monopoly on violence and all the swords, as was the case in ancient Persia. Now, these stakes really were incredibly high. And even though this empire has since expired, it hadn't expired at this moment. So one way I think we can put ourselves in Esther's shoes and feel the tension of this situation a little better is to do what we did yesterday, just work it through or do what we just did right now. And remember that we always have an importance bias that is in favor of situations we understand and that works against situations we don't understand quite as well. But I think another way to understand this tension is to go and look at one in particular incredibly valuable piece of art that is held in the National Museum in Tehran, Iran, that is taken from another one of the capital cities of Persia that existed at this time, that being Persepolis. This is a town a little bit to the east and it's a town where a temple and a palace complex were built at roughly the same time as Sousa. It's almost like a duplicate of what was going on in Sousa. Persepolis was a newer town and also a more distinctively Persian town. Sousa was a much, much, much older town as we've discussed going back into primeval time immemorial layers upon layers of forgotten history. Remember, Sousa, as we are here in the book of Esther, had more years under its belt by a wide margin when Cyrus of the Great showed up than have passed from Cyrus the Great until now. Most recently, Sousa had been Ilamite territory, but the layers of history, I think just made it an irresistibly compelling place for Darius and Xerxes to make their headquarters. But still, these other capitals were also prominent and Darius and Xerxes worked out of these other capital cities at times as well. And there's one place in particular, not in the Apadana in Sousa, but in the Apadana in Persepolis where we've still got this carved relief. Now, you know what a relief is? You've seen this before. It's a form of sculpture where you take a block and you carve it almost like a side-scrolling 8-bit video game like think Super Mario Brothers instead of a three-dimensional type game where you're immersed in the world and you just remove material to leave profiles of a scene or a portrait or whatever it might be. And there's one particular relief that was on the north stairs of the Apadana in Persepolis that depicts we're almost sure Darius holding court. And standing right behind Darius is his heir, who of course we know to be Xerxes, both of them. I'm looking right at it right now, just describing to you what I'm seeing. Both of them, their royalty is signified by the headwear they have. Well, and also by the fact that Darius is seated on a throne with a footstool under his feet, his feet don't touch the ground. So you think of some of that language even from the book of Psalms that talks about the heavens and the earth is your footstool. That's an ancient Near Eastern symbol of authority that your feet aren't even on the ground when you're holding court. So we can tell that's Darius and the throne. He's holding also this flower of royalty and behind him is Xerxes dressed almost as extravagantly holding the same kind of flower of royalty. And he's participating in this scene in receiving somebody who's coming to bring tribute. And I can't tell from the picture who they are or what kind of tribute they're bringing. But what I can tell is that in the middle of this relief, you've got Darius, he's a centerpiece. Xerxes is right behind him. They're on this elevated platform and Darius has got what looks like a long golden scepter, exactly as described in the book of Esther. He's not holding it out to his guests, but it kind of looks like he's holding it forward just about to raise it to them. Now immediately behind Darius and Xerxes, you got a guy in kind of a floppy, frigid and looking cap, kind of like a smurf hat, but floppier. And this would be a megas. This would be someone like the Galmata, the shape shifter who Darius famously killed to become king of Persia. It's possible that the Magi, the wise men of the book of Matthew came to visit Jesus. We're descended from this same science philosopher, alchemist, astrologist sort of class. So he's standing right behind them, offering some sort of counsel or advice. And then right behind this megas are some armor bears. It looks like there are two guys holding spears and another that has sort of a Robert the Bruce battle of Bannockburn war hammer, not like a great big fantasy hammer kind of club thing, but like a little poky hammer that's meant to go right through somebody's helmet. And so the threat is present in this relief from the opadana of what happens if Darius doesn't raise his scepter. Clearly, if he doesn't receive these people or he doesn't like what's going on, they're more than enough things to stab or poke them to death. Okay, moving back to the right side of this relief, though, in front of seated King Darius, you've got two little incense burners that are coming up out of the ground. Incense burners like this have been recovered from Persian ruins over the years. We know what that is. It's happening right there. And then after the incense burners, we have a very nicely dressed but smaller man who we identify as somebody named Farnesees. Now this Farnesees guy is a part of the achaemenid family. He worked under Cyrus. He worked under Darius all the way up almost to the reign of Xerxes. So he knew both Xerxes and Darius and he was the mayor of the palace, really one of the most influential people in the entire kingdom for almost half a century. And we see him portrayed as blowing a kiss to the king from a distance. We know that this is the gesture that he would give to the king. This is what was expected when he brought someone in to pay tribute. Fun little side note about Farnesees is that his seal to approve the distribution of resources on behalf of Darius, that still exists. We know what that looks like all these years later. Pretty cool. And then behind Farnesees are these two guys who look like maybe they're there to bring tribute. That also looks like maybe they're holding spears. So maybe these are troops who are bringing back something of value that they're going to present to the king. I'm not totally clear on that. Maybe somebody else knows better. Obviously, I'm describing a picture to you on a podcast, but I'm going to have Jeff put a link down below so you can look at it and study it for yourself as well. I think between this conversation and looking at this work of art from the exact time period we're talking about here, I think you'll get a really good sense of how the original audience would have understood the tension of Esther coming into this room. I think you'll get a really good sense of what she was dealing with in this moment, what Xerxes was dealing with in this moment and what the dance steps socially of this kind of interaction would usually have looked like. I also think it's really cool that just straight up Darius is presented as holding that golden scepter probably the exact same golden scepter that Xerxes extends here in Esther chapter five. I think stuff like that is so dang cool. And for me, this is one of the really fun places where the extra biblical history interacts in such a fascinating way with the biblical narrative that we're seeing here. It's a quick reminder on the way out the door to everybody who supports the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast or through planning center. Please remember to check the patreon page or your email over the next couple of weeks. I'm going to be sending out a bunch of the fun music that Jeff has made for us here over the past few months. Thank you so much to all of you who support this thing. You're the reason this exists. And thank you also so much to all of you who don't. I'm thrilled that you're here and that we all get to do this together. All right. I'm Matt.
