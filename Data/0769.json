This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast you remember yesterday when I was like, and tomorrow we're going to start Matthew 28 because this is the most important thing in the Bible. Well, I've thought about it some more and I stand by my remarks that it's the most important thing in the Bible. Everything hinges on that. But about that thing where we were going to start on it today, as you know, on January 2nd, we're starting a whole new series where we're going through the entire Bible one book per day until we're done looking at how it all fits together. But looking at my watch here, even though I'm not wearing one because that's just what I do out of habit. And I'm seeing that we have plenty of time left to handle chapter 28 before the end of the year to dive deeply into it the way we do everything else. So let's take a minute and carefully consider how we got to where we are in Matthew starting here. The book of Matthew starts after like a fourth century break from what was in the Old Testament. In that time, empires rise and fall. The Persians rise up and defeat Babylon. Alexander and the Greek mercenaries and the Macedonians rise up and defeat Persia. Rome defeats their neighborhood rival way out west to the Carthaginians and they expand and take over Alexander's old territory and the Roman Republic, which looks a little more democratic morphs into the newly born Roman Empire under Caesar Augustus. And he's the guy in charge when we step back into the story of God's redemptive plan in Matthew chapter one. And it would seem like the big story of everything would be the dramatic ascendancy of Rome. But Matthew doesn't hold it out that way. For him, it's a story that's wrapped up in a bunch of names, a lineage of a whole bunch of people who came before. And his original audience would have known so many of the names in that genealogy in Matthew chapter one and every one of those names would have caused a story to pop about God's persistence, God's faithfulness, God continuing to do stuff even after seemingly long breaks from a human perspective. And what do all of those stories point to some kind of ultimate redemption, some sort of establishment of a kingdom that doesn't go away, some kind of establishment of a great king who will rule forever. And so Matthew starts by tying this whole thing into the grand story of everything, a story that is begging to be rounded out and completed. Then we get the account of his birth where in the Matthew account, Joseph particularly shines. Mary always looks awesome. In chapter two, Matthew gives us the exclusive account of the Magi, the intellectual descendants of people like Daniel from the East and Persia, or I should say presumably in Persia, who came west upon seeing the star and in the Christmas scene there. They not only visit the baby and bestow gifts on him fit for a king, but we also see a clown king, Herod, who's threatened by this and he wants Jesus dead and therefore he gives the order to kill a bunch of babies. God warns Mary and Joseph they leave to Egypt, which is such an interesting detail because that whole genealogy gives us stories that come in and out of Egypt. Egypt is factored heavily into all of this. Moses, a great leader of the people is someone who comes to mind when you think about Egypt. So it's not an accident that we have them going there and that Matthew gives us this detail. He also writes, dies, hands power off to his largely idiotic descendants and Joseph and Mary and now probably toddler Jesus come back to Nazareth. Between chapter two and chapter three, a whole bunch of time passes. So in chapter three, we meet Jesus cousin, John the Baptist. He has a confrontation with a whole bunch of religious leaders who are curious as to why there's a religious movement surrounding him out in the desert. And the big take home here is that he calls them out when they show up, much like Jesus is going to do later and he tells them that the kingdom of God is about more than who your parents were or where you fit in a genealogy like the one before. But what's being in tone is that there's a new family of faith and that God is going to raise that up and can raise that up out of whatever he wants. Then Jesus shows up, John the Baptist baptizes him. The whole Trinity is there to confirm that this baptism is the real deal and chapter three, we get introduced to this theme in Jesus preaching, which is repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. In chapter four, Jesus goes out into the wilderness and passes a test that nobody else in the Bible or the story of humanity has ever passed. It's the test of sin. Now everybody else in the Bible failed that test here. Satan actually shows up like the best liar, best deceiver ever to try to dupe Jesus into violating the plan that the father has laid out for him. And Jesus leans into the Bible and is like, no, I'm not going to be tricked by your partial misquotes of the Bible. He resists that temptation and after 40 days, he is attended to and he's back in the game. Jesus then goes and recruits most of the most famous disciples right after that. And then immediately after that, we get the first big speech around which the book of Matthew is structured. That's the sermon on the Mount. Jesus goes up on a mountainside around the Sea of Galilee in the region of Galilee, north of Jerusalem and Judea and he teaches them now there are a bunch of other people there and this is where we get introduced to this motif of the three part audience, the people who are in the disciples, the people who are angry and out, the religious leaders, the enemies of Jesus and the squishy middle who just aren't sure what to do with him, the people who are like sheep without a shepherd. In Matthew 5, 6 and 7, Jesus comes out of the gate. It's a tour de force. He comes out and he lays out the values of the kingdom. They sound totally different than the values of the world. He addresses what you do with all the things that have happened in the past with the law and the prophets and God and all of that and makes it clear he's not here to finish that off or replace it. He's here to complete and fulfill that. He then gives several examples of what the values of the kingdom look like in fulfillment of the Old Testament law, in fulfillment of religious practices in chapter 6. In the middle of the sermon on the Mount, he gives the example of prayer that we call the Lord's Prayer. It is effectively an oath of fealty, a bending of the knee to the king, his authority and his values. And it looks like if you can pray that as a follower of the king, that's what it is to assume a right position to be one who is admitted into this kingdom and who is transformed from being an enemy of the king, an outsider from the kingdom to someone who is not just in, but is a son, a daughter, a child, an heir, an agent of this kingdom. Jesus wraps up the sermon on the Mount, pointing out that this is true. This is the real stuff. This is the truest, realist thing and building the foundation of your life and your plan on these values of the kingdom and the hope that comes in the one true king. That's a good investment. Jesus is saying the values of the kingdom is better for life is better for what happens after this is the truest, realist thing. The other thing is not even though the world kingdom seems realer and tangible. It is not the realer thing. It is not the truer thing. And he gets done and everybody's amazed because he teaches like he has actual authority, not with the bantering, debating, talking heads, cable news kind of approach to truth and reasoning that everybody else who taught at this time taught with. In Matthew eight, Jesus now got to back it up. Lots of nice words. This kingdom thing sounds great, but lots of people say religious things. Do you actually have the authority to deliver on this awesome stuff that you described? And the answer is yes. And further the answer is, and it's not just for the people you'd expect who look the right way and sound the right way. It's for everybody. This thing breaks all the barriers that people are used to as Jesus extends the healing of the kingdom and the value of the kingdom to a Gentile occupying Roman officer to an unclean person with leprosy who is untouchable based on some of the interpretations of the ground rules of the Old Testament. Jesus demonstrates power over disease. He demonstrates power over even the weather. He demonstrates power over the legions of darkness, defeating demons and bossing them around. Then in chapter nine, he goes and ropes in another outsider, a sellout, a stooge for the Romans, a tax collector who turns out to be the guy who's writing the book we're reading. It's Matthew. People don't like it very much, but Jesus makes it clear that this is the kind of stuff he's there to do. These are the values of the kingdom. It is for everybody. It's truly a new family of faith and it exists for something that is real, not just for the empowerment of a certain class of people to maintain order in society and a steady flow of wealth and prestige for a select elite few. Well, by the time we get to the middle of chapter nine, we've seen Jesus fix about everything and demonstrate power over about everything except one thing, the big thing, dying. And then in chapter nine, we see him demonstrate power even over death, healing a woman who's bleeding, made her unclean and then resurrecting a young girl who had died. It's somewhere here in chapter nine, chapter 10, where we start to sniff the beginnings of tension between the religious leadership and Jesus. He's clearly starting to threaten them. They're clearly becoming rattled. They're clearly starting to take him seriously as a threat. No doubt they're running reports back down south to Jerusalem to the headquarters and the young lieutenants and lower ranking religious leaders who've been sent north to observe and deal with Jesus. They're realizing we might be outmatched here and gradually over the next few chapters, bigger hitters are going to start making their way north to try to solve the Jesus problem before it gets any more traction. Well, Jesus has other things in mind because in chapter 10, where we get the second of the five great speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured, Jesus sends out his disciples with the same message he's been teaching. We get a list of who those guys are, the super famous ones, the 12, and then he sends them out with a message, go tell people to repent for the kingdom of heaven as at hand. But he imbues them with power that looks like a version of his own to go out and do miraculous stuff and he famously commissions them with this very pivotal verse, not just for the book of Matthew, but for like the whole Bible and the entire Christian proposition in verse 16, he says, behold, I'm sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. There's your guidelines for the whole thing. Don't be rubbish idiots, but also don't go violating the values of the kingdom as you try to advance the values of the kingdom. Jesus lays out for them what it's going to be like on this particular trip on trips later on within their lifetime as they are confronted by people who don't like these kingdom value things. And he seems to in tone what it's going to be like much further down the road for other people who go out and try to say and do things in the name of Jesus down the road. Chapter 11, they all come back. Looks like things went fairly well, but it also interestingly looks like not everybody signed up. And that's in keeping with what Jesus predicted in Matthew 10. He gave them instructions for what to do when people don't like it. Well, they had weird these guys out a little bit. How could anybody not like it? We just broke the laws of time and space. Clearly, this thing is real. Why wouldn't everybody sign up and we're inching our way now toward an answer as we get into chapter 11. Tensions mount even more as John the Baptist who's been arrested by Herod, send some of his disciples who are like, Hey, are you actually the Messiah? And Jesus replies with a reference back to some stuff that happens in Isaiah 35 about what it's going to look like when the Messiah comes that the deaf can hear and people with leprosy or cured and the blind can receive their sight and dead people are coming back to life. And the good news is preached to the poor. And then as John's disciples go back to tell them that a bunch of people there, it kind of looks like they're sniggering about it and they're like, ah, you know, stupid John's disciples. They don't get it. We get it. And then Jesus has some pretty cool stuff about John in defense of him and then turns and offers a condemnation of the local surrounding cities where a lot of his audience was from demonstrating that he's not doing clever marketing techniques to try to make this thing go. He's willing to rebuke the people who even ostensibly like him. And at that point, he turns to his father and communicates with his father in such a way that indicates that he's holding himself out as having a unique relationship with God, the father, much like what we saw at the baptism. And this is compelling for some, but further angering to the religious leaders who don't like him very much. And those religious leaders come after him in the disciples in chapter 12. They're mad about Sabbath stuff. Then Jesus heals a guy on the Sabbath calling matter out of non matter to fix a withered away arm and everybody's amazed, but it just makes the religious leaders hate him all that much more. The goal of this exercise, working through Matthew is not to make everybody think my things and be just like me. The goal is to get Matthew in your hip pocket. Believe it or not, I'm calling this about the halfway point. We'll finish up the rest of our setting the table by looking back at everything we've done through the book of Matthew tomorrow. I'm Matt.
