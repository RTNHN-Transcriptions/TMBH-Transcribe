It's fast, fun, free, daily, deep-dye Bible, and right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy-to-use format at thetmdh.com. Hey, everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast, and yesterday I was out in the yard at the house that we just bought. I told you a while back that we've moved. This is a really big deal for us. I'm super excited about the new place. It's got all kinds of problems. We're fixing stuff up. It's messy. It smells weird, but also it's beautiful. It's cool and it's got a lot of potential. And it's ours. And so I get to be there with the people I love the most and, you know, it's home, right? Or we're working on making it home. Well, one of the features of this house that I love is there's this gigantic, enormous, ridiculous pine tree in the backyard that makes no sense to me physically. It is huge. And me saying like, oh, I can't even put my arms around it. That's not the best gauge because I'm not exactly a gangly, long-armed man. But even if I was a gangly, long-armed man, the gangliest of them all, you still can't reach around that tree. It's huge. And you'd have sap all over you and get all chopped up because it's a pine tree. So I'm out there in the backyard with this dude named Dale. It's great. He's helping me fix some stuff in the backyard that's broken. We're winding down the day and everything. And Dale is on his way out. And he's like, you know what? I really love about this place is that pine tree. I'm like, right? The pine tree. It's insane. And he's like, that's just such a great thing that years ago that pine tree ended up in the ground. And now you and I get to sit here and speak under its shade. And he's an old dude with a white beard. And he's a guy who's got some miles on the tires and he's just walked away. And I was like, dang, dude, that was really good. Also, I wonder if he knew he was referencing Bible stuff. I think Dale, who's helping me fix my deck, might be some sort of secret Bible genius. And he's just not letting on because that was a straight up nod to Old Testament language about God's blessing to the descendants of Abraham and how God did that, right? There's all this stuff in there about how the descendants of Abraham, they're going to go through the desert and they're going to go to Canaan and they are going to drink wine from vineyards. They did not plant and they're going to harvest from fields that they didn't plow. And prepare. And I know the anytime we talk about things like that, our minds are tempted to go to 21st century sensibilities about colonialism and invasion. For all of human history, there's been sort of a mad scramble for land and to get your roots down or else you sort of go away as a people group. I understand why our sensibilities are what they are now. In many ways, I probably share them. But we're talking about the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, extreme ancient times where we're in the era of nomads trying to put down roots and become a people group in the Old Testament. And so God, who seems very adept at speaking the cultural language of the moment to be understood by the people he's talking to, every time in the Bible, he invokes language about, hey, look at what you guys have. You have something you didn't earn. You are drinking wine from vineyards. You didn't plant. You're reaping harvest from fields that you didn't plow or prepare. I would never be interpreted by the original audiences like, and that's very morally complicated. No, in that era, it would be, and this is a sure sign of the blessing and favor of the one true God who promised he would do these things for us, even though we didn't earn it and who then delivered it to us through inarguably miraculous means. And so, you know, Dale's comment as we're out looking at this big giant pine tree was kind of humbling to me in the same way that God's comments to people throughout the Old Testament were meant to be humbling to them. You have this beautiful tree. You didn't really earn it. You didn't plant it. You just reaped the benefits of this beautiful blessing that was put here by God through nature, maybe somebody intentionally planted it. If so, it was a long, long time ago, and it should be humbling. It should cause you to gain perspective on that. Well, in Nehemiah chapter nine, we're getting into the Dale segment of this public prayer where everybody is supposed to be reminded of the blessings they've received, and they're supposed to repeat this back to God as they say, this is the true narrative of things. What they're saying is the true narrative of the history of everything is that we got stuff we didn't deserve because of your character, not because of ours. And we are dispensing with the collective national lie that somehow everything we've ever had is a reflection of our awesomeness. And instead, we are humbly bending the knee to acknowledge what you God have been saying all along. And that is that all the blessings we have are from you. Verse 22 of Nehemiah nine, remember, this is the whole crowd saying this prayer along with Ezra the priest, you gave them kingdoms and nations, a lotting to them, even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihan, king of Heshban and the country of Og, king of Boshan. You made their sons as numerous as the stars in the sky. And you brought them into the land that you told their fathers to enter and possess. Their sons went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites who lived in the land. You handed the Canaanites over to them along with their kings and the peoples of the land to deal with them as they pleased. They captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things. Wells already dug vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees and abundance. They ate to the full and were well nourished. They reveled in your great goodness. There's the Dale part from the pine tree in the backyard. God's been saying this all along. Everything you have is for me, but the story's been twisted along the way. Did we see a lot of the characters twisting the story along the way with their behavior, particularly in the books of First and Second Kings, all the accounts of the kings of the northern kingdom of Israel and most of the accounts of the kings of the southern kingdom of Judah highlight in First and Second Kings. This entitled arrogant selfish attitude that was embraced by the descendants of Abraham between roughly 1000 BC and roughly 586 BC. I'm talking about kind of the beginning of the United monarchy, Saul, David era, all the way up to the end of the last of the divided kingdom, that being Nebuchadnezzar's conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC. So you got roughly a 500 year window here that is described in the books of First and Second Kings, also at First and Second Samuel. And all of this mega chronicle of the history of the Jewish people for the half a millennium before the stuff we're looking at here in Ezra Nehemiah and Esther is really overwhelmingly negative and it's all born out of this sense of entitlement. So much of what they are portrayed is getting wrong flows directly from this attitude of we earned it. We did it. It's because of our great awesomeness that all of these good things happened to us in our teeny tiny little kingdom where God the whole time is saying, yeah, that starting assumption is where you're getting things wrong. I alone am your God. I alone am the one who provided and those cool things you have. Yeah, those are all from me. Those aren't really from you. Even if we look at the human hands who made them, they weren't your hands. And so once again, as we go through this big chronicling prayer of Nehemiah nine, it would be very tempting, very easy for you and me as we read it to get in a big hurry and be like, okay, yeah, they conquered the land and some things happen. That's right. I remember that from back in Joshua. We've talked about that together. Go out. Yeah, it's a great glorious victory. That's awesome. Good job to all of you. But the more careful reading points out that this is another chunk of these people in Nehemiah finally bending the knee to the true narrative and humbling themselves to acknowledge. I mean, think about our, this would be for you that the awesome stuff in their life isn't from them, that the awesome stuff in their life isn't a reflection of their own awesomeness. I don't like that. I don't want to acknowledge that. I want to like me and I want to root for me. And there's a powerful part of me that wants to imagine that any good thing that I have in my life, like that beautiful pine tree that provides shade that I get to sit under is somehow a reflection of me doing great stuff. In the grand reality of everything, anything good that is in my life, anything good that was in these people's life is a result of people who came before us and ultimately the provision of God who chose to give us existence instead of non existence, who chose to continue on the redemptive plan instead of wiping the slate clean as soon as sin and failure entered into the world. So this is one of those places where it's not just an admission that they needed to make a long time ago, you know, 2500 years ago to get things straight with God with their people group. This part of the prayer is supposed to be compelling to me and you. Maybe Dale gets it sure seems like Dale gets it, but this is not automatic for me. My impulse is to quietly, I mean, I'm socially sophisticated enough to hide my pride in this regard. To quietly imagine that if good things happen in my life, well, I probably had a pretty good amount to do with that. When the reality is that the biblical text throughout makes it really clear that in the grand scheme of things, everything good is a blessing and a gift from God and we would have nothing apart from the provision of God. And that was hard for them to admit in Nehemiah nine. And it's hard for me to admit now in truth and in reality, but it is possible to have this right perspective because Dale can do it. Nice job, Dale. High five. Hey, I want to say a quick thanks to the handful of people who signed up yesterday to be a part of this mailing that we're sending out with the Galatians notebook ahead of the next season that we have coming up on the book of Galatians. Can't wait to get back to the New Testament and see all this pays off. It's going to be great as well as the celebratory commemorative sticker to celebrate getting the book of Nehemiah in our hip pocket. It's beautiful. It's going out in this mailing as well. Thank you so much for jumping in. You know who you are. I really appreciate that. We've still got a couple of days before this mailing goes out. If you would like to receive that Galatians notebook and the super rad Nehemiah achievement unlocked sticker, you can still jump in. Make sure to have your addresses up to date on whatever platform you should choose to support. Also, you cannot support because it's podcast on the internet. And while I am super grateful to those of you who have supported or do support, you just don't have to. It's free. It'll always be free. And I'm super glad we get to do this together. The fact that you are here and listening makes it so that I get to talk about the Bible every day and think about things that I think are super important that I really care about. So thank you for making all of that happen to all of you who are hearing this. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.7600000000000002, "text": " You're listening to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.", "tokens": [50363, 921, 821,
