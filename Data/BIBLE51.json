    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Colossians. The Book of Colossians is another one of these letters is written by the Apostle Paul to a specific church. In this case, it's the church at Colossae. That's where Colossians are from. Then this is how a lot of the books that make up the middle of the New Testament are. These letters, these epistles. But this one stands out as being a little bit different because here Paul is writing to a church that he did not found and where he doesn't seem to know anybody. He says one point of contact with this church, and it's this pal of his named Apaphris. I don't know if I'm saying that right. E-P-A-P-H-R-A-S. You can pronounce that now however it makes sense to you. We don't know exactly how Paul knows Apaphris. Maybe they were in prison together, some people think, or maybe Apaphris visited him in prison. Whatever the case, Paul is in prison as he is writing this letter in Rome. And he has heard somehow about what's going on half a world away out in Asia Minor, modern day Turkey, at this little church in Colossae. And it doesn't sound like things are going very well. And so Paul is going to assert himself a little bit as the apostle to the Gentiles here to try to give some guidance to this church full of people who probably know of him, but don't know him. Now Colossae was a pretty significant city for a very, very long time. And it still had a long future ahead of it historically after this letter got delivered. It still had another thousand plus years of thriving, or maybe I should say hanging on before it finally got gobbled up by the comings and goings of history. But looking backwards Colossae was hundreds, maybe thousands of years old by the time Paul is writing this letter. It was well positioned along trade routes, so it would have factored in multiple empires who had come and gone and how they did business around Asia Minor or modern day Turkey. And Paul passed by there very, very closely on at least one of his trips. Maybe he passed through town, but it doesn't look like he did any kind of church activity there. It looks like the church thing happened there as a secondary effect perhaps of the very significant Christian growth in the city of Ephesus. Now Ephesus is on the west coast of Asia Minor on the Aegean Sea. And as I understand it, it's about a week's walk from Colossae. So Colossae is seven days straight east of Ephesus. Paul hints at another point in the Bible that the thing at Ephesus, which is the church that he loved, he hints at it went so well there that it had a ripple effect in surrounding areas. And so it seems pretty likely that Colossae is a result of what had happened there in Ephesus. Well, Colossae being at the intersection of all kinds of major highways and trade routes through multiple empires that had come and gone would mean that they would have to be very adaptive religiously to get along so well with so many different empires. They would have to do a great job of synthesizing and integrating religious beliefs from all kinds of different people in a way that wasn't threatening for the sake of doing business. Think about the way the messaging in modern media and storytelling has become more and more safe and mundane and un-nuanced, believe in yourself, don't be mean. Think about the way that has happened over the last 20 or 30 years as more and more businesses have tried to market into all corners of the world and trying to appease every cultural sensibility on earth all at the same time, even ones that are diametrated. And ones that are diametrically opposed, it makes for pretty thin, uncompelling, non-offensive milk toast storytelling. Well, it seems like in Colossae that was what was happening with religion and social norms, just a dash of this, a dash of that. Greek thought could accommodate that. You just could add a new God to the Greek cosmology of gods and they'd just be the God of this or the God of that. What sounds like the Christians in Colossae were tempted on the one hand to try to do that with Jesus. Imagine him to be a very impressive new God, the one that they would most worship. They'd be kind of like the cult of Jesus, but understand that there are cults of other things as well and those other groups might have a point. But then on the other hand, they were also under pressure in the same way that the Galatian Church, this would be the neighboring region to where Colossae is, in the same way that the Galatian Church was under pressure from those Judaizers, those Jewish Christians who came up north and they were like, no, you got to do all the Jewish stuff. You got to eat the food the same way we eat it. You got to do the festivals the same way we do it. You got to get all those adult men circumcised. That way everybody will know that they are doing the ancient covenant that God gave to Abraham to show that these are people who are set apart and holy for God. As soon as the knives come out, just like in Galatia, I'm sure the people of Colossae were like, maybe somebody should contact Paul and find out. It seems like kind of final before we actually start cutting on things. Maybe we just figure out how the religion is actually supposed to work and just make sure. So I imagine, or maybe it's kind of fun to imagine, that that is the occasion. That is what prompted the reach out to Paul in the first place. Maybe it was just a paphorous and he felt concerned for his home church and he contacted Paul in prison. Either way, Paul graciously agrees to write this letter to a bunch of people he doesn't know to encourage them regarding the uniqueness, the singularity and the supremacy of Christ. To say, Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. You don't need to do the rules that the Judaizers are trying to get you to follow. You got to do that stuff. But further, Jesus is not a God among many gods. Those are all fake gods. This is the one true God. He is the image of the invisible God, the real one. So don't integrate any of that other stuff at all. Just Christ plus nothing. That's the way you got to go. And he executes that in this letter to the Colossians by opening in the normal way with greetings and an expression of thanks for the good things. He's heard about what's going on there. But then he gets down to business by opening with one of the most important theological tour de forces of the entire New Testament in chapter 1 verses 15 through 23. And I could try to summarize it all, but you know, it would be faster and better would be to just read it. But as I read it here, have your antenna out for all of the ways that Paul is overtly and subtly saying you don't need all of this other stuff. Christ reigns supreme. He is over and above all else. Okay. Starting in verse 15. He that is Christ is the image of the invisible God, the first born over all creation. For by him, all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities. All things were created by him and for him. He's before all things and in him, all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning and the first born from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy for God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood shed on the cross. Now he pivots into the implications of that very briefly. Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your mind because of your evil behavior, but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you wholly in his sight without blemish and free from accusation. If you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you have heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. We almost don't even really need to cover anything else in this book because you get it. That is the thesis statement. That is the theology that undergirds all of this. That should be enough in and of itself to clarify all the other questions that are plaguing the Christians here in Colossae. From here on out, the rest of the book really is just Paul saying in light of that, this is pretty obvious. And so the next section is reminiscent of what we got back in Galatians, the stuff about the Judaizers coming up north and trying to make everybody do Jewish things. In order to be a Christian and signal that they were part of the family of God, Paul's response is shorter and simpler here. But the gist is, again, that Jesus is the fulfillment of all of that stuff and that God has made a new family of faith and replaced the old dead heart. They can't help itself with a new life and a new heart that is in Jesus, made alive in Jesus. And this multi-ethnic family was always the plan going all the way back to Abraham. And indeed, if Jesus is the true God who is supreme over all else, supreme over rulers and authorities and thrones and culture and religion and everything else, then such a God who is ruler of all the world and all the peoples must be represented in the church. This always had to be a multi-ethnic, multicultural family of faith or else it's just another regional God. But this isn't just another regional God. This is the real one, the actual one. The point is Christ Jesus, God in the flesh is the chief reality. Indeed, he holds creation, existence and reality together as its author and as its sustainer. And therefore, he defines what reality is and that trumps even the things that the people in Colossae might imagine were the bedrock of social assumptions. No, Christ is the foundation and the bedrock of social assumptions according to Paul in this book. When you visualize the book of Colossians, picture Jesus, the image of the invisible God, when you think about the theme, reflect on the nature and the supremacy of Jesus. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go back and read chapter 1 verses 15 through 23 a few times over for yourself.
