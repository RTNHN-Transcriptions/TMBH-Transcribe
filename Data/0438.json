Hi, Jeff. Hey, what's up? So remember the other day when I was like, hey, someday I might get sick and my voice might not work. And then would you please cover the podcast on that day if that day ever comes? Yeah. Today is that day. It should be easy though, because today is just that simple little passage about the 12 disciples being told that they're going to sit on thrones and judge all of Israel later. Right? Yeah, that sounds really basic. Yeah, I think we can do that. Perfect. Should be super easy. Okay. I'm going to go ice my voice and let you get it then, pal. Okay. We'll see what happens. All right. Thanks, buddy. Bye. Hey, gang. It's the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and I'm Jeff. And yeah, this is a little weird, but it is great to have the opportunity to do it. I'm too filling for Matt while his voice recuperates. There's a little bit of sarcasm in that phone call because the passage Matt gave me is a bit of a minefield and has been pretty controversial over the years. But before we get in any of that, I want to say there is something that Matt and I share in common that is a love for the great game of baseball. I know not everybody's a big baseball fan, so I'm not going to get into too many of the details. But I do want to talk to you today about one of my favorite players of all time, a guy named Ricky Henderson. Ricky Henderson was unique. He was a weird dude. He always talked about himself in the third person. And even when he was at bat, he would talk to himself and he would say things like Ricky's the best. Ricky's going to get a home run. Ricky's awesome. Ricky's going to get a hit. And the umpire and the catcher would they didn't know what to do with that because they just hear him talking to himself. But Ricky Henderson is the all time leader in baseball in run scored and stolen bases. And his stolen base record probably will never be equaled. There's so many great stories about Ricky Henderson that he signed a million dollar bonus check and then he didn't cash it. He framed it. So at the end of the year, the Oakland A's were missing a million dollars in their budget. That's the kind of guy Ricky was. My wife worked for a while in a vision therapy office. She got to learn a little bit about vision therapy and a lot of times it's for kids to be developing the muscles around their eyeballs so they can see things. And anyway, within the vision therapy world, it's widely circulated that Ricky Henderson has a unique binocular deficiency. He has this thing called strabismus. It's the ability or inability for the two eyes to come together to focus on one image and occasionally one of the eyes will wander. It comes out as lazy eye or cross eye. And we don't know if he was ever officially diagnosed with this by a vision therapist. But it does explain possibly how he was able to steal so many bases because he could allow an eye to look at something different than his other eye. So I can just picture him standing at first base, looking at home, looking at the picture and then letting his eye wander to second base and being able to see all that at once. I don't know if it's true or not. A lot of Ricky Henderson stories are apocryphal, but I do trust my wife. But similarly, I think what Jesus is teaching the disciples here in Matthew, coming up here into Matthew 19 and moving on into Matthew 20, is this concept of if there's a kingdom of God and a kingdom of the world, is it possible? To have one eye in each kingdom is a possible to see the kingdom of the world. That's all around us that we're used to, but then also catch a glimpse and see what the kingdom of God will offer. And Matt's been pointing out throughout all the text of Matthew how the disciples concept of what the kingdom of God offers isn't quite what Jesus is trying to teach them. Their concept of the kingdom of God has been things like, well, let's rain fire down on the Samaritans or when are the armies going to come to destroy Rome or when you're going to baptize with fire instead of just hang out with sinners all day. And there was an expectation that the coming of the kingdom of God would come with his power and this reward and this sense of we finally get what we're due and we're vindicated. And so far what Jesus has been doing is not that. He's been caring for the outsiders. He's been talking about suffering and dying. And he just told the disciples, it's impossible for anyone to enter the kingdom of God. Unless God's the one who makes it happen. So there's this constant reminder of maybe their perspective on the kingdom of God isn't right and they need to count the cost of what is going on in the kingdom of the world that they have to walk away from or that they have to leave behind or that isn't going to pay off. And this is kind of the tension in Matthew 19 with the rich young ruler, with the camel in the eye of the needle, with the question of who then can be saved. But then Peter pivots again here in verse 27 with a question about rewards in the kingdom. Matthew 19, 27 and 28, Peter answered him, we have left everything to follow you. What then will there be for us? Jesus said to them, truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel. Now in context, this is the same conversation Jesus is having with the disciples where they just asked the question of salvation, who then can be saved. But Peter is still mulling in his mind everything that just happened with the rich young ruler and he has a different question. His question isn't about salvation, it's about reward. Okay, well that guy didn't leave his stuff to follow you. And so he doesn't get the kingdom, but we did. So what's in it for us? I think it's really easy to look at that and be like, okay, Peter, calm down. You're getting a little cheeky. Jesus is about to rebuke you and smack you down. But interestingly, Jesus doesn't rebuke Peter. He actually answers him. He gives him a glimpse of what the kingdom of God actually will be. And this is a rare thing. It's going to come up a little more here as we get through the rest of Matthew. But this is one of those moments where Jesus pulls the veil back and he doesn't rebuke Peter for asking, I think a legitimate question. We have done this and Jesus knows they've done it. They did leave their nets. They did follow him. He knows their future. He knows that they are going to die for him. And so they're saying, well, is there something on the other side? And Jesus answers. He says, actually guys, yeah, when this thing is all done and the son of man and there he's talking about himself, he's using a phrase from the book of Daniel, which is about the divinity and the majesty and the power and the ruling authority of the one who is to come. So he says, when the son of man is on his glorious throne, you 12 will also be on thrones. And he says, you will judge the 12 tribes of Israel. That's not an accident. The 12, the 12 tribes of Israel, 12 apostles, clearly there's a connection there that Matthew is trying to get us to think about that Jesus is trying to get the disciples to think about. What's going on here is he's talking specifically to the 12 apostles. He's not saying this reward is for everybody. He's saying, Peter says, we have done this. And Jesus is saying, yes, you 12 will get these thrones. Now in the next verse, he talks about anyone who leaves things to follow him will get a reward. But here it's this 12 thing. And when the world is the throne signify. I think at the very least, what Jesus is saying is to the apostles, you 12 will have places of honor in the kingdom. But then there's also this language about judging the 12 tribes of Israel. And that's where this gets really tricky. Is this passage teaching that the apostles and thereby the church is going to replace Israel and the 12 tribes? And so they will sit in judgment as a different group. Or is this implying that it is just a continuation and these guys are already Jewish and this is just that they will have a place of honor in their own kinsmen. What does it mean for Israel as a people vis a vis the church, especially when it comes to like end time stuff. And there's a lot of great thought out there. A lot of books written. I am certainly not an expert on this. But I think that word that they will judge, I think that has to mean something. And I like what Matt has been putting into all these episodes that Jesus is talking about a family of faith, people who get to be a part of this kingdom, kingdom citizens. And I think in this new kingdom, these 12 guys are important and they are pillars and they are the leaders. And there is a special place of honor for them. And I think that is what Jesus is reminding them of that that day is coming. Now you might be thinking, wait a minute, Jeff, isn't Judas still one of the 12? There's no way he gets a throne, right? And I would say, I'm not sure how this all works, but I think we can take the collective teaching of scripture and how Judas is replaced in Acts chapter one by Matthias or maybe some people think the apostle Paul is really number 12 to replace Judas. I think it's safe to say this will all work out with the right number of apostles on the right number of thrones. But good question. Ultimately, though, I think this must have been a mind blowingly encouraging thing for Peter. Jesus never really had a problem rebuking Peter. He even called him Satan at one point. So to not be rebuked for this kind of question, but instead to be given a glimpse of the eternal kingdom of God, the payoff, wouldn't it be great if we could get a glimpse of that every once in a while to be able to have Ricky Henderson eyes where, okay, I know what I see in front of me, but if I just look over here, I can see that too. And I just love that here in Matthew 19, we get that glimpse. I think it's a hopeful thing. I think it's an encouragement. And I think it's a reminder that there is a good end to all that is coming and especially for these disciples for all that is coming pretty soon. I'd like to think that they held on to this type of comment from Jesus and really held it close to their heart. Hopefully Matt will be back soon with a renewed voice. Until next time, I'm Jeff.
