    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Zephaniah. I got a whole bunch of friends who are engineers and into physics and stuff, and I'm sure they know the name of this particular phenomenon. I don't know the name, but I can describe it. Maybe you've seen it. It's the deal where you see somebody going down a hill way too fast on like a skateboard, and things look good at first, but then you notice that they're starting to sway back and forth. They're starting to wobble back and forth. That weird speed wobble thing is some kind of oscillation. And once that speed wobble and the correction and the over-correction and the correction and the over-correction starts, it's no longer a question of if that kid is going to wipe out. The question is, when is that kid going to wipe out and how ugly is it going to be when it happens? You can see the calamity coming from a really long ways away. Likewise, Zephaniah is one of the last prophets to the southern kingdom of Judah. He's operating in the last quarter of the 600s, and that speed wobble has already started with the people of Judah. It's coming apart. It's going downhill too fast. They're not going to be able to get it back under control, but Zephaniah gets thrust into that situation anyway to try to speak truth and see if somehow the prophetic word of the Lord through him can bring about some kind of correction. And if you go back and look at 2 Kings, you can see that it looks like it kind of worked there for just a minute after a whole bunch of really lousy kings have been in charge for 50-ish years, along comes this kid Josiah. And Josiah has this encounter with the book of the law, and his heart is broken over what they've gotten wrong, and he starts engaging in all of these reforms, and there's this moment at the very end of the several hundred-year run of the southern kingdom of Judah where it looks just for a second. Like maybe they will defy the odds and be that one exception where the speed wobble starts, but they pull out of it somehow. But then they don't. Josiah dies in an ill-advised battle, and the stench of what is wrong with Judah and the whole southern kingdom is so systemic. It's so worked into the fabric at this point that they just can't clean it up. They can't pull out of the speed wobble, even though everybody watching knows they're in speed wobble mode, and even though they know we're in speed wobble mode, they can't fix it. Zephaniah is a guy who saw this coming from a very long ways away, and he was uniquely positioned to do so, not just because he was a prophet, but he was royal blood. This guy was the great-grandson of King Hezekiah. Hezekiah was a good king. But what that means is Zephaniah is different than any of these other prophets we've been seeing. He doesn't just know how to mingle in the court life and with the fancy people. He's one of them, which means he's giving up a tremendous amount, much like Josiah, to say, this isn't going to work. We need to admit the situation that we're in, and we need to repent. But despite how unpopular that no doubt must have been in his circle of acquaintances, he still said it, and he still called all of those fancy people and all of their fancy outfits who were doing the noble court life thing to very public repentance. And depending on when we understand this story that was recorded in the book of Zephaniah to have occurred, it's possible that this is part of what inspired what went right during the reign of King Josiah. It may well be that what we're getting in the book of Zephaniah is something that kind of looks like the second half of the book of Jonah, where the king of Nineveh is like, hey, who knows? Maybe God will relent and show mercy on us, and then God does. But as we discussed in our conversation about the book of Nahum, it's not very long. And Nineveh is like, yeah, forget it. We're going back to the way we used to do things, and then they meet their ruin. Well, that's how it plays out here as well. In the middle of the speed wobble, it looks like Judah responds to this message and says in so many words, maybe God will relent. Here's the call to repentance from Zephaniah in chapter two after a scathing pronouncement of judgment through all of chapter one against Judas is gathered together, gather together, a shameful nation before the appointed time arrives and that day sweeps on like chaff before the fierce anger of the Lord comes upon you before the day of the Lord's wrath comes upon you. There's that day of the Lord concept again. Seek the Lord all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands, seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lord's anger. So it really does have a similar feel back to the book of Jonah when we see a prophecy that worked. And by that, I don't mean like one where there was a prediction and then it came true. We're seeing a lot of that. By that, I mean a prophet went and said you need to repent and then someone actually did and then God relented. But when you go back and look through all of the charges in chapter one against Judah, it's the same stuff we've been seeing everywhere else. It's this indictment of an evil that has gone so deep and that is so beyond political solution. And as we keep observing this pattern through the words of all of these different prophets calling out this systemic culture wide evil, the sense that we're getting is that all of this evil is interconnected. It's like there's so many little points of wrongdoing and darkness and injustice between people, broken relationships, broken trust that eventually that has a cumulative effect. And the consequences, the destruction of the soul of that society or to run even further with our little ongoing metaphor, the crash at the end of the speed wobble. Well, after that called repentance at the beginning of chapter two, then you get an allusion to some great superpower that is going to come and steamroll everybody, all of the neighboring kingdoms that have been a pain in the butt for Judah, they're getting steamrolled. Judah's getting steamrolled. Heck, Assyria is getting steamrolled. There's even another prophecy in here against Nineveh. I mean, this one was probably a bit of a crowd pleaser for everyone. Like, all right, well, we're going to crash and burn, but Nineveh's going down to, I mean, check out this language about Nineveh. This is the carefree city that lived in safety. She said to herself, I am and there is none besides me. What a ruin. She has become a layer for wild beasts, all who pass by her scoff and shake their fists. And as we talked about when we were looking at the book of Nahum, that's exactly the fate that fell Nineveh, which fell so hard in the sands of the desert that it was completely lost to history for another 2300 years after the event. And I is predicting here and Nahum was predicting in his book. Then in chapter three, we get a denunciation of all of the corrupt lousy leaders of Jerusalem for their dereliction of duty and lack of character. Then we get this little nugget that is reminiscent of Joel, the theme over there of God judging not just one nation here or there, but the nations in general God bringing justice to the whole great big mess. And then we get our pivot to the optimistic part, the part that we're always hoping we get at the end of these Old Testament prophets. And so often we do get it. And in this case, the encouraging part is reminiscent of what we get back in Micah chapter four, where remember Micah was using that imagery about there's going to be this mountain, the temple and all of the nations are going to be like, what are we doing? We should go to Jerusalem and learn from them and effectively worship their God. And the prophet Micah says that day is indeed coming. Well, all those people from the nations who are coming their Gentiles. And that's a follow through on God's promise to Abraham back in the day that he would be a great nation that he would be blessed by God, but then all the nations would be blessed by the descendants of Abraham. Now that is starting to come into focus all the more. And the last bit of chapter three is just beautiful. It's one of my favorite parts of all of the Old Testament prophetic books because we get this blissful picture of this utopia where God is dwelling among his people and they're all together. And all the stupid broken stuff is gone kind of like Micah and Isaiah say about like the end of war and we're going to take our weapons of war and we're going to reshape them into things that are productive. It's that kind of image, but we also get imagery like we get from Joel chapter two where there's that talk about God's spirit being among all the people who've come from all the corners of the world and God's spirit is among them like it used to live in the temple like it used to live in the tabernacle in the Ark of the Covenant. Now it lives in people. Well, this is a degree of intimacy and closeness and unbroken fellowship with God that we've only seen very briefly at the very beginning all the way back in the garden. And now we're getting these hints that we can look forward to that again someday in the future. That's exciting. And the further we get into the Old Testament and the more of these indictments from the prophets we see, the more we come to realize that is the only way forward is to be that close and that connected to God to the true King. And so even though Zephaniah predicts what pretty much all the prophets are predicting whether they're predicting the fall of the north or prophesying to the south and predicting the fall of the south. They're all saying there's a judgment coming. It's gone on too long. It's in the fabric that can't be sorted out easily. There's no neat solution. This is going to require judgment. We're too far into the speed wobble. We're going to crash. It's coming quickly. But the idea is that this judgment is not the end game. The judgment is a necessary step in God remaking things to get us closer to the arrival of this King from the line of David who we've been hearing about in other books of the Old Testament. And closer to this new Eden, this new union with God where people from all the nations come together and experience this amazing thing. When you visualize Zephaniah picture that speed wobble where the crash at the end is a foregone conclusion, when you think about the theme reflect on judgment of this moment to clear the way for a new and better one that is to come. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, make sure to catch chapter three versus eight through the end of it. And with that, congratulations. That is another level up for you and for me. My five nice job next time around. We got the book of Haggai. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
