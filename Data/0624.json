I got a gun. It's right above my fireplace. I'm looking at it right now. It's awesome, looking. It doesn't so much shoot like bullets per se. It's not one of the functions it still does. It's pretty old, but it does the secondary function of a gun really well, which is look awesome and be above my fireplace. This gun belonged to a guy named Johnny, who fought in the Civil War. It's a big, awesome looking old woodstock rifle. And old Johnny, when he was a super old guy, taught a super young guy named Jim, my grandpa, how to shoot on this rifle. That's a pretty special thing. But you're smart. I mean, you know that if I'm telling you a story about a gun that's on the wall here in my room, there's probably a reason. There's probably going to be a payoff later on. And if I just stop talking about the gun right now and rolled on to some other things and kept going, you'd be like, yeah, but at some point, remember the thing at the beginning about the gun? There's going to be a thing because you got to pay that off. Or else you just want to edit the part out about the gun because there was no reason and you were wasting our time. It's actually a name for this literary rule. And it's the old Chekhov's gun rule. See, it's the name of the literary technique. It has gun in it. So I went with like an actual, I went with an actual gun. I feel like you were following me and I might be over explaining right now. The Chekhov's gun rule is all about payoff. You don't have an ice pick that gets mentioned in the story that's sitting there in the corner of the room unless that ice pick is going to be used probably in some way that's very, very violent. Later on, you set stuff up. You pay stuff off. This is one of the most basic rules of telling a story of writing. It's satisfying. It works. And part of the reason this rule exists is not just for suspense and foreshadowing. Part of the reason the rule exists is because theoretically in a well put together story, you're not ready for the full payoff emotionally and electually. The author hasn't taken you on the journey they want to take you on yet. So they can introduce the concept. There's a gun that looks like this. It's right there. Okay, it's cool. There are also some characters in the room. You don't know them very well yet. Okay, there are also some themes we're introducing. We haven't really worked those three out. Oh, okay. But then when we come back to that gun later on, now we're ready for a payoff that would not have been effective if whatever role the gun was going to play in the story got paid off early. Instead, by having it pay off much later, the audience is now prepped. The audience is now positioned to receive the full benefit of all of the meaning that goes into that. Likewise, Matthew is a well structured piece of literature. He did a really great job. I'd give him an A plus even. But as we get into the home stretch of Matthew, these pay offs are coming so fast. But here we are at the end of Matthew chapter 25. This represents the conclusion of the fifth great speech around which the book of Matthew is structured. In line of all that, here are the big pay offs that I see Matthew chapter 25 at the end with the sheep and the goat stuff, the judgment and the arrival of the son of man. There's a huge payoff here on just the theme of reckoning in general. The Old Testament indicates that there's one coming and not just like you all are in trouble now, God's back, but like a straightening out of everything that's not just and wrong and broken and dinged up. It's just a fixing of all of the stuff that has gone afoul, a settling of all of the debates by the only one who could ever settle it. That is the trajectory of history in Judaism, in Christianity. It's affirmed by Jesus. This is something that is part of the story. The kingdom view of history is that such a reckoning, such an end game is coming. Indeed, all of chapters 24 and 25 have been about that. But it's not like this is catching us by surprise. This theme is present in the way that Matthew harkens back to the Old Testament in the first two chapters. It's present when John the Baptist's message is repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. It's present when Jesus follows with the same message. He sends the disciples out with the same message. Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The idea is like it's actually at hand. And the actual right response is to turn from the things that are not kingdom value-ish and not kingdom-ish at all and turn to the things that are because there's kind of a timeline here. There is an end game. There is a reckoning. There is some kind of judgment and sorting out that is coming. We don't get all the specifics on it until chapter 25 with the sheep and the goats stuff. We looked at the last couple of days. But we do see hints of it, especially at the end of the Sermon on the Mount in chapter 7 where you get the stuff about the narrow and wide gates, the wise and foolish builders and the stuff about the people who show up and they're like, oh, we're doing a sorting out. Well, cool. We did a whole bunch of things in your name, God. But in that story, this hypothetical, the judge, the king is like, I don't know you. And they get sent away to some kind of rejection, some kind of punishment. It's kind of scary. But well, that's just hanging there for several chapters. And then boom, check offs gun. It pays off with a more specific description of what's actually going on there at the end of Matthew 25 with the sheep and the goats stuff because if he paid the whole thing off there at the end of the Sermon on the Mount, it would look weird because the casual viewer doesn't know Jesus that well yet. He doesn't know the heart of the Pharisees and the competing religious establishment understanding of things well enough yet to be like, whoa, Jesus is super definitely like mega right. And look at their hearts. Look what they're doing. That's, that's what it looks like to totally get it wrong and have your head so far up the backside of your weird religious rules and culty cultural stuff that you don't even remember that your religion is supposed to make you like decent to people or something that you're supposed to look out for people who are vulnerable and oppressed and outsiders and that you in your own way are vulnerable and oppressed and an outsider and that you need God's grace to look out for you. Like it becomes so evident with the interim between the end of the Sermon on the Mount and where we're at in Matthew 25 that Jesus is right and does these things right and that the Pharisees are wrong and don't get these things right. That now that the check offs gun is firing here at the end of 25 and we're getting a better look at what this judgment actually is, we're more positioned as readers to be like, yeah, I guess I guess I'm on the side of the king here even though this is a little bit scary. I get why he's qualified to make the judgment. I get why he is making the judgment. I get the eternal consequences of what's being said here. I also understand the immediate context consequences of what's going on here regarding the failure of the religious structure that was in place and competing with Jesus. So the reckoning theme is a huge check offs gun payoff. Maybe slightly more subtle but still very present is the payoff on Jesus' affection for the vulnerable epitomized by little children and in Matthew 18 Matthew 19 people are like, yeah, kids, whatever. But Jesus is like, whoa, no, no, no, don't deny them. Let the little ones come to me. Any models care and compassion toward them, something that would have been wildly counter-cultural in a public setting like that. And additionally, you recall in Matthew 18, he follows that with a pretty stern warning about anybody who would hurt or trip up or falsely teach one of those little ones. Then you recall after Jesus comes into town and all the kids are like, ah, this is the son of David and the Pharisees are like, tell him to stop saying that. But Jesus is like, I don't know. You got that Bible verse or whatever. It's like, let the little children come to me and don't hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these. All of those references to the little children are glances above the fireplace at a check-off's gun. And now it really fires when Jesus is like, surprise, guess what the judgment is going to be about at least in part. It's going to be about what did you do to these little ones that I entrusted you with? Did you care for the stranger for the person in need, the one who was sick, the one who was in prison, the one who was hungry, all of which is both explicit and literal and also a metaphor for what it looks like to internalize the values of the kingdom and to give away the good things that God has given the kingdom citizen. Did you do that or did you not? And the payoff is pretty evident. The other big payoff I'm seeing here is that theme of entering the kingdom. I guess I alluded to that in Matthew 7, that enter through the narrow gate versus enter through the wide gate. There's also the stuff in Matthew 5 where Jesus is talking about entering the kingdom and you'd need a righteousness that surpasses anything that anyone could possibly imagine indicating that that would need to be a righteousness that is from God and that is apart from the law, something even bigger than what you could muster. Even if you had exemplary self-control for your whole life, in Matthew 19, you get the rich young ruler who wants to know about how to enter into the kingdom. Jesus again talks about the little children and them entering into the kingdom. And we've kind of been wondering, well, what is that righteousness that you referenced back there in chapter 5 that's greater than the Pharisees? How do you enter into the kingdom? And at least here in chapter 25, it looks like, well, belief in the king, bending the knee to the king in the form of the Lord's Prayer as we've looked at it, and then internalizing the values of the king and participating in his kingdom in some way. And what order does that happen? Well, I think the larger text of scripture indicates that God does all the work and that it's by grace and not by works that people are saved. But it also looks like there's supposed to be some kind of evidence that this new servant of the king has internalized the values of the kingdom. So while Jesus and the rest of the New Testament says a lot more about this basic orientation of submission to the king and what it looks like after someone bends the knee to the king in terms of entering the kingdom, it's still getting something that is clearly meant to be a contrast before the humble follower of God who humbles himself or herself to go and do things that are kingdom oriented here in Matthew chapter 25 versus the pride and stubbornness and indifference toward kingdom values in the weak and the vulnerable and the outsider and the little children that you see on behalf of the religious leadership. It looks like Jesus is saying, like, there should be some kind of thing that the judge should be able to look at the king should be able to look at and be like, ah, you were vested with talents and this is a return. There's evidence that you internalize the values of my kingdom as opposed to there's no evidence for that whatsoever. You did the exact opposite of the values of the kingdom. You lived and believed and worshiped in the exact opposite way of what the king and the kingdom were all about. I think those are pretty remarkable payoffs. I think there are even more payoffs here, but I just wanted to get this in because I want to be careful not to read the end of Matthew chapter 25 is just a standalone thing completely divorced from its context where Jesus is like, hey, be nice to poor people. And if you do, like heaven for you and if you don't, whoa, whoa, get rid of these fires of hell, there's a lot more going on here and these themes are much more robust than what can be covered in the 15 verses in the passage we're looking at right now. Instead, these things prove to be very exemplary of a much larger set of themes and story that have been going on throughout the book of Matthew and that are not even fully paid off yet. And we will get to that as we chip away a little bit further on these last few chapters tomorrow, we land the plane once and for all on the Olivet Discourse of Matthew chapters 24 and 25. And that is on to chapter 26. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
