Bring shame and disgrace to my family name as a fan for generations to come, kind of annihilated. It was ugly and I did start getting texts from my friends who were fans of rival teams. And Winter lose one of the things I really like to do after watching my team player, in this case hearing about how poorly my team played, is I like to go to myohyreport.com which is the blog about the Denver Broncos and I read this little column they do called winners and losers. And it's like three losers and two winners from yesterday's game against the Chiefs. And they go through and they're like, hey, these three guys blew it and got things wrong. And these two guys got some stuff right and they're showing optimism and promise. And what I like about it is that it's just a very honest assessment of where the team is at. Likewise, in Matthew 11, Jesus takes the second half of the chapter to effectively give us a winners and losers column, a commentary, an evaluation, a very honest one of the results of how the whole big open world quest that he sent his disciples out on in chapter 10 worked out. They went out with the message of the kingdom in hand. They went out with apparently access to even miraculous stuff that was supposed to point people in Northern Galilee to the reality that Jesus is actually the king in this kingdom that Jesus described in the Sermon on the Mount is the truest, realest thing that you're invited and you should be a part of this thing. And in this winners and losers column that we get from Jesus, apparently, Corzine, Beth Sata and Capernaum performed very badly. They saw the stuff and they just missed it and Jesus has some pretty harsh things to say about them in the first half of this winners and losers column. But in the second half of the winners and losers column, he gets into the winners and it transitions in Matthew 11, 25 where it says, at that time, Jesus said, I praise you father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you've hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children. Yes, father, for this was your good pleasure. There's an interesting little linguistic cue here that I want to talk about before we get into the actual stuff Jesus said that Matthew uses when he says at that time. Sometimes Matthew gives us very straight chronological cues to say Jesus was in this house, then he walked outside and this other thing happened. At other points, Matthew's a little bit more vague about the chronology. Matthew uses transitional cues to say, hey, the thematic ideological, theological material of the last block of thought is now going to be picked up in the next block of thought. And you need to think about what happened in the last block of thought in this next block of thought because the two ideas are as inexorably linked together as the winners section and the losers section is in the winners and losers articles that I like to read after the Broncos routinely get annihilated on a weekly basis. So the phrase at that time, according to somebody I know who is miles better than me at the original Greek language being employed here could also be translated as it was about that time or around that time. But my understanding is that the literal phraseology of it was about that time is not the most important thing here. The most important thing is to notice that the way Matthew uses that phrase, it's as connective tissue between two parts of the same idea or two contrasting things that you have to think of together again, like the winners and losers. So we can't think of what is happening from verse 25 on, on its own, it has to be thought of in contrast to what it looks like to miss the message of the kingdom that we looked out with all the wodie you, Corzine and Vesseta and all of that last week. So okay, at that time, Jesus said, I praise you father, Lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children. There are probably two reactions that are immediately springing to mind for a lot of you and let's just start with the first one. What? What gives? If everybody needs the kingdom and Jesus so much, why would you make it? There's just somebody what went to college? They don't get to know this. They don't get access. I mean, it looks like Jesus is saying God is actively blocking people or boxing people out from this thing. Then that seems really dark. Sometimes you know I like to rhetorically set up attention and then be like, oh, but think about this. Maybe there's not so much of attention there after all. This isn't one of those times. It is just fine if you find it troubling that God, even though he is master of all things, sovereign of all things in charge of everything as he is held out by the text, is just fine for you to look at that and be like, no, I don't like that. I don't like the idea of God opening the eyes of some and then implicitly it can be assumed that he did not open the eyes of others or explicitly. It could even be like what Jesus is saying here that God somehow actively hid these things from the wise and learned, but revealed them to the little children. Now, look, nothing against little children. I think we're all for the little children. It's just why are we picking on the college people so much? That seems a little bit mean. Ten years ago me, maybe would have tried to fix this for you. But right now me is more content to say, oh, no, that kind of friction is just a cost to doing business if the arrangement that the Bible says exists between a perfect sovereign all knowing all powerful God and finite flawed, not all knowing, not all powerful people. If that relationship is going to happen, this is a natural point of friction, especially if the nature of the relationship right now is a God who is in the process of redeeming a world that is broken and flawed and sinful. This passage is going to rub us a lot more the wrong way if we come at it with the theological assumption that people are good, that people maybe at times have problems, but that's all born out of ignorance. No abiding deep material, sinful flaw in the heart of humans is just all people are basically good. And this is mean because God is not giving access to something that everyone should have equal access to. But if you go with what I think is the more biblical read on the nature of humankind and the human situation, the human condition, maybe the passage isn't quite as shocking. The more biblical read is everybody's pretty screwed up. It's not just like, Oh, if I knew a few more things, I'd be good. Like, no, no one is good, not even one. I'm not saying that people don't ever do something redemptive or good. I'm not saying I don't like other people or don't like myself. But again, just looking at the biblical text, it certainly advances the idea that people exist in a state of disaster, a state of judgment, a state of fallenness. And that if God is opening the eyes of somebody to this thing, that would be a proactive, active grace. So maybe it's a little less shocking when we consider that what's happening here is not that God is keeping people out of something they are entitled to, but rather that God is opening the eyes of some who by world standards aren't that impressive. But by kingdom standards are exactly the kind of people who were celebrated under the values of the kingdom. I think it's perfectly valid for both the person who says, yeah, I think there's a God and there's a God behind the Bible or for the person who says, I don't think there's any God, but this is a really interesting philosophical thought exercise to work through what the Bible teaches. I think for either of those parties to look at this and say, I think it would have been cooler if God was just like, I declare universal amnesty for everyone for everything, whether you sign up or not, whether you like me or not, whether you follow me or not. But that isn't what the text teaches. What the text describes is a God who is holy and flawless and perfect and who is in the process of redeeming, not just placing his friendly words of affirmation upon, but redeeming like fixing, like scrubbing the yuck and brokenness and fallenness off of stuff that is mired in sin and yuck and a state of total desperation. And once again, in this passage, we run into the old yet can't have the tiger without the clause maxim. A God who is perfect enough and powerful enough to redeem that which is broken must also be a God of such tremendous power and who is so different from us and above those of us who need the rescuing that when you really look at that power and authority and the implications of it, it's going to be kind of freaky the same way you would admire the beauty of the tiger. But you don't really get the tiger without the clause. The power is part of the equation as to what makes the tiger awe inspiring. And last thought here on that discomfort that some of us might feel at the idea of God closing the eyes of some and opening the eyes of others, just bear in mind that in verse 26, he wraps up saying, yes, father, for this was your good pleasure. For you and me and for human theologians throughout history, some of us are really troubled by this and we've really wrestled with how to reconcile God's sovereignty and his power and his tigeriness with the way we feel about ourselves and what we imagine to be just or right from a human perspective. But Jesus isn't anticipating that argument here at all. He doesn't feel the pressure of that argument. He's not apologizing for the way his father has handled his business. He's saying, praise to you, father. Yes, father, for this was your good pleasure, not even just a necessity that the father would behave in such a way, but his good pleasure. This is what he wanted. This is how he wanted to do it. Look at that. That's the getting off point for some of us where we're like, I just, I don't like a God like that. I'm not in charge. That didn't write the Bible. I don't own it. Like I'm not even sure I read all of it right. I'm trying real hard, but I don't know. We're gaming it out together. I understand that might be the getting off point for some people. But if we really are dealing with the sovereign of everything who is right about everything and all powerful, and we see that that being is not at all troubled by how that being has behaved in response to human brokenness and sin, maybe we stay in a little bit longer and see how this thing unfolds because there is a flip side to it. And the flip side is that once we get past the potential troublingness we just talked about, we get into again, a repetition of the beauty of the values of the kingdom. I mean, think about the upside downness of this, the completely harmless, unimpressive, not that valued by society, little street urchin is celebrated here and given access to the kingdom. Remember, given access to the kingdom doesn't just mean you can sneak inside the gates and be a street urchin inside the kingdom. Uh-uh. Here in the kingdom, you are transformed from whatever you were to a child, a son, a daughter, an heir, an agent, an ambassador of the kingdom, salt and light, a preservative with a role and responsibility. There are no street urchins in the kingdom. Everybody is an heir of valued citizen who has that value because that value has been conferred on them by the actual king of the entire kingdom. And so the uppity, the impressive, the well-educated, the elite, the people who get celebrated and get rich in world kingdom values, not so here. No, we shouldn't be that startled by what Jesus is saying at all here in the second half of the winners and losers column. Rather, we should say, well, if you read the sermon on the Mount, this is exactly in keeping with it. And the further we work through Matthew, the more we see the first shall be last, the last shall be first upside downness of the priorities and the values of the kingdom. Look, this is one of those passages is kind of a Rorschach test. Some people of goodwill and intellectual honesty are going to come to this passage and what they're going to see in that ink blot is a great big hang up about the character of God and his power and authority to judge and whether or not they think that is just. Other people are going to come to this passage and they're going to look at the ink blot and they're going to be like, Oh, look at the beautiful values of that kingdom. Look at the way this takes all of the burden and weight off of me. A weight I couldn't possibly sustain anyway. It takes the burden of me trying to earn my way to siege the gates or climb over the walls of this kingdom that I could never possibly get over anyway. And instead, the gates are just opened by the God who made the first move and invited me into this thing. I like that deal so much better. The values of the kingdom are so depressurizing and beautiful. The invitation of the kingdom is beautiful. I love that that ink blot looks that way to me. Well, look, you read the ink blot one way, you read the ink blot another way. That's okay. That doesn't necessarily indicate that you're a great Christian or a lousy Christian, but it is a little bit of indicative of just where you might be in the process. What questions you're grappling through right now. Don't feel the pressure to come to a landing spot right this second. Let's just keep seeing what happens as we process through Matthew and get a better sense of what this king is about and what he has to say. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
