I really mean it. It's actually going to be a short one because we're just going to round out some of the ideas and really frankly very pregnant questions that are lingering from our little sub-discussion on forgiveness that comes at the end of the passage in Matthew chapter 6 that has the very famous Lord's Prayer in the middle of it where Jesus is talking about what it looks like to pray properly in light of the kingdom values but to pray properly according to Jesus in light of the kingdom values means that you give away the stuff God has given you and the first thing that God has given away in terms of us having a relationship with him is forgiveness. He's overlooked how vastly flawed and inferior we as imperfect beings are in comparison to him. So the whole relationship with God is predicated on his forgiveness, his grace, which means if that's what that relationship is predicated on Jesus seems to be in toning that all relationships flowing from the person who's received that forgiveness should also be marked by such forgiveness. And that's really sounds like a beautiful principle something would be cool to write like some kind of Christian song and we could sing it together and like really mean it and close our eyes and there could be smoke and maybe lights and stuff and we could repeat the chorus 72 times to show that we really really really mean it. But you know when it's super hard is when someone does something hyper crappy to us like really awful like deeply profoundly life changingly awful or when somebody does something that's just sort of awful but again and again and again and again and eventually you see it come and you're like you're just awful all the time. And if I trust you or I hang around you you're just going to do the same awful thing again and at some point I got to quit banging my head against his wall just I'm out in those situations how does forgiveness work can kingdom citizens actually be expected to be loving and forgiving toward people who are abjectly awful to them. I don't mean like said something mean one time in the hallway or gossiped a little bit or hurt your feelings. I mean awful stuff. What does it look like to forgive and if you've been hanging out with me over the last couple of conversations my guess is you're listening to this too and you're like that does sound great and I understand that I guess I have to do that but as I understand forgiveness to be I'm not sure I can do that. Let's break down that concept actually because I hear that a lot these days the concept of I just can't forgive or I'm not ready to forgive and from a counseling self actualization processing through anger and hostility perspective I get it I think it's totally valid language. I certainly feel that impulse and I would imagine that God who knows all things and made us and understands hurt and pain that he would understand that impulse but the text holds out absolutely no off ramp or exception to forgiveness nothing anywhere ever in the teachings of Jesus or anything that comes after that is there like you if you want to be forgiven by your father in heaven you have got to forgive other people unless what they did was like really offensive and you were really hurt or embarrassed like obviously you don't have to forgive then I mean that is super bad so there my command unto you my children would be to like work on it just like work toward forgiving that's not Jesus language at all and so to understand what he's saying in the text that we're trying to wrap our brains around we have to understand what he's not saying and I got to point out that he never gives some kind of exception if anything the implicit language of Jesus about forgiveness seems to be that forgiveness exists because of heinous things if something is little and trifling it's not so much a forgiveness that's just social grace forgiveness is not in place to overlook trifling little things we all do that regardless of our social system or moral system just to get by with people and have longevity to our relationships clearly if we're talking about forgiveness we're talking about the stuff that hurts we're talking about the worst stuff imaginable the stuff that I will take a pass on even describing as an example for the sake of the conversation you just fill in the worst stuff you can think of that's the kind of stuff that Jesus is talking about forgiving not working on but just doing let's just do a hypothetical here with me let's say somebody did something horrible to me like maybe when I was a kid like something to my body like something terrible that you wouldn't want them to do to anybody else ever and they have to be stopped and you just can't trust that person anymore because they're probably going to do stuff like that again I mean the pushback on the text might be well how can I forgive somebody like that they're just going to keep doing that don't I have some kind of obligation to justice or to some kind of closure with them or to prevent them from doing that to other people and I think the response here is that it is very common for us today to conflate two things that are very different forgiveness and reconciliation those are not the same thing but a lot of times when we think about forgiveness or we hear Jesus say words like this we think reconciliation but the text again when the book of Romans talks about you know us doing our best to be reconciled and at peace with everyone as much as it's up to you so the biblical text acknowledges that reconciliation is an ideal but not always an option we see that playing out in the life of Jesus I would say he was not reconciled to Judas after Judas's betrayal right Jesus didn't go chasing after him he didn't holler out at his disciples like make sure you go and track down Judas and make sure he's okay and work it out like that that looks like it was a pretty irreconcilable difference when Judas sold Jesus out to die for a few extra bucks so look reconciliation is what happens when we forgive and then we go through maybe some kind of process to kind of work things out with people and figure out like what went wrong here would it be possible for us to move forward is there a debt that that person owes to me to others to society that maybe really does need to be squared up as a teaching thing or a justice thing you have the right to release people from a debt they might owe you or to society but maybe some debts to society ought to be paid so that people don't further victimize maybe it's okay if as much as it's up to you a thing cannot be reconciled to put a lot of distance between yourself and somebody this dangerous troubling the awful destructive whatever I don't know but what I do know is that's different than forgiveness forgiveness appears to be according to the teachings of Jesus a state of mind a state of being that is always informed by what God did for people that is extend forgiveness in patience and so if you embrace that forgiveness in patience from God even though there might be some world consequences to sort through for stuff other people do to us maybe somebody owes us some kind of you know recompense I don't know Jesus said to be pretty forgiving and even generous toward our enemies but yeah I understand that's complicated and acknowledging that that teaching is something that the kingdom citizen would theoretically have to wrestle through as well still forgiveness is the absolute starting point it's the default position of the kingdom citizen according to Jesus in fact if it's not the default starting point you might not actually have ever been a kingdom citizen because the trademark of the kingdom citizen is the trademark of the king which is forgiveness an ability to look past and forgive the debts of those who owe a tremendous amount to him and likewise for us to forgive the debts of those who owe a tremendous amount to us first John is really interesting book that tackles a lot of these same questions about how what the kingdom citizen is received from God how that relates to what the kingdom citizen gives away to others and John was clearly writing a little bit after the fact in this letter that he put together and he's trying to help people sort out the difference between actual Christianity and kind of weird screwed up mutations of Christianity and he gives us threefold test that he develops in two cycles through the book of first John and the threefold test is basically morality does the person do the stuff morally that Jesus put forward and that list is not as long as a lot of people like to make it but you know there's stuff that these are kingdom things to do these are not kingdom things to do the next test is one of theology does the the claimant to being a kingdom citizen say the stuff that Jesus said or they're making up their own stuff with their own little twists and turns that has been a very popular thing to do over the last couple of thousand years and John's warning seems very prescient and very timely even today but then the third test in addition to the moral test and the theological test is the test of how you interact with your brother or your sister and the idea here is that if the supposed kingdom citizen received grace and love and mercy from God and doesn't give grace and love and mercy to other people that maybe that person didn't actually receive it maybe that person never actually signed up for the kingdom maybe there's goofing around or this is what their friends did or who knows why they're there but that's not real don't trust it push back on that in first John chapter four maybe the most concise turn of a phrase articulating that third test about the relationship between you know kingdom citizens and others says verse 19 we love because he first loved us as obviously Jesus if anyone says I love God yet hates his brother he's a liar for anyone who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen and he's given us this command whoever loves God must also love his brother that's pretty interesting at this point in the conversation because well for three reasons one you were like this one was going to be short why is it not short okay got me two because there are a bunch of you sitting here who are from some kind of Christian tradition or Christian background and you're like wow that that is pretty convicting because I've been burned in church and I've seen really not loving things and it's even maybe messed with my faith and been really frustrating maybe if you think about a little bit longer it might like occur to you that maybe at times you've even had some ownership and some of that stuff so one this is a little long two there are a bunch of Christians who are probably thinking that stuff three there are a bunch of people who I know were sitting in on this conversation with me you're not a Christian at all and you're like wow if Christians actually did the thing that that said that would be a lot more interesting to me but a lot of the press that I see about Christianity and a lot of the tweets and a lot of the face booking and a lot of the other things it seems like lots of people claim that they want to love God but the whole part where you go on to be like the consistent thing then is to love other people I don't know if I see that one quite as much and to the person who might hold that opinion he's an outsider to Christianity looking in I would say you're about half right I think about half of the time that you see that you're actually observing hypocrisy on my part and you are absolutely correct yep we yeah yep there's a reason that Christians actually need a God and aren't perfect because we just do stupid stuff and we and we don't get this right all the time but I would also submit that there's another half of the time where you know Christians it can be a pretty easy target and sometimes Christians are actually doing things that are good and redemptive and getting no credit and maybe even getting beat up or framed in ways that aren't entirely fair historically both of those realities can be true at the same time even if that makes us uncomfortable so here's a text that kind of cuts for everybody people in the faith people outside the faith it gives us all a ton to think about but what it does also is it kind of lands the plane on this concept that we've been processing for the last three days that if you got forgiveness you got to give away forgiveness that forgiveness additionally is not reconciliation reconciliation is the goal but a spiritual state of grace toward everyone is the trademark of the Christian it's the most basic tier one technique that on the the Christian skill tree chart everybody has that one ticked at the very beginning you got to have that one of the rest of the Christian skill tree is completely irrelevant and because forgiveness is that trademark basic skill one tier that identifies all Christians it is a constant state of being not an intellectual action that we do each time we're wrong kingdom citizens are just supposed to live in a state of constant forgiveness and grace is that weird is it antithetical to the rest of how things are well hey that's why we're looking at the sermon on the mount right because all of this is upside down kingdom stuff and frankly it's very challenging and very difficult and it all sounds nice when we started back on the Beatitudes it's like oh poor people and the poor in spirit and oh mercy is important we're like oh yeah that's great that's beautiful and then we actually start gaming it out we realize dang this is a little bit challenging but well there's a reason this is head staying power and i'm content to just let that challenge simmer on the question of forgiveness for the time being hey thanks everybody who has my back on the whole patreon thing that that means such a tremendous amount and a handful of additional people jumped in this week even with little stuff it just it it really helps i don't know i always feel weird talking about it i'm not trying to beg or anything but just you're awesome and thank you patreon.com slash the tmbh podcast is where people do that if you're not into that stuff awesome super still glad you're here okay we're landing the plane there and matt is the 10 minute bible hour podcast and we will do this again soon", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0,
