I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and whether you have been here since the very, very beginning or whether you have gone back and binged and caught up to where we are now or whether somebody put this in front of you. And this is your first episode ever. And you're like, I don't really know if I like this yet or anything. I'm a size of thing up, whoever you are, wherever you are in this daily conversation, or having about the Book of Matthew. It's really nice to have you here. Nice one to say thank you for hanging out with me because the world is busy and full of things to do. And yet you've made time to make this happen. So cool. Glad we get to be here. Have you ever traveled overseas where you're going to meet somebody like an expat or whatever that lives in this country that you're going to visit? If so, my guess would be that it gave you a bunch of tips when you were on your way there as a foreigner, as a traveler, as little insider stuff that they figured out. And my guess would be that one of those tips had to do with where to change currency. When I go to Nicaragua, I figured out really quickly why I'm figuring out I got told I don't change money at or around the airport that's not going to work out well. And my Nicaraguan friends were like, no, I'll tell you where to change your money. I got a guy. And he is on this particular intersection in Granada Nicaragua from like 10 in the morning until four in the afternoon. He takes a lunch break and there somewhere. But I'll introduce you to the guy. That's who you want to change money with. And they were right. There are certain people. It's a good deal to change money with. And there are people that you definitely want to avoid. But the only way to learn that on your own is by making expensive mistakes. And that's just one of the perils of being a traveler in a foreign land, I suppose. And so when we get to this passage in Matthew chapter 21, we've got a situation that's kind of like that. You got a whole bunch of people who are coming to Jerusalem all the time as outsiders. They're a part of what's called the Jewish diaspora. And because of a whole bunch of series of political and military events starting in the sixth century BC and running really all the way up to the time of Jesus, you've got this distribution of Jewish people who still believe in the God of Abraham and who still intend to offer sacrifices at the temple and are still studying what we would call the Old Testament scriptures, like all of that's still going on. But they live in Babylon. They live in Rome. They live in Ephesus, Corinth. They live in Alexandria. There's a huge population of practicing Jewish believers in Northern Egypt and Alexandria. And so these pilgrims from time to time and also non-Jewish Godfears would become an into Jerusalem. And it would be really easy because they're just culturally separated from the rhythm and the life beats of that town. It would be really easy for them to get taken advantage of by crafty people who could recognize a tourist when they saw them. In the process of researching this more, I've got a little better sense of what the niche in the historical economic situation was that some of these predatory types were exploiting. And it looks like the wiggle room they found for this exploit was in the varying metallic consistency or purity of the different currencies that circulated around the Mediterranean world. It looks like from my research that most Roman coinage would have been 80% pure. And then you got some other alloys and garbage metal mixed in there. I don't know if that was part of Roman metallurgy. And it wasn't that they were trying to make cheap coins. It's just that this seemed to be the most durable. Maybe the Romans designed their coins that way to make them a little bit more resistant to shaving a practice that we're going to talk about in just a minute. Or maybe they were just being cheap. I didn't want to draw on the treasury to the same extent to print coins and they knew they could make it stretch further if they watered it down a little bit. But other more local coinage in particular, the coinage of the Tyrions people from tired the Tyrion shekel was made at something more like a 94 or depending on who you ask. I haven't got it nailed down for sure. 96% purity. So what that means is that when somebody came to the temple to pay their temple tax, something that was initiated back in Exodus chapter 30, we looked at this several episodes ago when we were in Matthew. It sounds like I'm prepared and then I don't remember 18. No, it wouldn't be 18. It would be 17. Matthew 17. There it is concerning taxes. Yeah, right before we get into the discourse on the church life, that temple tax was the one that needed to be satisfied. And so Jesus told Peter to go catch a fish like a tilapia or something out of the Sea of Galilee and the right coin would be in there to pay both of their taxes. I think they called a tetra drakma coin. So for drakma to pay two people's to shekel tax. I think I got that right. What I'm trying to say is this, the difference in the Roman currency and the Tyrion currency was enough for the powers that be in Jerusalem, the people who ran the sacrificial system to be like, like you can't pay a temple tax with something that has only 80% purity. It has to be good. And the most pure thing is the Tyrion shekel, which is ironic because that's made by Gentiles, but whatever, I guess. And then further, you can't just bring any Tyrion shekel because coin shaving was a problem in the first century. Well, not just the first century. There's a problem all the way up into the 20th century. If you got a quarter in your pocket and you pull that thing out, a quarter is of significant enough value that eventually our mint decided that the thing to do is to put those little ridges on it. At least I think this is, I assume I should say this is why they do it. And if those ridges all around the rim of the quarter are intact, that means that would have the full silver value of a quarter. Now the quarters don't work that way anymore. Those from before the whatever 1960s are worth a crazy ton more money because they got the silver in them than the quarters after that. Quarters after that are worth, well, a quarter based on whatever inflation might happen to be at any given time. And the same way that you have no trouble comprehending the difference between how a cheapo quarter that's just based on whatever the government says it's worth at any given time is different than a quarter that's made of actual mineral value silver. Well, so you can understand the relationship between all these various coinages. And in the same way that you can pick up a quarter and see those little ridges on the edge and be like, ah, that quarter is intact. That it's it's complete. It's all there. Well, so you could look at a coin back in the day and you could see like, wait a dang minute here. This coin is lopsided on this one side. Now I've got a bunch of ancient coins. When you go and look at them, you'll see that almost none of them are round. They're all odd and kind of lopsided on the corners. Some of them are almost more like squares because of how much people would use little utensils to shave off some of that metal mineral value in ways that are almost imperceptible. Like here's still my coin. It would be like, if you cut off a little corner of a dollar bill and somehow that thing was worth a penny or five cents, well, all the dollar bills would be chopped up on the corners as people tried to eke out as much as they could while still being able to pass the bill off as valid. I'm sure at this point, some of you are like, why are we talking about coinage and economic theory? This weird. This isn't normally what you do. You haven't even read the passage yet. Next, so that's a very valid pushback. So here's the passage in question. Keep in mind all of this stuff we're talking about with coinage as I read it again. Matthew 21 12, Jesus has just made his way into Jerusalem. People are really excited about that. They don't really understand exactly who he is totally, but they're yelling Hosanna and they're happy he's there and it looks like he goes right to the temple and does this verse 12. Matthew 21, Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. It's written, he said to them, my house will be called a house of prayer, but you're making it a den of robbers. The reason that we're talking about all of this coinage and value stuff is because I think without any context, Jesus looks erratic and weird here. Why would you do this? Why would you have all that support and then go burn it by flipping over tables like a mad man? What would be the cultural understanding of what was going on? Well, one thing that I think would be the cultural understanding is that people would have been like, yeah, it's about time somebody did that. This has been a bastardization and a joke for ages. Look at what they do. They'll accept Roman coinage for literally anything else. Like it's good enough. I mean, all the businesses have to accept it anytime you want to buy bread to feed your family or fuel to take care of your home. You got to use that Roman coinage. It's good enough for the rest of us, but the elites over there at the temple, they get to make their own rules. And so they force everybody to convert their currency to some foreign Gentile currency from where from tire, what is that about that has higher value that would more benefit our family. But then on top of that, they are unbelievably nitpicky over there to make sure that God gets the very, very best. And so they look so closely at any shekel or any Roman coinage that you bring in to try and exchange to make sure it's valued properly. We hate to misvalue these coins. It's like the way you feel when you go to trade in your car and the person who assesses its value is super interested in the tiniest little nicks or dings, but not as interested in the ones on their vehicle. Don't worry. That's already been totally taken into account on the asking price. You feel that irritation. This would have been the same thing. Times a whole bunch more because religion is mixed in and authorities mixed in and it's not a voluntary transaction. And so in a great many ways, this is going to feel like a justice issue to a whole bunch of people when you and I start to understand that this wasn't just a friendly guy on the street corner in Granada, Nicaragua, giving you the best rate to serve you and to offer you a convenience so you can do business in his beloved community. These were predatory people exploiting travelers especially, but really exploiting everyone because of this lucky situation. Well, life gives you lemons. Let's make lemonade. Life gave us the lemons of Roman occupation, but we're going to make some lemonade out of this by scamming people using their loyalty to God to shave off both figuratively and literally just a little bit of their wealth and their income each and every time they come here to do what they're supposed to do in sacrificing to God. And frankly, I think there's something really appealing about somebody coming in and calling it what it is. And we certainly don't get the impression that the crowds were horrified and all of a sudden turned on Jesus and we're like, what are you doing? That's insane. No, right after that, like the blind and the lame come to him and more people yell, Hosanna and are excited about what's going on. It's not until later on that we start to see the tone and the tide turn in Jesus time in Jerusalem. Hopefully that was helpful and interesting. I had fun digging into that a little bit more.
