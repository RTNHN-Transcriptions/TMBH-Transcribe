We're in the home stretch of Galatians. Here we are following the Apostle Paul's final arguments in this book, the stuff he really wants us to take with us. Some of it is smoking gun. It's spelled out. You really can't miss it. Some of it is a little more subtle. It's illusions back to ideas that he built out really thoroughly earlier on in the book of Galatians, but we're going to try to catch them all. Got to catch them all. Or at least most. We're doing our best. Yesterday we talked about two points that Paul clearly is making at the end of this letter. One is that, hey, I Paul wrote this letter or dictated this letter and also I'm physically writing this part. Point number two, that should matter to you Galatians who are receiving this because there is such a thing as actual authority and the right version of this message. And I have demonstrated to you that you are getting that and that you can be confident in it, that you have the correct marching orders and that you should listen to this and base your actions and your trajectory on what I'm saying right now. There is such a thing as the actual church, actual true teachers, the actual message and you're hearing from it here throughout this letter. That's pretty bold. We live in an age of everybody's got an opinion and we have this shoot the middle fallacy thing that we do. I think it's just a way to try to make nice with people in a time where people fight a lot. But the middle fallacy is being like, well, the two craziest extremes that people think truth is right there at the 50% mark between them. It's of course nonsense when we think about that. It's not how it works, but these are chaotic times and it's strained. Our thinky brains and our sort through all of the noise brains so much that sometimes that lazy assumption is there. Sometimes we panic if somebody puts a flag in the ground and they're like, all right, there's a lot of opinions, but this thing is real. Paul is going to double down on that in the next couple of points that he's making here at the end and we took a bunch of time to look at in detail. So I won't unpack all of it again, but he goes on to say those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being prosecuted for the cross of Christ, not even those who were circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh. All right. So the next point that Paul is saying now that he's taken the pen and he's trying to make sure everybody you me the Galatians, everybody gets what was being said in this letter so we don't walk away confused. The next thing he wants us to get is the agitators are wrong. They're not a little wrong and I Paul am a little wrong on all of these points to let's not bicker about who said what everybody's a little right. Everybody's a little wrong. I think if we just find the middle, we can all move forward and we cannot have fighting anymore and we're just going to have a church moving forward in Galatia that is sort of a mingling of what they think and sort of a mingling of what me and Peter and Jesus think and we're it's just going to be, you know, the middle. Nope. Paul flies in the face of those modern sensibilities that you and I might have and instead says this is not a personality dispute. This cannot be hand waved. This is a pretty confrontational point that Paul is making, but they're bad. I'm good. The message they're telling you is wrong. The message I'm telling you is right. The message they're telling you isn't from God. The message I'm telling you is from God. Now it would be pretty lazy if all we got were these last seven verses were working on this week because then Paul would be making gigantic claims with nothing to back it up, but we have all of the book of Acts. We have all of the other letters, those that are in the Bible, those that are not in the Bible, and we have the rest of Galatians. So there's a ton of stuff Paul has earned the right to say it this directly here at the end as he sums it all up and reminds us of what the point is, but he is saying it directly. They're wrong. I'm right. Their stuff isn't from God. The stuff I'm telling you is from God. Listen to them. Do listen to me. It sounds kind of freaky, but I say again, Paul has earned it. And this is refreshing to me in a way, even though it does kind of, you know, clang against modern sensibilities, it's refreshing because think of how many times you've been in a personality dispute where everyone sees things differently and many words get expended on trying to smooth it over and to swage the thing so that we can just somehow move forward. Solve it. No, usually that isn't the agenda anymore. It's smooth it over. And so you burn all these words. Everybody says all this stuff. Maybe you get everybody in a room and everybody gushes out all of the things that they feel or whatever. And then in the end, it's sort of like, Hey guys, let's just hug it out and let's move forward. Well, the truth is when we do that one, I mean, it waters down. Moving forward is going to be like there's a lot of naivete when we walk out of a room after having done that and not addressed anything to imagine that these problems are now somehow solved because people are on speaking terms. It's harder than that sometimes to solve problems. Sometimes easier. But the other thing that happens coming out of those conversations is sometimes you walk away from it and a day or two later, you're thinking about it and you realize I have no idea what the actual take home of those lengthy conversations, those lengthy interpersonal resolution interventions that we did in those meetings for the last week. I mean, what, what do we actually land on? What was the point? And if you've ever been in that situation, you might talk to people who were in the meeting with you and realize we all heard totally different things. We all landed on totally different conclusions and somehow they were all simultaneously affirmed. Wait a minute. Was this bad thing that happened in the group condemned? Did we all agree that's bad and we're not going to ever do that again? Or did we not actually say that? Well, let there be no such ambiguity at the end of Galatians. Lest a lot of words and complex theology and lest three or four movements of thought that Paul takes us through in this letter, lest that cloud our minds and leave us feeling foggy, Paul grabs the pen and is like, let's be crystal clear. Their teaching is condemned. They are condemned by Paul, the apostles, and therefore with the authority of Jesus, their teaching is condemned. Don't do it. Don't embrace it. They are wrong and bad. Well, sister, brother, you got to give Paul this. No ambiguity, real clarity there. From an institutional perspective, it's going to make people uncomfortable. But you know exactly what the conclusion is. It would be impossible to walk away from this letter with any kind of fog about how Paul is saying the things are. And maybe if we didn't have this little bit at the end where Paul grabs the pen, we could be like, okay, there's a bunch of stuff about life by the spirit and treating each other well in church and the fruit of the spirit. And before that, there was some kind of fight about something like Sarah and Hagar factored in there somewhere and be like Abraham. I think we're supposed to be maybe like Abraham. I don't know. It was a lot of letter ago that we covered all of that stuff. And way back at the beginning, there was something about him being disappointed with us and like some people who maybe they were wrong. I don't remember exactly. Well, no, dang it. You are going to remember exactly because Paul's like, hey, and if I offended you by saying they were wrong or maybe you're hoping I didn't mean it, let me just be clear. I totally meant it. They are wrong and bad. So what do we have so far from Paul in terms of concluding remarks? One, I Paul wrote this. Now I'm writing it in my own hand. Two, it matters that I Paul am writing it because I'm a part of team authority team Jesus team actual Christianity. Three, with that authority, I am telling you the people who came into your midst and did this stuff and threw you into confusion are wrong and bad. Do not integrate 5% of what they're doing or thinking is some sort of compromise. To be denounced, renounced. There isn't life in that. That is a step backwards. Don't listen or incorporate it at all. Bold. But in the midst of making sure that we all get exactly where he stands and what the marching orders are moving forward, he's also going to dip back into some more of the theology here in the next couple of verses with just a couple of quick references. And that's what we're going to talk about tomorrow as we continue to work through Paul's concluding remarks and what the Galatians were supposed to take from this and be crystal clear on and what we're supposed to take from this and be crystal clear on. I'm still shooting for end of this week to wrap up Galatians, but now I have an idea about something else that I want to do to cover some things that happened after Galatians. Maybe how it worked out for everybody here. Yeah, we're going to go for a while and then it's going to be done and then we're going to start by Lehman and it's going to be great. I guess we'll just see what happens together. Okay, time for me to shut up. A mat is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
