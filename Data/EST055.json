This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and I really like joking around, but I don't know how much of that I'm going to do on the front end of this conversation because we're getting into some really icky territory in the Book of Esther. It was a trade-off being proposed that is very difficult to properly add up or conceptualize with modern thinking. And so we need to try to add this thing up morally, ethically, and in terms of the opportunity and the cost at hand through the lenses of the original audience, or this book isn't going to make a ton of sense. We started on that project yesterday by talking about in Esther chapter 2 how the advisors to King Xerxes saw that he was sad and mopey and down after having a big drunken bash a few years back and firing his wife for not doing what he said in front of everybody, especially in what he said to do was pretty exploitative and weird. He's also down because he just lost a big war in front of the whole world to these teeny, little nobody Greeks clear out west. And then he's also embarrassed and alone because at least according to Herodotus he came back and immediately made horrible decisions relationally with his brother's wife and his brother's daughter and his own son's wife, some of those people overlap, but that's how convoluted and messy it was. And now we get a reflective Xerxes who's hanging out alone and we get these parameters for a contest to replace his wife and make him less lonely. So from the beginning from a modern perspective, I said we were going to try to just think about it from their perspective, but I guess we're going to have to bounce back and forth. From a modern perspective, the idea here is let's go out and just get some poor young doe-eyed girl who would like to be the queen because that's every little girl's dream. And we're going to pick the very, very best one so that the king can be happy. We're going to use this girl, whoever the lucky winner is to make the king feel better and see if we can get him to govern more effectively because his mind isn't properly on things the right way. But from an ancient point of view, well, no, actually the equation is nearly identical. I think everybody knew exactly what was going on here. I think the bigger question is just how would people have perceived the opportunity to go and enter into a contest like this that again, by modern terms, is obviously exploitative. And by ancient terms is probably exploitative. But you also got to remember what we talked about yesterday and the day before that the greatest commodity, literally the most valuable thing that anybody on the planet could own. Anybody other than the king himself could own at this point was unfettered access to the king because his moods, his whims, his decisions would inform the fate of nations and people groups and finances and let alone family fortunes or an individual fortune. That's why people like Memicon from chapter one were so keen to take angles to get as much of that pool, that pie of influence as they could for themselves. I have to think that a whole bunch of people in the ancient world would be like, look, this is distasteful. I mean, obviously that's a tough deal for the ladies, but I mean, they're going to marry somebody. They're going to get married off to some other family. Either way, these marriages are probably all going to be arranged one way or another. And probably most of these men aren't going to be, at least in a modern term, the most easygoing husbands. So maybe the thinking just went, well, young girls get married off and they generally get married off to some kind of difficult situation for them. That's a little bit there a lot in life. I mean, but what if you could be married off in a difficult situation to the king and have the most of the most desirable commodity in the kingdom, which is access to the king? Who knows? To have that kind of access might give a young girl who has just the right charms, the ability to tame his soul. And maybe she could be happy. And on top of being happy, maybe she could change the fortunes of her entire family. Or as we're going to see as we work forward in the book of Esther, change the fortunes of her entire people group. Do you see what I'm getting at here though, in a modern sense, there are plenty of opportunities for everybody. And look, I know the people debate in their different political positions on whether all the opportunities are fully equitable yet or not. I suppose that's a conversation for some other time on some other podcast. But compared to back then, good heavens, things are in really good shape now in terms of opportunities for everybody, no matter what they look like or what they believe in or how they live their life. I mean, just massive opportunity at this point in history. We got a different economic system. We got a different social system. The world is totally different place, but there weren't opportunities like that in fifth century Persia. There weren't opportunities around every corner for a young lady with some gumption and character and willing to put in the hard work and hustle. That wasn't the way things were built. If somebody was a young woman and they wanted opportunity that went beyond marriage, they were probably going to have to pursue that through the oldest profession. Or maybe if they were lucky and I'm using euphemism, serum searching, they could end up being a manager of people who work in the oldest profession. Now, I have read a ton of stuff about Persia. I've listened to tons of lectures about Persia. I spent a ton of time while we were still back working on Matthew on the side. I was refreshing stuff. I'd learned about Persia and school and then trying to level up my game and really know the material and understand not just the high points and the big characters like we've talked about. I put a lot of effort into understanding the rhythms of life in Persia because Esther starts with the big grand narrative stuff. But I know it takes us down into the interpersonal stuff, the gender role stuff, the economic stuff, the social role stuff. I listened to what a lot of people had to say about that. I can tell you this. There are a lot of very intelligent professors and talented people who bent over backwards to try to find a reference here or there to women having opportunity in the age of Persia. And it's fascinating to me that they all ended up with the same anecdote here or there. I got a letter here that was written as kind of a receipt for some grain and we think this is a woman's name who might have signed for it. It was stuff like that. So you might go and Google things and be like, really, did women have no opportunities in Persia and be like, but what about that? No, that might have been signed or you might come up with a couple of examples or a YouTube video, but listen closely to it. Look closely at it. It's a stretch. It's modern hopes of making Persia look a little bit better, being inflicted upon it. The reality is this was a dude's world and overwhelmingly in Persia. If a woman was to have power, it was by being married to a successful, powerful man and then navigating behind the scenes to make things happen. I'm not saying that's the way life ought to be. I don't think that is the way life ought to be. I'm saying we need to deal in the reality of what was going on here. And part of the reason we need to deal in that reality is because we want to understand how the original audience would have thought about the young girls being thrust into this role. And my guess, my friends, is that the original audience would have viewed this as the opportunity of a lifetime. My guess is that they would have understood this is going to be tough and the king's probably going to be a very tough man to be married to. And you're going to have to endure the reality that the king is going to have limitless women on the side. And the king probably won't even cover it up or hide it. The king will add newer and younger women to his harem, maybe newer and younger wives constantly. And that's just what you're signing up for. But young ladies, this will still be worth it. This is the highest status, the highest state, the highest influence, the highest power, the highest opportunity to bless your family that you could ever hope to aspire to. Everybody knows that it's going to be pretty abusive by modern standards when you actually get into the mix of it. But nonetheless, I think women and men, empire-wide, would have been enraptured at the idea of an open invite, an open contest to see who would get to occupy this role next. My friends, this is not a fairy tale. And sometimes I feel like the handling of Esther is rather fairy tale-like. But the grit of this story, which is artfully made evident enough for most of the audience to catch it, yet subtle enough for some of the audience to miss it, that grit is real. And as it applies to this particular contest that we were talking about yesterday and today, it is reflective of an event that would have made the young girls being rounded up, both terrified, but also oddly excited. And also, I think every one of these girls would have gone with the blessing of their family who would have given them the biggest, most sincere, pump-up talk they had ever received as they climbed onto that litter or into that carriage or onto that horse or however they made their way back to Persia with the royal retinue that would have escorted them. I promise you, they were riding away from parents and family members who had tears in their eyes but riding away with the great hope of that entire family, that whole village, that whole region with them. Which leads us to the final question here. And it's a question that I think we're rightly very concerned about when it comes to things like this with our modern sensibilities and that is, was this voluntary or not for most of these girls? And I think it's a question that sort of doesn't work in this era. I think the forces and pressures in play made it such that voluntary or not voluntary to go and be a part of this competition really wasn't a thing. The alternatives were next to nothing if selected for something like this. So in summary, I think the original audience would have been enchanted by the idea of having this contest. I think the king would have been intrigued by the idea of having this contest. I think the advisors needed to have this contest and they needed to make this manipulatable, childish, petulant, depressed king feel like he was getting the very best girl. So he wouldn't be second-guessing himself anymore. I think the young ladies in this thing saw the opportunity but also would have been terrified and knew that they were signing up for a difficult life but maybe a more desirable difficult life than the other difficult lives that they were going to get signed up for if they weren't a part of this contest and if they didn't get picked. This is a tough situation and I don't think we do ourselves any favors. I don't think we do the text any favors by trying to put lipstick on it yet now that we're here and now that we're about to be introduced to the heroine of the story, it seems like all we can do is root for her. We're expected to understand that the best outcome would be her winning and we're going to meet this young lady we're rooting for next time around. A mat is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
