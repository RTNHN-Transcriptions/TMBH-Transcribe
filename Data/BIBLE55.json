    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Second Timothy. Second Timothy is the last letter we're aware of that Paul ever wrote, and it reads like it. It's heavy, it's weighty, it's human, it's emotional, there's a passing of the baton, and also there's a piece to it. Paul feels good about what he used his life on. He still doesn't think, even as he's sitting in this freezing cold Roman prison, he still doesn't think that there's anything better he could have used his time on, and he's exhorting the recipient of the letter, young Timothy, his protege, to see it the same way and to follow suit. The guy who taught me the Old Testament and first introduced me deeply to the idea that the Bible was rooted in history and said in history, real people, real places, real times. The first time that history and academics really overlapped with the Bible for me was in this guy's classes in my undergraduate education. His name was Samir Masu, he was a Lebanese dude, he was phenomenal in terms of his abilities, in terms of his talent for communication, and in terms of his personal conduct, how he treated people. I deeply, profoundly respected this guy, and just a couple years back, I called him with some questions about the Bible for things you and I talk about here, and I could sense in his voice that he was not doing well. I found out later that he was very, very sick when we had spoken. We talked, he offered me some really helpful feedback that made its way again into the conversation you and I had, and then as we're getting ready to jump off the phone, he totally switched gears, completely different tone. I don't know if it was off the cuff or if he thought about it in advance or if maybe he had done this with some other people in his life, but he gave me this incredibly meaningful blessing and commissioning. I didn't see it coming. Fortunately, I had the good sense to just keep my mouth shut and listen very closely to try to receive it. And then we say goodbye, and that was the last time I ever talked to him. He passed away shortly thereafter. It feels like what we're getting in 2 Timothy is that same kind of thing. It's a closing blessing, it's a closing exhortation, it's a taking of the baton, and a handing off of that to say, now you take it and you run with it with the fullness of my blessing. And so when we get to the end of this letter, I'm just going to tell you in advance, I feel very strongly that if you're compelled by what you see in the Bible, by what you see in the New Testament, that maybe you just kind of owe it to Paul to read this whole thing from beginning to end. And maybe with your antenna out for what part of this blessing is maybe transferable to you, what part of this might have been written with future audiences, with you in mind to receive what's in it as well. I like this one, and I got a soft spot for it. The structure of it is really simple. Point number one is he's reflecting on his life, and he's saying this is the way I want to deliver it. I wouldn't do it any other way. Big time paraphrase his mind there, but it's faithful to what he's communicating. And he's thankful to God for helping him to see it through. He's thankful to God for his faithfulness, and he's exhorting Timothy not to be ashamed of Jesus and also not to be ashamed of his spiritual father, Paul. Apparently a lot of people had been like, well, Paul, if you're right, how come God keeps letting you get in prison? I'm not going to hang around with that and take the social punishment that comes from associating with you. This is a human phenomenon we still see today when people get in trouble on the Internet, and everybody goes underground real quick and gets real, real quiet because they don't want the bad vibes of however one individual ran afoul of everyone on the Internet to rub off on them. The same thing was happening back then. Paul was lonely. He says at the end of his letter that only Luke has remained with them, and he wants Timothy to get ahead of the weather because it's wintertime and get there to see him. But in all of that, in the opening of this letter, Paul is saying Christ is faithful. Timothy remained faithful to Christ. Make that the centerpiece of your life moving forward. In the second part of the book, Paul deals with a few practical things still dealing with ongoing problems and Ephesus. First Timothy was maybe written three, four, maybe as many as five years earlier. And despite Timothy's efforts, it looks like there were still problems, particularly there were still problems with people denying the existence of resurrection, denying the existence of this future hope of life in Christ, or maybe just suggesting that the resurrection already happened, and it's already over with. Either way, the result is the same. It's making for a weird, ineffective faith and a bad read on the Scriptures or even a disregard for the Scriptures. As Paul is like, hey, Timothy, you've got to point people back to that stuff. All Scripture is God breathed. It's wildly useful for a whole stack of things. And all of that stuff that Scripture does is meant to make the man of God, the woman of God, thoroughly equipped for every good work, and Ephesus could use a dose of that. And then in the final chapter, Paul says, look, people are not going to like the things that you have to say. You being a faithful representative of Jesus is going to be provocative and an irritant. It's okay. Be steadfast. Stay in it. Nothing matters more. And then he gets into those really personal greetings that I've talked about a bit throughout our conversation here, including things as specific as like, hey, Timothy, it's very cold in this prison and we're headed into Roman winter. Would you bring my coat? And also I have a stack of scrolls that I left in Troas. Would you grab those as well? And again, please hurry. The weather's changing. I don't want you to get delayed by weather because I might not ever get to see you again. If Paul has a feeling this is it. And indeed, this was it. He was executed in Rome shortly after writing this letter. When you visualize the book of 2 Timothy, picture a cold prison. When you think about the theme, reflect on the dangerous, meaningful life in service of Christ that Paul had lived and the invitation that he gives to Timothy, and I think by proxy us to follow suit. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, please make time to read the whole thing. I think Paul has earned the dignity of being thoroughly heard out in these final thoughts, and I think you'll find it to be very meaningful as well. All right, there we go. That's 2 Timothy Achievement Unlocked. Next time around, we're on to the Book of Titus. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again soon.
