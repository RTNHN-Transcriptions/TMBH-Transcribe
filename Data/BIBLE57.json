    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it is one big cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Philemon. The Book of Philemon is a letter written by the apostle Paul to a Christian leader in the Church of Colossae named Philemon. And if you recall back to when we did our conversation about the Book of Colossians, the Paul didn't really know anybody in that church or almost nobody in that church. He didn't found the church, he hadn't been there yet, and he wrote that letter to the Colossians from one of his many prisons days and was hoping to get to go and visit them sometime later when he got out. He was aware of some of the problems and the challenges in that church and he was particularly interested in having them reimagine how they do their households there in light of the truth of the new family of faith and the equalizing effect that the work of Christ has in making this new family of faith where everybody, regardless of your gender, your race, or your ethnicity, or even your social status, even slave or free according to Paul in Colossians 3 verse 11, reimagine all of that because you're all equal in Christ as members of this new family, as sons, daughters, children, heirs, agents of the king because of the glorious work of Christ. It's pretty awesome and it's wildly forward thinking. It's also the kind of thing that just begs for a test case to figure out if anybody actually means it. Because if you take that to its logical conclusions, it would require Christians to act in some ways that are very weird and very countercultural. And that is exactly what we get in the scenario surrounding this book of Philemon and the content of the letter there in. Philemon, the recipient of this letter, is a wealthy leader in the church at Colossae and Paul seems to hold him in high regard. My guess would be that Philemon became a Christian because of that Ephesus effect we've talked about before. Remember Paul said that what happened in Ephesus among the Christians had a ripple effect. It affected the whole greater Ephesus region and it looks like Colossae is a byproduct of that being founded by Apaphris, who we talked about before, and Philemon. Well, everybody in the Roman world had servants and slaves in their household. Now this is not the ethnic slavery of the British colonial world and the American south. This is a social slavery and it's a different flavor, but it is still not good and it's not the status one would want to find themselves in at the same time. It was very baked into how society and the economy worked all throughout the Roman world. So it would not be weird on its surface. Pretty much nobody would look at anyone Christian or otherwise having slaves in their household and be like, what are you doing? That is a moral abomination. But weirdly, Paul taking the conclusions of the message of Christ out to their logical ends does raise an eyebrow at it. And it looks like the scenario that unfolded in Colossae is that Philemon had a slave named Onesimus and somehow Onesimus wrongs him and then runs away. That's a pretty big deal and that's very punishable by Roman law. I don't know how Onesimus ends up visiting Paul in prison, but he does. And through the influence of Paul, he becomes a Christian. Well, now we got ourselves a bona fide conundrum because Philemon is a Christian and Onesimus is a Christian and Paul's been going around saying that, hey, if you really think about what Jesus is saying here, like we're all sons and daughters of the king and that transcends and trumps the social order of things. Well, is Paul going to stick with that or is Paul going to back down because now it's very inconvenient and he might lose a church by irritating one of the prominent leaders of this church. If Paul were to mishandle the situation and maybe advocate for Onesimus and not give Philemon, the justice that he is owed for the bad behavior of his slave under Roman law, what is Paul to do? And what's going to happen right now between you and I is a little bit different than anything we've done before. I've actually invited a guest who is an expert on the subject to tell you about what Paul decided to do with the situation and that is the Apostle Paul because it's a really short letter and I can just read you the whole thing and I'm straight up going to do that, but pay extra close attention. I know sometimes with lots of Bible words in a row, it can be easy to let that start to wash over you. But think about the setup that we just went through here. Think back to what we know about the Colossian church. Think about what Paul has been saying about the rules for households and the way he's been undermining slavery as an institution in favor of this better human relationship born out of Christ and see if you can catch all of the subtle things that he is doing here. It goes like this, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy, our brother to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker to Afia, our sister to archapace, our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers because I hear about your faith and the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you'll have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ. Your love has given me great joy and encouragement because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints. Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you want to do, yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus, I appeal to you for my son, Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he's become useful both to you and to me. I'm sending him, who is my very heart, back to you. I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I'm in chains for the gospel, but I didn't want to do anything without your consent so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced. Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good. No longer is a slave, but better than a slave as a dear brother. He's very dear to me, but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord. So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he's done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back, not to mention that you owe me your very self. I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you and the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience. I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. And one more thing, prepare a guest room for me because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. A path for us, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus sends you greetings. And so to Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with your spirit. Seems like a real friendly little letter, right? Like, it's good to talk to your prayer room and everything. I'm sending him back. You know, you know what I'll probably work out, but it's not. It's a huge ask because Paul is not only asking Philemon to forgo the justice he has owed, but further he's asking Philemon to free this slave and treat him as a brother. Everybody in town would know what he did. Everybody would know that he didn't exact this justice. It might look like he's gone soft. Plus, apparently, Onesimus was really talented and good at things. And that would be a loss for Philemon's household. What a gigantic request on the part of Paul. But clearly, Paul thinks Philemon is good for it and that he's going to do it. It's a reversal that's reminiscent of the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, right? Where the kid takes all his dad's money and goes, he blows it on stupid stuff. And then he's like, ah, I'm broken. I'm eating pig slop. I'm going to go back to my dad. And I'm going to be like, Dad, I'm sorry. I sinned against you in this heaven. Just take me back as one of your servants. Remember, he has that whole speech rehearse, but the dad sees him from a long ways off. And he goes running out to the offender, his son. And he doesn't even let him get through the whole speech and he embraces him. And not only forgives the wrong that he did, but restores him to that role of cherished family member of son. Once again, that's the request that Paul is putting in front of Philemon. And if Philemon does it, it's going to change him forever. It's going to change Onesimus forever. It's going to change that church forever. It's going to change Colossae forever. But look at the little note there toward the end to where Paul doesn't write off the offense. There's still a debt that is owed, but Paul in imitating Jesus is like, charge it to me. I'll take that punishment. I had nothing to do with what went wrong. But if a debt is owed, I will pay the debt so that this thing can be made right. This new family can be formed. This is a beautiful real world manifestation of what this new paradigm that we were begging for coming out of the Old Testament looks like in action. Now, my friends, this is no throwaway letter. This is a huge moment in the history of the church, a huge moment in the unfolding of the New Testament. And further, this sets a trajectory for all of the justice that has been done and that has happened in the name of Christ throughout the centuries. And that continues to happen today in the name of Christ. This is a natural, necessary extension of all of the stuff we've been seeing about who Jesus is and his words and his works and the cross and the resurrection. And all of the stuff that Paul has taught and lived out since, along with the other apostles, it points toward this kind of selflessness, this sort of forgiveness and restoration. And I think this is absolutely beautiful. And I hope you go and read this letter for yourself. When you visualize the book of Philemon, picture a runaway slave. When you think about the theme, reflect on the way the new paradigm, the new covenant in Christ rewrites everything about our relationships. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, don't worry about it. I just read it to you. You got that one in your hip pocket now. Philemon, level up. Next time around, one of the most theologically dense books in the whole New Testament. It's the very rich book of Hebrews. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
