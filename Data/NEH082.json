And if that is the case, it's really nice to have you here. Thank you for hanging out. It might feel a little overwhelming on the front end because you're just jumping in right to the middle of a conversation that we're having working our way through the book of the Bible. In this case, it's Nehemiah, but you don't need to feel overwhelmed because there's going to be something in every episode that's going to make sense and get this thing to click. We just pick a book of the Bible. We work through it a little bit each day. And today we're in Nehemiah chapter six at the end of a sequence where Nehemiah, the cut bearer to the king of Persia, has heard that Jerusalem, the walls, they're all in ruins. People want to kill the returning Jewish exiles who are moving back to long abandoned Jerusalem with the blessing of the king to rebuild the temple and reestablish their way of life and reestablish their religious rhythms. But in the process of doing this, it's expensive. It's hard to do. And it's happening over the course of generations and people lose heart and get distracted. And as a result, the walls aren't done. And now people are starting to get antsy in that region about the returning Jewish exiles rebuilding things and things are starting to heat up. And the Jewish people there under a lot of pressure here in the mid 400s BC in the book of Nehemiah. And so Nehemiah makes their problem, his problem. And he asks the king for permission to go back and figure out how to cut through all the red tape and all the bureaucracy and simply solve the problem. Right now there aren't walls and we're going to need walls. That's what he's trying to do. The king gives him permission. He goes back to Jerusalem, which is a very long journey back in those days from clear out east where the palace was, scouts it out and discovers this is going to be challenging, but it can be done. He invites everybody to get cracking on it and they do and they make a ton of progress, but not everybody likes it. The three dudes, Sanbalat, Tobiah and Geshim, they are not Jews and they do not want Jerusalem to get its walls built up. They think that's a threat to their interests in the region. And so they cook up all kinds of clever plans to oppose Nehemiah's effort to do this rapid fire rebuild of these walls. Plans that range from trying to undermine him with gossip and narrative writing all the way up to accusing him of treason and trying to get him killed as a traitor all the way up even further to simply inviting him out into the desert at night to murder him under the false pretenses of just wanting to have a little chit chat. They go even further and pay off a couple of low ranking Jewish prophets to do some fake prophecies about how Nehemiah is bad to try to undercut Nehemiah's progress and stop this wall from getting built. But these bad guys who were opposing the rebuilding of the wall, they're dealing with the force of nature in Nehemiah. This guy is a phenomenal leader, utterly focused so he can't be distracted. He can't be tricked. And after clearing all of these hurdles and enduring all of these tests from his enemies, finally at the end of Nehemiah chapter six is done. The walls are built and he announces in Nehemiah 6 15. So the wall was completed on the 25th day of Elul. That's the name of a month in 52 days, 52 days is all it took for Nehemiah to cut through the red tape, blast past all of the opposition, the hurdles, the naysayers, the sick days, the excuses, everything and simply take things from a state where there aren't walls to a state where there are walls, mission accomplished. Great job, Nehemiah. But what I want to talk about in this next little part of Nehemiah that we're coming up on here is this tag, this little bit at the end of Nehemiah chapter six where it seems like we should be done. It really seems like the chapter should wrap up. The walls are completed. Great. We're done with the wall saga. What happens next? But instead Nehemiah gives us on his, let me count it up 16, 17, 18, 19, he gives us four verses demonstrating where he just wants to make a note of a few more shenanigans that had gone on. He wants to make a note of some big picture abuses and bad behavior that had happened and he wants to name some names. Now is that nice or is that mean? Because forgiveness is important. And on the one hand it feels like, you know what? We fought hard and you tried to stop us. You played your hand. Ultimately, we tried to rebuild the wall and in the end we won and you lost because now the wall's up. But the time for fighting is over. We all played our roles. Now the wall is done. Let's just forgive and forget and not bicker about who killed who and just move forward. But Nehemiah is not really in a mood to adopt that posture. Rather, he's in a mood to lean into a key theme of this book of Nehemiah that a whole lot of it at least he is writing. And that key theme is remembrance. Remember the people who got it right. Remember the people who got it wrong. Remember the people who did overt great evil. Remember the people who did subtle, almost unnoticeable good seeking no credit. And ultimately a key theme in the book that Nehemiah keeps pounding is, oh God, remember me for trying to get this stuff right. And remember my enemies for what they did. And ultimately Nehemiah's tone is, you know, God, you will ultimately get to be the judge of these bad guys and what they did. And I think it is easy when you're not vested in a thing to be like, yeah, we fought long enough. You know what, let's just let by guns be by guns. Let's just have a general absolution here, a general amnesty. That's not really worry about how people behaved during a time of great pressure and what they did to their neighbors and the awful things they said or even voted for. Let's just not worry about that. Let's just move forward. But then other people when they were more in the thick of these things like Nehemiah in this situation, there may be a little more in a place where like, all right, in a general sense, sure, I forgive you, but I'm not forgetting what happened here. I learned who you were and I don't see anything to indicate that that has changed. Let the records show that the people who were wrong on this issue of rebuilding the wall, the people who behaved murderously and deceptively and tried to weaponize the government against what was good and the people who were doing right. Let those of us who saw make a mental note that that's who they are and that's what they did. These people have not asked for forgiveness. They haven't acknowledged what they got wrong. This is still who they are. And I think that's the spirit in which Nehemiah is tagging on this little bit here at the end. And all of this reminds me of a country song that I encountered with the kids. It's one that I remember from childhood. Yeah, I wasn't really a country guy growing up. I just had a little phase to please one high school girlfriend and some of it stuck with me. I didn't get it. I didn't appreciate it. But we do music appreciation with the kids all the time. We listen to stuff from all different eras and I use it to teach them about history and fads and why a certain type of music would resonate with people at a certain time, but not at another time. We're on a ragtime Scott Joplin kick right now. We did a music appreciation lesson earlier today on the propaganda music of World War one. We really get into this. But a while back it was early nineties country time and this song comes up that is called Little Rock by Colin Ray. Do you remember this one? It's a sweet song. I didn't remember much about it from childhood, but the song hit me really hard when it came on. And I heard this thing as an adult and as a dad, the songs about a guy who's ruined his life. He led his wife down and it sounds like he did something really bad. He really blew it. And now they live apart and he's in Little Rock selling VCRs at the local Walmart and he's not drinking anymore. And he's given her this update and that's the tone of the song. It's a deeply repentant self reflective song, but it's written so honestly that you can tell he still doesn't have everything straightened out. I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock solid as a stone, baby, wait, NC to ring a bell at all. If not, I just made a fool of myself for no reason. And he sings it. It sounds really, really good. Well, there's this one line that I do remember from when I heard this as a kid about the confrontation that he had with his father in law. It goes like this. I don't know why I held it all inside. You must have thought I never even tried. You know your daddy told me when I left, Jesus would forgive, but a daddy don't forget. I thought that was a catchy rhyme when I heard it as a kid, but I heard that as a dad of daughters now and as an adult, old enough to have needed forgiveness. And the song hit a lot harder. It's really pretty powerful, pretty well written, pretty well done, deeply, deeply honest and good. If you never heard it before, go check the thing out. I remember when I heard that as a kid, I told my dad about that lyric. I was like, yeah, this isn't very Christian. This isn't how it is. And I remember dad was like, no, forgiveness is important. And we forgive everybody automatically as Christians. You can't withhold forgiveness from people at all and want forgiveness from God. And I was like, oh, I mean, it's one of the first times I ever heard that. I think that's absolutely true. And he's like, but what the dad in that song seems to be saying is that he learned something about his son in law. And while he might forgive what he learned sticks, maybe it's a little bit harsh the way it's all framed together. But I feel like that's kind of what we're getting here in Nehemiah. Yeah, it's right and righteous and good and needed to forgive. I mean, if you don't forgive people, then all of a sudden they live rent free in your brain. That eats your lunch. It wrecks your soul. It's soul toxin. Not forgiveness is dark magic that you feel like you control and wield, but it actually controls you. Doesn't do you any good not to forgive. And the Bible says you've got to forgive. So if you're Christian, you know, you just, you got to do it even selfishly. It's good for you to forgive. But the remembrance thing, that theme that we get here in Nehemiah, that's a real deal. But at least the song gives the impression that Colin Ray is sad about what he did. And that repentance, I would hope would maybe soften that father in law's heart over time. The people in Nehemiah are not sad. So Nehemiah metaphorically tagging on this little bit that I still haven't read you. I need to read it to you before we're done here. At the end, that we'll break down in depth tomorrow is, I mean, it's metaphorically him kind of saying like, yep, this worked out. God is good. God is good. Praise God for all of it. But I learned who these people were. And we should remember who these people were because they have not squared accounts. They are still who they were when they did these evil, violent, bloodthirsty, opposed to God, opposed to what is right things. And they are still among us happy to do these things again. And I think that's why we get the remembrance tag. Nehemiah 615. So the wall was completed on the 25th day of Elle in 52 days. When all our enemies heard about this and all the surrounding nations saw it, our enemies lost their self-confidence because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God. Also in those days, the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah. That's the enemy. Remember, the replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. This is all curious. Verse 18, for many in Judah were under oath to him to Tobiah. He was the son-in-law to Shekania, son of Eira, and his son, Jehonn'an. Oh my goodness. Jehohn'an. That stuff had married the daughter of Mesulam, son of Barakiah. Also, this is all a big tangled up mess. We'll try to untangle it, manana. Moreover they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me. And that's it. It's kind of the wrap up. So the tag is less than celebratory and pretty emphatic about the importance of remembering these people and that they are still unrepentantly at large and still likely to work toward these destructive ends with these vile, dishonest, even deeply violent tactics. Fascinating stuff. We'll get into more of it tomorrow. If this was your first time hanging out here, again, welcome. If this wasn't your first time hanging out here, thank you for coming back to the thing. Either way, I'm Matt. This is the 10-minute Bible Hour podcast.
