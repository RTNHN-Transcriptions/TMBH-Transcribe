This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and I want to say welcome back to everybody's been doing this for a really long time. This is continue to marvel at the fact that we have been inching our way through the book of Matthew together since like we were babies. And it's really, really fun that this is something that we've shared together that we're learning about together. Thanks for making it a part of your day. Also, I know that some of you are here for the very first time ever. And you've never been a part of this podcast before and you haven't been here since you were a tiny little baby. And you're like, this is a little bit intimidating because I'm walking into a podcast that's kind of established. They probably have their own little inside baseball language and like little jokes and stuff that they tell. And I don't know if I'll know when to laugh or what to do nonsense. You're welcome. You can just jump right in here and be a part of it immediately. This is one of those things. It's an open circle where the circle is always expanding. And if you're in and you're here, you're just in and you're here. You will pick up on all the little details and nuances really quickly. If you want to get up to speed a little bit faster, you can go back and grab episodes 591, 592 and 593. That is a recent summary of the stuff that we've covered in the first 24 chapters of this breakdown of Matthew or even all the way back to the beginning, if you like it and just power through it and catch up either way. Hey, you're here. That's awesome. Super, super, super welcome. Thank you for being here. And now as is always the case, let's start with something that seems unrelated, but it's going to turn out to be related. You guys watch the office, the NBC version of the office. It was a funny show. You just say all the jokes. It was like the sweet spot in all of comedy history for that little window there in the early 2000s where we were kind of past the prudish, overly sensurious phase where you couldn't joke about things that were like part of the human experience and are frankly kind of funny. And it's probably worth joking about a little bit. But we also weren't to the point where everything was so very serious and anger inciting that then you couldn't joke about anything at all, but not because it would offend the people who it used to offend way back in the day, but now because it'll offend an entirely new crowd of offendable people. We just can't get out of our own way, can we? But the office got out of its own way. That show was hilarious. And I remember one of the episodes, I think it was Kevin, the big dude who spilled the chili. There may be a hockey rink or something and he was going to test for melanoma or prostate cancer or something. And then he gets the news. He's been kind of wondering how it's going to go and he comes over and he's like, well, it was negative. And Michael, the boss, Steve Carell's character, who's socially unaware and also goes really big. And that's the source of the comedy of the show. He takes the word negative to mean bad because it usually is bad and it gives him a big hug and the joke is that he doesn't understand the difference between a negative test and a positive test. And then when you're talking about medicine, you're hoping, generally speaking, for a negative test because it means you don't have the thing. I over explained the joke, but here's where it fits into what we're talking about. We're in Matthew chapter 24 and Jesus just employed language that seems kind of backwards. It seems like he's saying something positive. It seems like he's exhorting people to a certain state of mind, a certain perspective that is like, you know, good and Jesus-y. But he used an example that generally we think of as being bad and negative or at least morally confusing. The passage we're looking at is in Matthew 24, 42. This comes on the heels of Jesus giving a big long speech about how things are going to be. Like as we get toward the end of time, his history unfolds and what that means for the people who believe in Jesus and want to follow him, but they're like, I don't know where's it all going. He gives all of this talk about how you can know a few things, but there's a lot of things you're not going to know. And then he says, in light of all of that, that paraphrase is mine. No, he actually says this. Therefore keep watch because you don't know on what day your Lord will come talking about like the return of the son of man, the return of Jesus. But understand this, if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready because the son of man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. Okay, like the big picture theology stuff like in Jesus point, we covered all of that yesterday. I don't think it's very confusing at all. Like be alert and be ready. If you know a big thing is coming, you'll be more attentive than you normally would be. Something important won't sneak by you. But here in the analogy, the thief who comes and like breaks into somebody's house and steals stuff, which I think is generally regarded as, you know, bad is analogous to the son of man to the return of Christ. So in this analogy, I guess you or the disciples who Jesus is talking to would be the homeowner. So you got to be ready. So wait a minute. Does that mean the Bible sound like being a burglar is a good idea or that Jesus some kind of burglar? Obviously not. But it's one thing for me to just be like, well, I bought a microphone on the internet and I went to college one time and there were classes and so I'm pretty authoritative. But if I say it doesn't mean that, then it doesn't mean that because I said it and you can just rest easy. It's another thing entirely for us to just be like, we all have eyes and we can read things. So let's just look at other parts of the New Testament and see if this stands out as being like the one weird place where Jesus uses a negative example to illustrate a positive point or if there are others. And because there are still several minutes left to podcast time, you can probably guess, ha ha, there are others. This isn't the only time he does this. So let's look at the examples and think about why he does this from time to time. All right. One of my favorite parables in all of the gospels like like top two, I think Weet and the Tares is my favorite. I think this parable of the shrewd manager over in Luke 16 is my second best favorite ist. And this is one where Jesus tells a story about a rich man who has this manager who's accused of wasting his possession. So the guy's like a jerk and he's mismanaging things. And then the owner calls in the manager is like, Hey, what's this out here about you? You can't even account of your management because you can't be a manager longer. So he's going to can him. And then the manager has done a lousy job. It's like, Oh, what am I going to do? Like I'm going to get fired any minute. I'm in the process of being fired. I don't want to go out and be a beggar or dig ditches. It's paraphrases mine, but it's pretty close paraphrase. And this next part is not a paraphrase. He says, I know what I'll do so that when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses. So he starts calling people who do business with the landowner with this rich man and cutting them deals. Like, all right. You're debt. Well, you used to owe this now you owe this used to 20. Now you only owe 10. And everybody's like, I don't get it. But cool. Great. And then the moral of the story is that this shrewd manager had access to all of these resources for only a little bit more time. And he had the good sense to make moves while he still had access to those resources that he could not keep in order to parlay that into something that he could keep, something that would last longer. And the take home message from Jesus is essentially like, look, if this clown who was an immoral idiot had the good sense to do this, how much more so should people who are followers of mine, kingdom citizens, take these resources that you can only have for a little bit because you're going to die and everything's like, oh, your stuff's going to burn. It's all going away. How much more so should you have the good sense to use that for stuff that is going to last longer? But again, it's the Michael Scott, Kevin Malone situation where there's a little bit of ambiguity here by the way, negative positive. It's confusing. It's a negative example to illustrate a positive point in Luke 18. I'm going to have to go a little faster on these. I can make them all work. There's a story, a kind of a parable, an example given of an unjust judge who's like, I, yeah, I'm in bed. I don't know. I don't want to be bothered with things that are wrong with people. I work certain days a week. You can look me up then. But there's somebody who's like, no, I got to have justice right now and they're banging on the door and they're demanding justice. And eventually the unjust judge is like, okay, cool. I hear you. And here once again in Luke 18, it looks like, wait, are you saying that God is like an indifferent judge who really isn't paying attention? That's kind of a weird example of a negative positive, positive negative. Am I reading this thing right? But it would seem that there was some kind of motif, some sort of teaching style in the first century in the rabbinical world that Jesus is tapping into here that his original audience seems to have clearly understood, wherein you can use these examples of the stupid behavior of a clown, someone mockably dumb or immoral in society and be like, like, if they got it, how much more so as a good person who has their head screwed on straight, should you get it? You get the story of the laborers that we looked at a while back in Matthew chapter 20, where the boss hires people and he pays the people he hires right at the beginning of the workday, the same amount that the people he hires in like the last 45 minutes of the workday and some people I suppose could read that in light of their notions of economic morality be like, hey, that is super unjust and wrong. And maybe we could count that as another one of those places where it looks like a negative example is used to illustrate a positive point. Then you get the parable of the talents that we're going to get to in the next chapter, Matthew chapter 25, where the master gives certain resources to three different people and two of them get a return on it. And the third one's like, I didn't steal it or anything, I just buried it because I know how you get and I figured you wouldn't want me to lose it. So here it is back. It's all there. And the master is like, no, not impressed. And that guy gets in serious trouble. Well, isn't that a little bit mean? Is this a negative example used to illustrate a positive point? Maybe it counts. I think definitely this next example from Matthew 10 counts as one of these negative examples to illustrate a positive point. And that is just Matthew. I think it's verse 16, right? Matthew 10, 16. He sent you out like sheep among wolves, therefore be as shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves. Well, it wasn't the serpent that thing that's like, it's like the devil or something way back in the creation narrative. Like came and tricked the woman and like caused the fall of everything. And isn't the serpent going to have his head crushed by Jesus and the Bible say something like that somewhere? Like, why would you want to be like a serpent? Well, negative example to illustrate a positive point. And you got the parable of the wedding feast in Matthew chapter 22, which seems like it's really nice as you're going through it. But then as you get to the end, the host of the feast is like, Hey, well, what the heck? Why don't you have on like wedding clothes? We're going to do wedding clothes is a good feast. What do you think is some kind of like joke feast? I get them out of here. They throws the guy out. That one's a little more ambiguous because I think the original audience might have viewed that as being a positive example, illustrating a positive point. But I know lots of modern readers who interpret that as being one of these, again, negative examples to illustrate a positive point. Matthew 13, kingdom parables stuff. There are a bunch of big parables and micro parables in there. And one of the micro parables is the parable of the yeast. And it's about how yeast just like it works through everything. It doesn't take very much. Well, yeast or leaven throughout the Old Testament is bad. It's a metaphor for sin. So it seems like that parable counts as another one of those negative examples to illustrate a positive point. The point is though that this is not an isolated incident in Matthew chapter 24. And if it were, I think I would throw into confusion and already kind of confusing and difficult chapter in Matthew 24. But because we've seen a lot of this rhetorical, rabbinical device of using a negative example to illustrate a positive point through the structure of saying, if this thing that is obviously bad and people who do bad can get this right, how much more so should you who want to do what's right and are clever be able to get this thing right. And so in light of that, I think it's pretty safe to say that Jesus isn't like, Oh, burgling is good. I think of myself as a burglar who burgles things. And though it's very fun to use a passage like this to just pause for an episode here and note this pattern and this theme that runs throughout. And it's just one more little detail that we're catching. Hopefully makes us understand it better. Still, the larger point of this passage in Matthew chapter 24 is very, very simple. It's spelled out in Matthew 24 42 right here at the beginning of this whole thief and homeowner business. And it just says, therefore keep watch because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. And he summarizes it again at the end of this analogy saying, so you also must be ready because the son of man will come in an hour when you do not expect him.
