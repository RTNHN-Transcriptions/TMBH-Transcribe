This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we're working on goodness. We started on it yesterday And we're gonna finish it today and you might think why would that take two days? I didn't listen to yesterday's episode tell me how that could take two days because goodness seems really obvious. It's just you know Not bad Why couldn't you have just said that goodness just means not badness? Then we all could have pictured things that are bad and know that it's just not that and that we get it done Well, the reason is because the word good is mushy in English It's lost punch and meaning but it had punch and meaning in the Bible in the original languages So we're bouncing around the Bible yesterday and today trying to get a sense of what was really meant how the original audience would have understood Goodness on this list of the fruit of the spirit. I feel like if we don't do that We're gonna cheat ourselves out of something that's on this elite list that clearly we're supposed to understand Because it's on this list the beautiful perfect attributes of God that he imparts to people So we're gonna pick up right where we left off yesterday after my close personal friend Jeffrey Foote Play some sassy music here we go Matthew 5 16. Oh, I mean you can piece together what this one is. It's one verse before The key verse of the book of Matthew and the first of the big five speeches around which the book of Matthew is structured Matthew 5 16 in the same way let your light shine before men so that they may see your good deeds and Praise your father in heaven. That's nice Maybe that's nice thing kind of applies here that people would look at it and they would give it a Shirley Bennett That's nice. I mean, it's better than not nice and sometimes you just don't know me Maybe not you but me sometimes I'll try to do this stupid edgy thing where I'm like, yeah The obvious way to say it is obvious and the obvious little nicety in this conversation is obvious So I'm gonna try to be not obvious and clever and nice nice by clever And that usually backfires on me I need to probably put a bullet in that social practice and just go right through the front door with obvious nice every time but There's something to be said for just the universal language of the stuff that people look at and they're like, yeah That's good and that's bad. That's pleasant and that's unpleasant and to just do things or communicate in such a way out of consideration that it models things that are good and pleasant I don't know staying in Matthew for just a minute Here's another one that immediately comes to mind when you think about the idea of goodness in the Bible It's remember Matthew 25 the passage about the talents the three different servants get given three different amounts to invest and take care of by the master and Two of them do a good job one of them does a lousy job and what does Jesus say to the people who handle or what does the master say To the servants who handle that investment right who are vested properly says well done Good and faithful servant And I'm not gonna lie. I want to hear that someday. I think about that one a lot It lives in my head. Well, there's that word good again and the Greek on that one is agathos So it's identical to the word good or goodness as it were that's used in the fruit of the spirit passage So we've been working on and just because I can and because it's interesting thematically I'm gonna bounce back to the beginning of Matthew for just a minute Matthew three Ten and this is John the Baptist talking here But looking at the language lines up with what we're dealing with with the fruit of the spirit thing John's out baptizing people the Pharisees and the Sadducees Come to check it out and he yells at him John the Baptist says you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming wrath produce Fruit in keeping with repentance and don't think you can say to yourselves. We have Abraham is our father I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham The axe is already at the root of the tree and every tree that does not produce good fruit Will be cut down and thrown into the fire that imagery is pretty interesting, right? We had the stuff the other day with the vine and the branches from the middle of the gospel of John like 14 15 and 16 All of that seems to undergird the fruit of the spirit passage But also these words of John the Baptist seem connected to the middle of John And they seem connected to the fruit of the spirit stuff in Galatian chapter 5 and what do you know? Good or goodness or these qualities that make a fruit observably and Obviously what it's supposed to be and right. That's the measurement that's to be used on What it would look like to get it right according to John the Baptist produce Good fruit as like this concept and it's not just here I mean Peter was in attendance and Matthew chapter 5 in the sermon on the Mount and clearly he internalized this idea of budding the goodness of God the good things that God builds in you as a follower of God show before other people not necessarily to impress everybody But to point people to God and Peter closely and directly links goodness with other fruit of the spirit that we've talked about One example is first Peter 3 11 where he says he must turn from evil and do good He must seek peace and pursue it And so Peter's likening goodness or connecting goodness to another fruit of the spirit there in peace but also his idea throughout is hey You guys are suffering and you might suffer more if that happens let it be because of The goodness that you're doing the stuff that looks like Jesus and don't let it be because you're being idiots All right, here's another pretty obvious one that you probably already thought of and we're shrieking and you're sweaty unit hard on the treadmill at the gym Luke 1819 this one's come up a lot of late as we've been working on Galatians here. Why do you call me good? Jesus answered no one's good except God alone Huh? Well there it is. I mean that means that God is more than nice Like surely the concept here is more significant than that's nice because God is more than trite likable safe H. R. Nice. He's good virtuous beautiful symmetrical ordered beneficial all of those concepts anything good that you can think of from ancient world notions of good God is that and really God alone is Truly all of those things in his perfection and then and then finally and I'm not gonna read the whole thing There's the good shepherd passage in John 10. I am The good shepherd says Jesus the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep So when he sees the wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it the man runs away because he's a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep know me. That's a pretty beautiful pretty powerful passage where Jesus clearly thinks the word good is enough to carry the meaning of A shepherd who gets it right a shepherd who gets it perfect frankly So I don't think that the best way to read Galatians 5 and the list of the fruit of the spirit when we get to goodness is Necessarily perfection like the perfection of God But what do we see is a theme between all of this stuff? It's peaceful. It's beautiful It's virtuous. It's demonstrative of kingdom values when something is good It hangs together. It's right intuitively Right virtuously right Aesthetically right. I don't know piece it together. It's kind of a tricky one. The point is it is so much more than how this word comes off in English as nice or fair and when we see the word goodness it functions It's kind of a Rorschach test an ink blot on a page. We're gonna look at that and be like that's good That's not good with whatever Maybe political or social alignments we might have today will kind of inflict that on the word in English It's a pretty weak and abused word in English at this point But it was a rich and robust word in the source language that we're looking at here in this material And just because the words been tamed a little bit in our language It doesn't mean the concept should be tamed. We're supposed to read this and be like dang That's beautiful and we want that and that is one of the attributes of God that is imparted to us as we walk by the spirit Alright, I think that was a pretty good episode I'm at peace with all of this and I hope Jeff Somewhere along the way here has given us some pretty good music to work with as well.
