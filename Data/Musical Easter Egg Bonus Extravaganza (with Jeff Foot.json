Hey everybody, I'm Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast And I am joined by my close personal friend Jeff Foot in Jeff Foot's basement and studio Hey buddy, Howdy This is a weird episode, if this is your first time ever on the podcast This isn't what we normally do, normally we work our way through a book of the Bible a little bit every weekday morning This time around however, we are resolving a contest, a game that we put out there for everybody to play Jeff, would you please walk us through how the game works? Absolutely This is a weird one today because we're going to be talking about obscure music that most people probably don't care about But some people do, and enough people did that they sent in answers to a contest that we had Because at the end of some episodes, instead of the regular outro music, we do Easter eggs That feature songs related to something you say in the episode And a lot of times when I'm editing, I'll hear you say something in the episode that just requires a musical Easter egg But it doesn't require it, you just can't help it Yeah, that's true, I cannot help it, I like hearing that But yeah, so what we had over the course of the 400 episodes, we had a couple dozen of those Easter eggs And so the contest was, can you figure out what the song is and why it's in that particular episode? Yeah, and the winner is getting cool stuff, and I will now announce what the cool stuff is The winner is getting a loaded Nintendo classic, like the Grey Box Nintendo, straight up, mailed to you That you get to then play video games on, and also some cool TMBH merch that I think is cool anyway As well as, well something special that we'll reveal at the end of the episode here today It's gonna be very exciting I mean, it's a worthwhile prize pack, and if you want the ice cream sandwich that I mentioned several episodes earlier As a prize is gonna get gross, but I can do it So I have some questions for you before we dive into the answers Do you remember how this got started? No, I do not remember how this gets started I remember you texted me and said, I need the Princess Bride sword fighting music Oh yeah, because I did the one where I did the horrible voice acting for the intro, that was bad And then like a couple episodes later, you were talking about Jesus' reputation And I could not get Joan Jett out of my head No, that has a swear in it So that's why we did it without vocals That's good, and nobody got mad And then it just took off from there Okay, second question, are there any that you know of that we didn't air? Yeah, we didn't air, you did head over heels by Cheers for fear Cheers for fears on the John the Baptist execution episode Would have gone awesome It's too soon It's too soon A little too soon Yeah, maybe in 30, 21 That will be appropriate to joke about that stuff Okay, final question How did we get through 400 episodes of you and me and not do a Tom Petty song? Have we really not? We have really not Oh, that's lousy We should make one of those, I'm gonna find an excuse Okay, you watch Sometime in the next one or two weeks I will say something that completely fits into what we're talking about But it will really serve the other purpose of giving you an excuse to make song And it's not gonna be freefallen, so don't even But you do that sometimes where you hope that I'll pick up on it and do the song Yes And we've had that Have UHF The UHF soundtrack stuff I don't know what I said, like red snappers or supplies Or something But it was some line from Cooney on UHF And there's no way that's getting past me No, no, clearly not Okay, so here's what we're gonna do I have already eliminated several contestants There were a ton of entries And we've got a few here that serve as a really nice template And I've poked around at some of these So we are going to start With the first entrant The deal was that you just email me your guests as to what the songs meant And why they were in the episodes And these are not direct covers, right Jeff? No, a lot of times it's just based on my memory Of how I remember that song Occasionally you'll ask me to do a song I've never heard before And I'll give it maybe two plays through And then I just try to replicate it as best as I can remember so that it isn't too close I'm changing the instrumentation obviously, we're doing it without vocals But I don't want to just create a karaoke track, cause then it would be a cover I try to make it my own somehow Yeah, a little pastiche, a little homage, which makes it more fun I think people need to understand our formula for this musically Please? We are aiming for the perfect cross section of Impressive Mm-hmm And dumb I don't know, maybe we should talk about this again, but I'm just going to throw it in right here You made all this music, people are going to want to find your music Where do they go and get Jeff Foote music? The best place to find the music, it's on Spotify, it's on YouTube But if you'd like to purchase it, it's on Bandcamp under my name, Jeff Foote It's called Sea of Tranquility Sea of Tranquility is the album that's up there on Bandcamp And that's the music that we use all over the podcast Correct Which is great, thank you buddy Okay, what are we talking about? The first entrant was Matthew Lore And I've got his entry right here, we're going to go through a few of these Early going, he's got a bunch right, wow Matthew is being very, very thorough We're talking about references to the Psalms project stuff that we did with Shane Heilman That we promoted a little bit, it's still good stuff He keeps putting out new things and it's going very well I do not want to claim credit for that, that was actually really good That was actually excellent, thoughtful and has lyrics and it's great He's rightly identified, all of your stuff Ignition sequence is the normal outro music, right? Correct Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh Exactly Okay, so here we go Bad reputation, don't get in the black hearts because you talk about one's reputation Alright, so, yeah, Matthew is getting the drill, that is correct I've been through most of this, Cats in the Cradle, that one appeared twice That's one of my favorites It's a really good cover, I like that you added the kitty sound That was episode 210, Matthew rightly points out that episode 211 was what I think might be my favorite song that you've done It's the homage to I'll make a man out of you from Mulan As sung by, who's the original, Donnie Osmond Donnie Osmond, and the song was written by Matthew Wilder Who also performed famously in the 1980s, Break My Stride Which is also another one of the pastitias that you did Oh, a recent one, yeah, very good at that, very good at that Yeah, and that is the ringtone on my phone for you, by the way, when you call it's the Mulan Yeah, Lord of the Rings, he's getting all the reasons right He got the Zelda theme right from 219 That was the hardest one you gave me, by the way Really? Yeah The chords in that, the way the melody goes, is so not like anything else Which one do we do, we did the Hyrule theme, right? Yeah That's beautiful, man There's a lot of notes in that one that don't follow any sort of scale Which is probably why it's so catchy, because it doesn't sound like anything else Okay, Matthew struggled a little bit down the home stretch Looks like he missed 0397, he listed that as After Taxes by Johnny Cash But that was a very unique cover, and the song was actually Taxman by the Beatles, and it's a unique cover because we did that one in my house Yeah, we were at your house, and I didn't have any of my gear, you just had an acoustic guitar, so we stuck a microphone on it and went Yeah, it worked out, we had fun 0396, he correctly identified as Cabo Wabo by Van Halen Is that Van Hagar? Or is that Van Hagar? That was the only way to do that Well, yeah, I soon asked the question, I felt bad, because that's Cabo in it, everything Cabo's, San Diego He correctly identified as episode 0395, which was a listener question episode as Some of your questions by Jeff Foote Oh yeah, that's a good one, that's a real good one Yeah, Matt answers all of your questions, okay, maybe not all of your questions Not all of your questions, I mean, that one was fun Time constraints here Alright, he correctly identified 0390 when you believe from Prince of Egypt 0385, he had as dreams by Fleetwood Mac This is a massive stretch, but I searched for things having to do with dreams Okay, so he knows it's probably not dreams by Fleetwood Mac No, 0385 would have been Matthew Wilder that we talked about a bit ago with Break My Stride But I don't remember Prince of Egypt Yeah, we talked about the Mariah Carey song, there can be miracles when you believe That one? Surely you did that, right? I don't think I did, but I definitely talked about it in that episode, so it would make the most sense Let's see, what did we do, that was 0390? It's Mike and the mechanics All he needed is a miracle, I see what we did Okay, that's a good guess, but a strike against you, Matt See, sorry, when in doubt always err in the sight of 80s Mm-hmm, 0381, he's got the lion sleeps tonight, I don't think that's what it was That was the Bastille song we were talking about, right? I think 0381 was probably the one that stuck most people Um, well let's go through some more of these answer sheets and see what we get Nate Jakobe Awesome I think that's uh honorable mention I think that lands him in the honorable mention what I'm looking at here is a spreadsheet with 400 lines with the answer to every single episode being never going to give you up by Rick Astley. You're a good person Nate. You're a very good person. Oh dear. Bo, Fras, I think I don't know. Hopefully I'm saying that right Bo. I'm impressed that Bo correctly got all the components of episode 3, 6, 9, which had cold as ice. Hot and cold by Katy Perry and hot blooded. So it's Katy Perry with foreigner on either side. Yeah, that was a fun one. Yeah, he got 236. 236 is a really tricky one. I haven't seen anybody nail it, but Bo is close. 236 I specifically contacted you and was like, hey, I need here I go again by white snake. Yep, but the game of throwing speed. That's a very solid entry from Bo. He is among the finalists. Zachary Stewart's entry right here, also among the finalists. He got the careless whisper Wham montage from 278. Did he also get the last Christmas on the fadeout? I don't think he mentions it. That was an Easter egg within an Easter egg. Yeah, you do that. You did that with aha tag at the end of blinding lights by the weekend. It really is the same song. This is a really solid showing here from Brian Villanueva. Where are the rings? Zelda. Oh, you got the, what does the fox say? Animal medley? That was a good showing. The Optimus Prime episode. Man, and the answers are really good on this one. He got secret ambition. The Michael W. Smith cover. I didn't think a lot of people would get that. That's pretty obscure old school Christian pop music in the days of 80s youth group. And that's one where you stuck an obscure lyric in the episode. I did. Yeah, he's got beautiful disaster. Episode 311 was by 311. Yep, he got One Night in Bangkok by Murray Head. That was a difficult one from episode 345. Got both parts of the white stripes cover episode 359, which is a seven nation army and fell in love with the girl. So on the white stripes, yes, there is an Easter egg within that Easter egg. And the third riff in that is a rack and tours song. Oh, you're right. Jack White also played in that. Yep. Yep. You're right. We got a great entry here from Mukapie Ian. Yeah, all I have is the email address. I don't know what that means, but it was a very good entry with a ton of detail and a really good showing on the rationale. I want to give a shout out to JP Job, who got several of these right, but ultimately not enough to be in competition for the victory. However, he made a rough sketch of a t-shirt idea for Millstone Harbor daycare. It says Matthew 18, six. That's outstanding. That's awesome. That makes me irrationally happy. So I have a question. There's a couple. I was just I'm going through my list here that I thought might be a little too hard for people to get. And then maybe we should talk about in case people were stuck. All right, let's do it. Yeah. Give me the difficult ones. You mentioned Johnny Cash covering the nine inch nails. Yes. And then I did the nine inch nails version, not the Johnny Cash version. Yes. And this entrant nails that. Listen to this entry. Matt mentions the phrase, my empire of dirt from hurt by nine inch nails or covered by Johnny Cash parentheses. I prefer the Cash version as a quote that would have cache with those. I mean, this is a good entry. Absolutely. But that was one I should confess. I am not going to try to cover Johnny Cash covering hurt because that's one of the greatest songs ever. The original or the cover? The cover. The cover is one of the greatest songs ever. But I wasn't going to touch that with a 100 foot pull. That's why I went back to the original. Another one is the James Horner sound. Yeah. And a lot of people assumed it was Braveheart because we talked about Braveheart. But we should have been also talked about Edward Zwick's glory. Glory. So I pulled an audible. James Horner did the soundtrack for both of those also famous for Apollo 13. He did Titanic. There we go. That's significant. You did a whole thing on Robert the Bruce. Yes. Which lends itself to Braveheart. Yes. I want to fight as he does. I remember that one. You sent me a text saying, hey, there's this great band out there that does Viking metal. Yes. Sabaton. And can you do the Braveheart theme over this idea? And I said, no, because Glory is the greatest soundtrack of all time, which I agree with. And James Horner plagiarized himself on Braveheart. Fine. So we did the Viking metal. It's the line up before the storming of Fort Wagner from Glory. That's a hot pipe Braveheart during the execution. So I think if anyone gets Braveheart, we should give him credit. I think that's fair. I could not tell the two apart by humming them. That's a wonderful homage you did on that one, by the way. There's a really good entry from Dustin Coates, who went out of his way to figure out each of the songs you did on your album. That was nice. There's theme music for each day. Bonus points. I'm sure everybody's figured out that we use the same music on each day of the week. Some people have even told me that they can detect which day that episode was from because they're so in the rhythm with it, which is awesome. So that was a very good entry. Jeff Brock had a good entry that made it to my finals list. Love the fact that Jeff got every element of the muse, a montage that you did in episode 305 that started with, do you remember? It started with Stockholm Syndrome. Yep, it sounds like chaos. It's so good. And then my favorite rock song of the 2000s came in second. Starlight. I adore this song. It's so pure. It's so good. It's so clean. I love this. Oh, and the Knights of Sidon. Wow. Muse is good at rock. Excellent. And that one, you basically just bragged about muse for half of that episode. That's an episode well spent. I mean, you think about it, every one of these melodies exists in the ether. God knew all of these melodies existed before creation and time were put in place. And so when a musician goes and finds that hook, that riff, that little thing, they're not inventing it. They're not writing it. They are discovering it and drawing it from out of the eternal ether of the mind and creation and possibilities that God has given in the physical world. It's a moment of supreme union with the divine when someone writes an amazing hook or an amazing riff. And then there's other stuff that I think maybe God in his sovereignty was like, all right, Lucifer Prince of darkness. I'm going to let you just write some garbage. And I think that's probably what Lincoln Park tapped into. I thought for sure you were going to go matchbox 20. That would be my second one. Those are the two. Those are the two I cannot abide. Ooh, matchbox 20. I hope you don't like your rock to rock. Adam, I assume I say Sequoia. That's a really cool last name. Had an entry that made it to the finals as well. Did not quite rise to the level of those other two and Thomas Birch. Man, this is a good entry. Episode 271, careless whisper by Wham. Voices carried by Till Tuesday. Matt relates how Jesus fulfills Isaiah's prophecy of how the Messiah will come as a meek, peaceful man will not shout or cry out or raise his voice in the streets. He will not utter a careless whisper and he will hush, hush, keep it down now because his voice is carried. Oh my goodness. That's such a good answer. Okay, that one be oh, that's such a good answer. Oh, it's wonderful. All right, last one that needs our attention is Ali and her entry is very thorough. I'm going through all of the touchy ones here. Man, it's a good showing. She get the cars. Of course, she got the cars. Well, that's good. Janet Jackson. Yes. And she's rolling her eyes at you for even asking. Yeah. Okay. Out of the finals, I found three really solid final, final finalists. But ultimately, I have landed on my winner. And before I announce that, what else do we need to discuss about this? I had promised when I was doing some voiceovers while you were on vacation, that the winner will get a song written in their honor. Yes. And then you had the idea this week, the runners up get a song for themselves as well. Yeah, I think so too. And I think everybody we've talked about today belongs on that list. And their lists were so good that they deserve a song. They deserve a song. I mean, something to express admiration and appreciation for the hard work they put in. That's right. Jeff, just were you able to prepare something? I absolutely was. Kali, could we listen to that now in honor of the people who finished second and third? And I guess I don't really know how else to announce this other than to say who the second and third place winners are, please. Okay. Well, tying for a second are going to be Dustin Coates and Ali Mulemberg. And your answers were spectacular. But there was one person who put together such an impressive list that they bested even the two of you. I am so grateful that you participated. Dustin and Ali Dustin and Ali. Yeah. They belong in a world of winners. They do belong in a world of winners. So with that announcement made, Dustin, Ali, this one's for you. Second place. Put in the time. But still you lost. And now you're full of shame. Here's to you. The losing fuel. Do they quit the game? We belong in a world of winners that won't fade away. Yes, we belong in a world of winners just like John the Way. We belong in a world of winners that won't fade away. Yes, we belong in a world of winners just like I said, just like come on, just like John the Way. Which brings us to our grand champion finalist winner in a world of winners. This person is the actual winner. The actual winner, much like John O'Way, it's Douglas Sewell who put together an incredibly detailed, incredibly accurate list. I can't imagine the work that went into this. I think it's possible that Douglas would beat me at this. And it's my podcast. So nice job, Douglas. Awesome, Douglas. You crushed it. We're going to close with this winners anthem to Douglas. I am going to need a mailing address from Dustin and Ali. I'm also going to need a mailing address from you, Douglas, everyone who participated. Thank you so much, Jeff. Thank you so much for making great music or it is always fun making pastitias and homages to other people's great music. And thank you, everybody, listen to the podcast and who was up for hanging around and participating in a very goofy, very different episode this time around. With that, our grand champion, Douglas Sewell, this song is not just dedicated to you. It was written for you. Congratulations. Don't you want to be like him? Don't you want to be like him some day? Don't you wanna be like him? Don't you wanna be like him someday? Someday Someday Someday Come on now Hey Hey Hey Hey Oh What? Talk to me Yeah That's the way this one works good Don't you wanna be like him? Don't you wanna be like him someday? Someday Don't you wanna be like him? Don't you wanna be like him someday? Don't you wanna be like him someday?
