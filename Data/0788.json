This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and in the Lion King, there are two scenes, maybe three, you could argue, that composite together to convey the commissioning that Simba receives from Mufasa. And I suppose those are one when they go up on a high place and they look out over everything and Simba is told what the deal is like, hey, you're going to be a king, you need to take your place among the kings and assume your role within the kingdom. You're getting closer to that moment. And then we get the lecture after Simba misses the point and instead celebrates what he's going to get and the place of esteem he is going to receive. But in doing so, he jeopardizes people in his care, people, lions in his care, namely Nala. And then in that second part of the commissioning, we see that Mufasa calls him over and he's like, you know, I'm going to teach my son a lesson. And Simba's walking over to teach the lesson, his little tiny baby paw steps in Mufasa's great big giant paw print. And there's kind of this sense of, dang, I got a long ways to go. I might not be ready for this. But then there's a restoration that occurs with that scene ending with them romping around and wrestling and fighting and all of that stuff. And then finally, there's the commissioning after Mufasa's death that happens out in the wilds when Simba has blown it when he retreats from his responsibility, when he doesn't play the right role in Mufasa's moment of need. And there the commissioning from beyond death is absolutely certain. You need to go back and you need to take your place and play this role in the kingdom. Am I laying it on too thick? Because I mean, it's right there, right? Come on. Likewise, in Matthew chapter 28, what we're seeing is the completion of a commissioning motif that is played out throughout all of the book of Matthew. We get brash disciples in the early going who think they know how the things are. One in particular is always telling Jesus how the things are. Clearly, there is a spiritual family, a new family of faith motif throughout Matthew as well. And so where Mufasa is Simba's literal father, Jesus is the spiritual father of this new family of faith towards his sons, the disciples. But like Simba, they screw a bunch of stuff up and gradually realize the grandeur of who it is they're following and gradually realize their inability to drink from the cup he's drinking from. They can't go where he's going. It can't truly be what he is. Their role is going to be different. And then ultimately and finally after in both stories, the king dies. There is a final and ultimate and complete commissioning that occurs after that includes restoration and affirmation after all kinds of failure on the parts of the sons in both stories. And what we're getting into in the very last thing in Matthew chapter 28, it's really the only character arc, the only story arc that needs to be addressed here that hasn't yet been addressed. How do we move forward? What role did the disciples play in this? How will the kingdom be established without Jesus physically being around? Is it increasingly looks like he isn't going to be even after his resurrection? Now, we talked a couple of conversations ago about how the theme, the narrative theme of the judgment of the religious leaders and their temple system and all of that was on the horizon. But that isn't resolved in the New Testament. The New Testament seems content to treat that as foreshadowing. Maybe even you could argue prophecy. The take home point here doesn't seem to be the religious leadership is going to lose and you need to see them lose. It's just lumped in with the world kingdom system, all of which is predicted to have the same fate entropy. Second law of thermodynamics is going to burn. It's not going to work out. It cannot sustain itself. No matter how much force is exerted or violence is wielded, the world kingdom is going to world kingdom itself. It will implode the kingdom kingdom then is more than even just a life raft to get out of that system. It rather is the fulfillment of everything that in a twisted, weird backwards kind of way, the world kingdom aspires to be or unintentionally points toward. So acknowledging that that narrative theme of judgment of the religious leadership is something that the text seems completely comfortable with just letting unfold like everything else about the world kingdom will unfold. We just have a few things that need to be wrapped up and in Matthew chapter 28, they're getting wrapped up. But really, I'm underselling it. It's more than wrapping up. It's exciting. It's the culmination of the story. It's the setup for everything that happens next. And it starts in verse 16. Then the 11 disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. Now in spite of that, the very next thing that happens is that Jesus is going to say, all authority on heaven on earth has been given to him. And then he's going to commission them in the same way. And if they're all in a grander way, then Mufasa from beyond death commissions, Simba in the Lion King. But first we got to acknowledge even with everything that's happened, they are still doubting. What are we supposed to do with that as readers? Do you think we're supposed to look at you? Do you think Matthew wanted us to get to that and be like, they're just idiots. They cannot get things right. It doesn't matter how much they see, even if somebody comes back from the dead. It does not guarantee their belief. Well, maybe he does want us to take that from it. Maybe he does want us to view it not so much as a commentary on how uniquely bad it believed these guys were, but as a commentary on our capacity for belief and for understanding beyond the physical world in general, that people are frail. And if intellectual assent is the bedrock of faith in Christ, that will ultimately be insufficient because intellectual assent for us who didn't get to see any of this stuff. Most of us wobble. It's not as simple as just a straight upward trajectory on some kind of belief graph for most people, maybe for some, I believe that could happen. That's great. Most people, I think doubt is part of the equation, I think part of Matthew's point here in telling us that this doubt was ongoing was at least in part, so, to be logical in nature. That's a fancy word for stuff about salvation, that even as these guys are about to be commissioned to go and be the first great ambassadors of the kingdom and it all kind of hinges on them. And God, according to the text, obviously, but from a pieces on the board game kind of perspective, it hinges on them, even as they are about to be commissioned in that environment. Still, their intellectual assent wobbles at times, meaning that this must be about more than raw intellectual assent. And I think we get a sense of what that more is when we see the raw, almost inexplicable belief that we get from the little children waving the palm branches. You know, Hosanna, blessed to see who comes in the name of the Lord is son of David from the blind guys who can't even see who Jesus is or what he's doing, but they can see more clearly than the Pharisees. Then they call him the son of David from the Canaanite woman in chapter 15. It wasn't around for any of this stuff, but she somehow has belief and knows who she's looking at. The centurion in chapter eight, the leper right next door to him in terms of chronology in chapter eight, how did they know how that would they know to take such a bold public risk while it was beyond intellectual assent. But it's kind of hard to put into words how in Matthew 16, Jesus indicates that Peter got stuff right about Jesus and his belief about Jesus, not just through raw intellectual exercise. I mean, obviously that was part of it. Peter had seen what he'd seen. Jesus made it clear repeatedly that you should be able to look at the signs and read them just like you can look at the weather and read the weather until what's coming next. So you should be able to look at like people coming back from the grave, like what he says when he cites from Isaiah when John the Baptist disciples come and ask him, he's a real deal. Like the, you know, the lame walk, the deaf here, the blind see, the dead are raised. Like you should intellectually be able to do the math, but that that secret sauce, that component of belief, the one that is difficult for people who are wired like me, even people who've been around this for a very long time, that component seems to be addressed in the confession of Christ that we get from Peter in chapter 16. Remember Peter makes that confession. Everybody else is too afraid to say it or just doesn't know that Peter connects the dots or at least it looks like he's connecting the dots and he's like, you're the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God, then Jesus affirms it. But then he affirms it even further. It's a compliment that Jesus goes on to say, and that's not even from you that was revealed to you. The belief component seems to have a miraculous component to it. And the thrust of the text seems to indicate that that is a forward moving miracle that somehow the space between the physical and the supernatural realm of God is bridged by God's unique work in the realm of belief, something that transcends just the chemicals in our brains and transcends just simply raw intellectual scent. So what kind of doubt did they have? Well, I mean, you're asking them to believe something very difficult. Somebody came back to life, but also they're saying they're right there looking at him. Actually, some of the doubt was about God's ability to deliver on the stuff that they probably kind of suspected they were going to have to do next or felt compelled to do next. Somebody was probably self doubt insecurity. You have Peter drips with insecurity throughout the text. He's constantly overcompensating to demonstrate that he can handle his business and should be taken seriously by Jesus. I don't think this doubt was as simple as I don't believe enough. I don't think this doubt was as simple as I don't intellectually have everything sorted out enough. I don't think this doubt was as simple as I just can't picture where this goes or how it unfolds from here. I don't think this doubt was as simple as him saying, I don't believe in my own capacities. I don't know if I'm talented enough or have enough of even a work ethic to deliver on the stuff that is in front of me. It's just too much. I'm overwhelmed. I think it was probably a mixture of all kinds of things like that and other stuff that I'm not empathetic enough to think of right here off the cuff. I think it wasn't just Thomas we're talking about here. I think this is something that every last one of them are feeling as we approach, much like the Lion King with the three phase commissioning, this final and complete phase of their restoration and commissioning. I think it's a beautifully human moment that the last thing we hear before they are commissioned to go off and do the stuff that they are supposed to do, which is indeed grand, is that some of them were doubting. We probably aren't done talking about that part just yet. We'll see where it goes next. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Let's do this again.
