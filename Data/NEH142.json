This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast and I hope stuff is going awesome for you. The world is hard to put your finger on what exactly the state of the world is right now. I'm not sure anybody really gets it, but it seems like when you read things about the news in the state of the world that looks bad at times, but then when I walk out my front door and talk with people, it seems like people are pretty cool and there's a lot of beautiful, rich things going on. So I don't know how it actually is. I'm not sure there's a way to even say how all the things actually are. All I can say is that sometimes in my country, at least seems like every four years, we've just about healed up from the damage we did to each other the last time we had an election and now all the wounds get pulled back open just before they're finished knitting and we're as I'm recording this, we're an election year and crazy things are happening. And so I don't know. I guess I just wanted to turn on the microphone before we talk about Nehemiah and be like, I hope things are going well. I hope you're finding richness in your time with your family and the people that you love. I hope that you're seeing the beauty of what God has made. I hope you're drinking deeply of beautiful art and redemptive things. And I hope that you are able to feel a sense of lightness and peace in the middle of a bunch of news stories and news cycles and things that maybe aren't trying to inspire such feelings of peace and grace in you. So yep, you've been on my mind over the weekend as modern events have unfolded. And I found myself hoping that things are going well. Okay, Nehemiah 12. We've got a big ceremony here in the second half of this chapter where the descendants of Abraham are rededicating these walls that they just at breakneck speed got built under the leadership of the temporary governor Nehemiah. When I got here in preparation for the conversations we've been having about this book, I had to pause for a moment and think, wait, have we not rededicated the walls yet? Surely we've done this by now, right? Because we're in Nehemiah chapter 12 and the walls are getting built. I mean, the first build montage in Nehemiah is all the way back in chapter three. Okay. So what do we got? Nehemiah three opens with Elia Sheeb, the high priest and his fellow priests. They go to work and they rebuild the cheap gate, says they dedicated it and said it's doors in place building as far as the tower of the hundred and it goes on and on and on. And there's so many names in here now, by the way, in chapter three, who I remember in this build montage because of that song that we did the other day to Koa, Bana, everybody remembers Bana. Messulam is in here. Malchaija. Remember that because it rhymes with Jedidiah who's also in here. I always particularly remember Melchaija because he's the guy who was in charge of the dungate. But then we go through chapter four and there's people attacking him and trying to keep him from building the wall in chapter six. And you get to the end of chapter six. I'm still trying to, I'm looking like, didn't, have we not rededicated this yet? Okay. Chapter six, verse 15. So the wall was completed on the 25th day of Elul and 52 days. Okay. Again, awesome. When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self confidence because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God. Okay. You should celebrate that. You think God built up these walls through his miraculous providence. You should celebrate it. Probably the next line will be a dedication here in the MI six, but no, it's just more trouble. Also, in those days, the nobles of Judah, we're sending many letters to Tobias. That's right. Tobias remember him. He was a jerk who was causing problems. So no, there's nothing in chapter six where we dedicate them. And then in chapter seven, Nehemiah says after the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, I had pointed gatekeepers and Levites and then he goes into a long list of people that he's trying to get to move back into Jerusalem. Okay. Then we go to chapter eight and we get the September 27th, 444 BC thing, the big reading of the law. And then through the rest of eight, people are crying and then Nehemiah and Ezra are like, don't cry. It's time to be happy. And they're like, okay, our bad. And then they're happy for a while. And they're like, okay, now cry. And then all the people are like, okay, that's what we actually want to do all along. And then they cry and they're sad. And then in chapter nine, there's that big mass repentance where they follow the prayer of Ezra and everybody praise it together. And like, we accept your narrative. We were wrong. You were right. But there's no dedication in there. No dedication to the walls that isn't in chapter 10. Yeah, you get all the details about the covenant that we went through about how they were going to pay for all of this stuff and what the ground rules were going to be. And then in chapter 11, which we just got done with, they go through the names of the people who were going to resettle Jerusalem and the areas around Jerusalem. And then we're into chapter 12. That's it. Huh. It's a good thing. I was not in charge of this rebuilding project because I would have forgotten to rededicate the walls. This totally slipped my mind. Well, thankfully it didn't slip Nehemiah's mind. It looks like he put a lot of thought into this thing. And here's how it goes. Nehemiah 1227 at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they had lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication songs of Thanksgiving and with the music of symbols, harps and liars, not like people who lie, but like L Y R E S. So the Levites, a lot of those guys are going to be centered around the temple itself, but they're priestly roles and work to be done outside the walls of Jerusalem as well. So we're bringing everybody in every, all the whole religious class is going to have ownership of this dedication together because of the walls aren't just about the people who live inside them. That's the message that's being sent. The walls are about a whole people group, whether they are inside them or traveling abroad outside them. The singers also were brought together from the regions around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Natofa fights, from Beth Gilgal and from the area of Giba and Azmabeth for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. What? How fun. I did not remember that detail. Remember a page earlier in chapter 11, we discovered that there was a place called the Valley of the Craftsman, which I think is the coolest sounding thing ever. It was a guild camp. It was where a whole bunch of people who did similar trades got together and compared notes and built things and collaborated. Awesome. Well, now we turn the page and we find out that there's also some kind of thriving music scene village, probably of people who were taking the ancient Psalms and putting them to music in different ways. It's like Seattle with Grunge Rock in the early 90s or the Saddle Creek Omaha, indie rock, bright eyes scene of the early 2000s. They had one of those that becomes one of these fertile breeding grounds for creativity where everybody's ideas are inspiring. Everybody else's ideas. What it tells me when I find out that there were little villages for the musicians that they had built is that they were really taking their craft seriously and that this was a moment of artistic flourishing. It's going to be pretty cool when all these people were putting all their talents into this and collaborating together come out and actually show you what they've been working on. That is coming up here in this ceremony just a few verses away. Verse 30, when the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall. Cool. That book ends very neatly. Remember the beginning of chapter three, the build montage for the wall? It opens with Elia Sheeb, the high priest and his fellow priests went to work to rebuild the cheap gate. They dedicated it and they said it stores in place. So it starts with a dedication from the priest purification, if you will, and it concludes with the same thing. And this purification is universal. It's for everybody. It's for the gates. It's for the walls, the blessing of God upon it, ritual purification. And then it goes on, but we get a pivot here in terms of the narrative perspective, Nehemiah 1231. I had the leaders of Judah go up to the top of the wall. Okay. So now Nehemiah is the projecting character again here. And this is where we figure out he's the guy who's the master of ceremonies. He's the guy who planned this whole thing. And every one of the dance steps, every one of the little things we're going to see. In the ensuing however many verses here until the end of chapter 12, that's all from the mind of Nehemiah, who you will recall is a dude steeped in the history of the Old Testament, the history of the descendants of Abraham. He knows this story. He lives this story. He understands where he fits and what role he plays in this story. So as soon as you turn to verse 31, it says, I, and you know, we're talking about Nehemiah, she get pretty excited because whatever is going to happen next is not going to be amateur hour. This is going to be very thoughtful, very well put together. And it's going to have tons of layers of meaning. I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of the wall to the right toward the dungate. Hoshiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them along with Azariah, Ezra, Mesulam, Judah, Benjamin, Shamiah, Jeremiah, as well as some of the priests with trumpets and also Zechariah, son of Jonathan, the son of Shamiah, the son of Matania, the son of Makiah, the son of Zacher, the son of Asaph. Okay, that name pops once again. Anytime you see that guy's name or the names of his descendants, that's a psalmist. And along with Asaph, his associates, we get a quick list of names here as well. Shamiah, Azarell, Millyai, Gillyai, Mayai, Nathan Al Judah and Hennani with the musical instruments prescribed by David, the man of God. I have to hit pause here somewhere to break all of this stuff down because I think it's getting really exciting. I can see what's happening here. But for the sake of time, I'm only going to tell you one thing today that I see that's happening here that is interesting. And then we're going to get into the deep water stuff that I think Nehemiah is trying to communicate with this ceremony that he set up tomorrow. The one thing that I think is really obvious is by having all the people parade around to top the walls, you're creating a cool amphitheater effect for everybody who's inside the walls participating. That's pretty obvious. And you can picture that. But also think about what it would be like for the people outside the walls to see this whole event going on. I mean, there's a lot of power being projected. There's wealth being expended, but also they're all down there below the walls. And maybe they haven't really seen the walls fully populated yet up there at the top. And they got to be thinking to themselves. It would be really hard for us to shoot things way up there at them because of how gravity is. And it would be really easy for them to shoot things down here toward us because of also how gravity is. This is, I know, just music and it's just a ceremony, but it's also a military flex. It has an element of military review or a military parade, a projection of power, even if it is a very ceremonial and dressed up projection of power. That's interesting to me. But what's really interesting are the nods to other things in the Old Testament that I think Nehemiah is trying to draw out here. Tomorrow we're going to talk about that. And we're going to try to envision what it would have been like to be at this event on this day. I think we're going to have a lot of fun with it. All right, that's plenty for now. I'm Matt.
