    "text": " Welcome to the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Zechariah. There's almost 30 people in the Old Testament named Zechariah, and the name means God remembers or Yahweh remembers. And so when you think about that, it makes perfect sense that there'd be so many people who would have that name because the memory of God is such a prominent theme as you read through the Old Testament. God remembers the screwed up stuff that the nations do, and it might seem like there's no justice for that, but God remembers, and he's going to straighten up accounts with them. He's going to bring justice and judgment on those perpetrators of evil. But also he remembers the lowly and the oppressed, and the people who've been through so much, and he remembers his own people and is covenant with his own people again, even when it seems like it's been a while, and maybe he's forgotten. No, that's not the case. God remembers. And so it makes perfect sense to me that in this Old Testament prophetic book of Zechariah, we would have a guy whose name means God remembers because he's talking to a bunch of people who aren't sure whether or not God remembers. This Zechariah the prophet is working between 520 and 518 BC, and he is a part of this group of exiled Jews and Persia who'd been taken there by the Babylonians who were released by Cyrus the Great to go back and rebuild the temple. But then they run into some opposition, some pretty serious bureaucratic hang-ups, and the work grinds to a halt, and we learn from Zechariah 4-10, the people get into the state of malaise, and they start worrying about building their own houses. And just in general, come to think that this is not a significant time, meaningful things just aren't happening right now. That is the situation into which Haggai and Zechariah are speaking. Here's roughly the timeline of how all this goes down. In August of 520, just shortly after Darius, the king of the Persians, has reiterated Cyrus's decree that the temple should be rebuilt and funded everything, nothing is happening. And so Haggai comes along and is like, hey, you guys got to quit building your own personal, fancy, paneled houses. That is not only an act of selfishness, it's an act of discouragement and malaise. You're acting like the Lord has forgotten. He has not forgotten. Big-time paraphrase is mine. So over the course of the next month into September, we see Zerubable take heed of that and momentum begins again for building. Then around what would be Halloween-ish. I don't think they actually celebrated that back then, but it gives you context. Zechariah comes along and issues a big general purpose call to repentance. Don't do evil like your forefathers did. Turn away from your wicked ways. Surely he has their flirting with unfaithfulness and their commissioning to finish the temple. In view. And somewhere around December of that year, maybe just a little later, it looks like everybody does repent. They respond to Haggai's message. They respond to Zechariah's message. There is building occurring. And now we're into hopeful mode. Well, that fall prophecy from Zechariah in 520 is one of these traditions. Like the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah and then he said this stuff. But the next chunk of prophecies we see in this book are really different in character and that they are all born out of a dream. Dreams are weird and as a result, these look weird, but God uses dreams all throughout the Bible. Way, way, way back in the super old stuff. He uses it in the New Testament as well. Joseph and with Paul later on, this is normative for God. It's a way that he communicates truth even though the imagery is sometimes pretty strange and foreign looking as we encounter it now. There's probably an upside to that in that sometimes the reason that we get bogged down and can't move forward as humans or as a group of humans is because we lack imagination and we can't even picture or envision anything different than what we've quagmired into. And something as weird looking as these dream sequences we see around the Bible can be the kind of thing that really awaken that imagination and shake you into the pursuit of a new paradigm that's better and more in keeping with what God is about. Make the dream thing whatever you will, but the Bible holds it out as being from God and being very instructive in this message of hope and this reminder that God does indeed remember. Here's a quick sampling of some of the vivid imagery from these dream prophecies of Zechariah. First of all, there are writers, well, there are two sequences that have writers from God charioteers going out and patrolling the whole land and they come back and report. It looks like there's actually kind of peace around the world right now and this begs the question like, okay, well, is this the time then that the full realization of the kingdom is to happen and everything is going to get squared away. That question does not get answered. Then there's another vision with this common Old Testament image of horns like brass instrument but like a horn on an animal is a symbol of power or authority and some of the horns represent defeated nations like Babylon or Syria before them and it looks like Persia are the horns of power that are representative of how those evil empires are getting displaced. Then we get imagery that is kind of reminiscent of Amos in terms of that plum line image that you're measuring to make sure things are square. In this case, we get a picture of Zerubable holding that plum line to consider whether things are all square and right and ready to go, maybe coming back with the same kind of hey, everything's looking better kind of verdict like the horseman did in the earlier vision but also there's somebody who's stretching out a measuring cable more like horizontally to go and measure the circumference, the sheer size of what this city of Jerusalem is going to be and then there's a declaration that God is going to be the walls and defend this city and that imagery points forward to a future day in Jerusalem as well. Then we see the high priest Joshua and he's all covered in dirty, gross, grimy clothes representative of the failure and the sins of the people but then this voice appears and is like, no, dress him up in the fine garments and he gets this new outfit that's shining and beautiful and I think in a way, Jesus parable of the prodigal son toward the end of it in Luke 15 is alluding back to this when the dad gets his dirt, pig, slime, covered kid back and is like, whoa, get all of this yuck off of him. My son was dead and now he's alive again, put this fancy outfit on and we're going to celebrate. It's kind of that same vibe here and it's very much in keeping with that theme. God remembers. He remembers in his mercy. He remembers in his justice. Then we get some imagery that kind of looks like the lamp stands at the beginning of the book of Revelation and the idea here is that this kingdom may be realized soon if the people respond to God's calling in the right way. After that, we get a vision that's kind of reminiscent of when Ezekiel bizarrely ate that scroll at the beginning of his book. We see this big flying scroll that appears and is representative of rightness and justice and how things ought to be. Then we get a very strange image of a couple of how we think of angels, but they're described as women with stork wings carrying another lady who gets shoved in a basket and that lady represents wickedness, maybe the wickedness of the nations and it's taken away from Jerusalem and taken off toward Babylon, whatever is going to relocate that over there. Then we get a concluding image that is again of these writers going out and about and being like, no, in light of all these visions. We've seen it really does look like things are maybe trending toward hope and trending in the right direction. Then we get one more bonus vision of the high priest being crowned with some sort of heavenly crown, not because he's this unique special character, but because he's some sort of foreshadowing of what could be with the king of kings, the promised king who is still to come. Now, at this point, it feels like we're just done with the book. It's uniform. The theme of God remembers is all over the place and it's optimistic. I get it. I have a sense of knowing what we need to do. There's a proper amount of open-endedness, but then the book pivots to this whole second part that really does read very differently, not like necessarily somebody different wrote it differently, but it's a very different kind of prophecy. Well, that makes sense. Given what we've seen in the first part, we saw a tradition. All the word of the Lord came to him prophecy. Then we saw these night vision prophecies. Well, now we're going to get more of that oracle poetic style prophecy that we've become so accustomed to throughout the Old Testament prophets. And here we get language about God's people truly readying themselves for the advent of the kingdom and God accomplishing all the things that he's been promising for so long. Then we get sort of an oracle against the nations that looks like it's a description of maybe Alexander the Great, who would be the guy who topples Persia 100, 200 years. And then after that in the middle of chapter nine, we start getting into the really thick Messiah language. I'm going to read you a little bit of it. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, daughter of Jerusalem. See your king comes to you righteous and having salvation gentle and riding on a donkey on a cult, the full of a donkey. Remember, this is coming right after the description of Alexander the Great. And when he cruised into cities during his great grand march of conquest in the 330s BC, he did not do so on a humble donkey. He came in on a massive war horse. So this is meant to be a point of contrast. And I think it's a very big deal. I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the war horses from Jerusalem and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth. Again, they're getting that language that we saw that was common between Micah and Isaiah about beating swords and to plow shares and the end of war. And so everything is looking great as we get into the last few chapters of Zechariah. But then in chapter 11, this shepherd king, this one who rides in on a donkey who's promised who's going to straighten things out, gets rejected by false shepherds, gets rejected by the leaders of the people. And of course, this is all anticipatory of how Jesus' life and public ministry and ultimate death on the cross all goes down. And indeed, that's probably why Zechariah gets referenced so very much, especially in the third act of the book of Matthew that describes how this unfolded in Jesus' life. Finally, in chapter 14, in spite of this anticipated resistance from these false, lesser shepherd leaders of the people, another one of these days of the Lord kind of things happens in Jerusalem, but this one is special. This is the righting of the wrongs. This is the arrival of the kingdom, the big thing that has been hinted at for so long now as being painted in vivid colors for people to see. And with all of this happening against the backdrop of the rebuilding of the temple during this time of malaise and disappointment and fear among the people that God had not remembered, we really are seeing that Zechariah is a cohesive book beginning to end, specifically dealing in the circumstances of those people's moment on the stage of the grand redemptive story of history, but then expanding its view out to something that is going to flow out of what those people do right there in 520 BC, that is going to play a role in all of this much bigger, more amazing stuff that's going to bless all the nations once again. And the result is just a beautiful, wonderful book that I have found myself listening to for fun on repeat again and again and again during workouts and while I do chores because this really does fill me with hope and remind me that God remembers. When you visualize Zechariah, picture that shepherd king who is to come. When you think about the theme, reflect on Zechariah's name, God remembers. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, check out chapter 9 verses 9 through 10, all of chapter 10 and all of chapter 14. Achievement unlocked, Zechariah, there we go. Next time around, we've got the last book of the Old Testament Malachi. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon."
