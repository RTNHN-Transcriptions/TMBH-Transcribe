This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we've been working on Matthew chapter 18 verses 15 through 17 this week, which is the material about what to do when somebody sins or sins against you in church. We're in the middle of the community of faith, the community life discourse where Jesus talks about how to do existence in this new church thing that he's inventing. And one of the practical aspects of this is he's telling people, here's what you do when inevitably things go wrong relationally. In the passage, Jesus doesn't seem terribly shocked that this could happen or like this would be a crazy outlier. He seems to indicate that this will happen from time to time. And then he gives these three simple steps for how to work the thing out. You go to somebody alone and you try to work it out, if it doesn't work, you go with somebody else to establish clear testimonies to what exactly went on there. If that doesn't work, you take them before the church. If that doesn't work, you treat them like somebody who isn't really a Christian. That's the rundown. But there's this lingering question I have that still goes with it. And that is, are there ever any exceptions or is this a hard and fast set of rules, no matter how difficult the case? And I certainly have some thoughts on this of my own, but I thought, I know some people who've done this for a lot longer than me and have had to work out the practical machinations of what it is to do this passage in a family of faith in a church setting. And that is my parents. I figured I'd just ask my mom and my dad what they do with this thing and if there are any exceptions to it. So mom, dad, got you there? Yeah, yeah, right here. I love you. You're talking with me about a thing without any notice whatsoever. All right, I'm worried about your cough. My cough is so frustrating. I'm just trying to be a person, record a thing, but I just keep coughing. Hopefully it'll be done soon. I'm trying. Do you think there's any exception to the Matthew 18 thing or are those three steps in exactly that order, in exactly those ways? Is that all there is to the conversation? Okay, the short answer. No. Okay. Even in the New Testament, one of the things you discover is that the New Testament is not primarily a book of rules that says, do this, do that. Here are the commands, follow it this way exactly, or you are outside the will of God. I do think that those general principles are given for churches to have some flexibility on making those decisions. I think this is an area where at times you may need to temper that directive in order to make it work. One of the things is if you're dealing with a person who is hostile but also dishonest, if you're a pastor or whoever you are, you need to protect yourself from opening yourself to distortion, to lies, to slander, that can take place. So if your meeting place is public, you have some protections. It may be one on one but in a public setting. If you are in an office or a quiet place, maybe there's a spouse or friend or relative, a brother in the next room who can vouch for the conversation that took place. Or at least parts of the conversation. Maybe if they don't hear every word, they can at least get the big picture, the tone of it. Right. So then if I'm hearing you right, you are saying that, all right, step one, where is it just between the two of you? That's the phrase in the NIB that we're going off of. Brother sins against you. Go and show him his fault just between the two of you. So that doesn't necessarily mean alone and in private is how we turn the phrase a lot of how you hear it. But you're saying that doesn't necessarily mean like find a private locked soundproof space. And maybe with a certain type of situation, it makes more sense to go and grab a coffee or something where there are other people around. And maybe the presence of other people will mitigate bad behavior and make the conversation more productive. Is that, am I tracking? Yeah, I think so. But that principle of protection is important because someone who slanders you can destroy your credibility and you have no way of defending yourself. Now, one of the other things that we see in that passage, and I think one purpose of it is also to try to deal with that issue early on. Yeah, it would look like one of the principles here is that Jesus is setting it up so that the thing won't balloon and go nuclear in the early game. There's at least some off ramps to use that language to get you chances to make the thing better before a whole bunch of people become involved and emotions get flared up and people hear half versions of things and formulate opinions or. Yeah, and I think, you know, one of the things that you see there, there's this protection of the unity of the church in Matthew 18. But Matthew is addressing or seems to is how do we get there? And here are some practical ways to get to that point to where we have protected the unity of the church. But the goal of this passage then seems to be reconciliation and restoration. Let's get the thing figured out. It very much opens with if your brother or brothers or sisters sins. So we are talking about people who have an agreement on who God is and what religion they're practicing and that they're both a part of this community and what identify publicly as a part of this community. And so there is a very clear boundary marker right at the beginning to say who we're talking about here. If there was a neighborhood violent crime lord who sinned against you by shooting somebody you loved, I don't think the text is saying you need to go to the crime bosses house alone and in private and be like, Hey, I want to talk about how you gang land murdered someone I loved. I think the recourse there would be like the police, right? Yeah. So this is meant to be within the church within a redeemed community that needs to tweak a few things to make things right. What if that hypothetical crime lord goes to your church? Oh, you're throwing out funny stuff here. I'm trying to probe the boundary. You're not sending somebody from your church to the crime lords house who you just unmasked as being pure. I think maybe you've got an exception there. I think maybe I do. But I think exception is what I'm probing for. What do you think, mom? I think that you also have to be careful if you're the male, female combination. I think you definitely then would need to meet in a public space. You know, a restaurant over coffee or something along that line as a protection. I also think that we have a Holy Spirit that dwells within it. And I think restoration is the whole point. So you need to make sure that you go in trade up and in a loving, kind, restorative manner not confrontational. I think that is the whole point is to make this first step work. Not say, okay, I'm going to get through this first step. So I can go to the second step. Let's fix this one on one. The purpose is always restorative rather than punitive. Unless something happened that it requires punitive action on the part of the larger community, in which case, I think you just got to let that play out, right? Somebody murders somebody or commit some grievous violation. Society is going to be working that out. Opportunities might come for you to try to square accounts or forgive or make it right with that person, which would be incredible, but there's real world stuff that's going to unfold there too. Yeah. But I think even at the third level of church discipline, when it says, bring them before the church, even then, it's like, look at all these people who are telling you that this behavior is wrong and you won't accept it. And even then there's the option of them to turn from that sin in front of all of the congregation and say, yeah, I was wrong. You're all saying I'm wrong. So even there at the third level, it is there's still a restorative element to that. It's not like now we're going to gang up on this guy and let him have it. Yeah, it's not if you tick all three boxes. Now you can do whatever you want to somebody. Right. And I think what in 47 years of ministry, I think I can remember one or two at the most times when it had to go to step two. Wow. That's maybe one that it went to step three. More often than not, if you handle step one lovingly, it can stop right there. And if not, then again, lovingly done with two or more others, it can also stop there. That's very helpful. And that's more experience than I can draw on at literally anything in all of my life. So I'm glad I called because you know things I don't know and you've seen things I don't know. And if I'm hearing you right, and I think I really agree with your assessment, the most basic level of understanding this passage is that the goal here is to resolve the situation. Restoration repentance, everybody gets along. Everything is cool. It's dealt with and it's better being a little bit shrewd about how you handle it so that through some sort of naivete, you don't accidentally make the situation worse and take it in the opposite direction of what all of these steps are designed to accomplish. And then the third thing that I'm hearing is that you can at least hypothetically imagine a situation where it's just dangerous. It's volatile. And you really, it's not time yet to send somebody back into that thing to go alone and in private into a situation that is hurtful and it would be an injustice to even send them back in there because things are still boiling and dangerous. And at that point, your impetus from earlier in Matthew chapter 18 to show care for these little children, people who are in vulnerable situations, etc., that impulse toward justice in the kingdom takes over. And you make sure that you're not giving someone who does horrible, awful, abusive things, another chance to be horrible and awful and abusive. You're putting some guardrails on that to protect the victim from being re-victimized by unshrudely trying to do step one in a very dangerous situation. Is that fair? Yeah, I think you're keeping your eye on the goal of restoration and protecting the unity. And that's the ultimate goal, but there is an element of justice at the end of that process. It's sort of like the grace of God that we receive throughout our life. And yet God is not only the God of love and grace, but he's the God of justice. And I think in a way, the whole process of church discipline or whatever you want to call it reflects that nature of God, of abundant mercy, of forgiveness, of restoration, of every opportunity for that to take place. But even then, man may reject all of those offers of grace and mercy and repentance. Yeah, and then, very simply, the end of the process says that if somebody ultimately rejects all of that stuff, you treat them like you would somebody who needs the gospel, somebody who's outside and is in need of understanding who God is and what the kingdom is about. And you're effectively starting over in that regard. But just as we're called to love the unbeliever, that doesn't give us the right to not love those people who have been set aside in the film that they're not a believer then still need to be kind and loving. That's a lot to unpack. And thank you briefly here for helping me game it out. You're very welcome. Hope you get better soon. I love you both very much. Thank you so much. Okay. Bye bye. Bye. Thanks for hanging out with me, everybody. And thanks for letting me bring my parents on. I love them. And I think they're great. And I think they have good ideas. And I think they contributed a lot to our conversation. We will pick it up with the next chunk of Matthew 18 next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute five hour podcast.
