And I think today would be a good day to start with a content warning, because we're going to be talking about the parameters, the rules that are being put in place for this beauty contest that is happening in Esther chapter two, or at least beauty contest is usually how it is portrayed in recent Christian literature and recent Christian art. But I'm thinking about what we know about King Xerxes and the proclivities he has and what Persia was like and what goes along with being the absolutely most powerful human on all of earth. And I guess I have some questions about those portrayals of this being an incredibly chased, dignified beauty pageant. And I'm going to explore some of those questions. And that may result in conversations you don't want to have with the youngsters just yet. So I'm going to defer to your parental wisdom on that or help you in exercising that parental wisdom by giving you this content warning on the front end. You have been advised. Here's the thing, man, I'm looking at how Xerxes is. I'm looking at what kind of stuff he wants from women and how he views the women in his life, both from Esther and from Herodotus. I'm looking at the way his dad treated women and thought about women and wives. I'm looking at the way his advisors think about women and wives. I'm looking at the way his personal attendance in verse two of chapter two are seeing that the king is sad and they're like, we should just bulk up his harem or have a contest to get him somebody attractive to be around. And I'm adding all of that up and I'm just thinking this contest probably had a physical element to it, right? I mean, come on. I understand that if that is the case that doesn't reflect as positively on young queen Esther, who I do not want to besmirch, her flaws do not threaten me. I'm not troubled by it. I'm going to be judgment for whatever her flaws are as this story unfolds. But do you really mean to tell me that the great king of kings who can have whatever he wants, whenever he wants it, is going to have a contest whereby he brings everybody in and has them read poetry or answer questions about world peace or even have them engage in a contest where they wear a relatively modest one piece bathing suit? I just don't think that's what's going to happen. He has a whole harem. We know what a harem is, right? I mean, it uses that word right here in the Bible. I'm not just making that up. He has a whole collection, much like the also compromised king Solomon of women who are there to do nothing but bring him physical pleasure. And he has a lot of them so that should he become bored in any of them or should he like them for different talents or features he can rotate between them. Again, King Solomon had the exact same setup. Listen to the language that's on display here. And let's think about what it is that Esther is about to get signed up for. And I think as we do so, we won't like Esther less. I think we'll appreciate what she's being subjected to and what she's going through here that much more. Okay, once again, Esther to one later when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided. He remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her. So he's very much in this place of she did this, but I did that. I guess there's probably enough blame to go around than I did stupid stuff. Things were so much simpler back then with Vashti, but I can't go back with the king's attendance. They're seeing all of this, right? So it goes on. Then the king's personal attendance proposed and they feel bad for the guy. I mean, they know everything about his rhythms and what they perceive his needs to be in order for him to be a great king. I mean, that's their job is to make sure all of his needs are met. You can't rule everything. You can't be the land of earth and water and the king of kings and of lands appointed by a Hurah Mazda. If you're moping around like this. And so they say, let us search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king to be clear. Seeing multiple young virgins for the king, let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful girls into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Okay, the word here is harem. Herum is a collection of women who follow around a powerful man, usually a king of some sort to provide physical pleasure for him in a variety of ways. Not all of those ways necessarily would be sexual, but a whole lot of them would be. And then these attendants go on, let them be placed under the care of the king's eunuch who's in charge of the women and let beauty treatments be given to them. So the idea here is that we're going to go find these diamonds in the rough. We're going to search far and wide. The most extreme ends of the kingdom is kind of a California girls situation here. We're going to find the northern girls who are good at this and the East Coast girls good at this. We're going to find the southern girls and we're also going to find those West Coast those California girls, but we understand they're going to be a little bit rubbish. Oh, great king. You're not going to want a bunch of country girls coming in. So first we're going to bring them in. They're going to get a lot of training about how to make you feel things you want to feel. We're going to dress them up the right way. We're going to make them smell just the right way. We're going to teach them all of the arts of pleasing a king. And then after we've done that, then picking it up in verse four, let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. Look, you and I can get along just fine. If you have been with me and you've looked at all the evidence about who the achaemenid kings were, what Persia was, what the expectation culturally of kings of any land would be at this point. And if after looking at the character of Xerxes and the things he's done and the chaos surrounding him and his proclivities, if you look at that and honestly, honestly, you're like, no, I really, I really do think it was some sort of pageant. And I really do think it was above board. And I really do think it was classy. You know what? We can just agree to disagree on that. And I don't think anything less of you and I don't hold your view and contempt. It kind of sounds like I did the way I framed that all up. I shouldn't have said it exactly that way. But no, really, if that makes more sense and that is your read on the text, cool. It is not my read on the text. And I just need to be honest about that and turn over all of my cards all the time because the deal we're making with how we do this podcast is that I'm just trying to give you a straight read on what I'm seeing in the text and what reason and history and logic and narrative analysis tells us about what we're seeing here. And my most honest read is that what is being put together here is a contest that involves providing some sort of sexual pleasure for the king. I cannot imagine a reality where Xerxes, the great king of kings, is going to name someone his wife without knowing exactly what they're like in an intimate setting. And I say again, that to me does not besmirch the character or ruin who Esther is. She like all people should be judged at least to some extent as a product of her moment. She's in an impossible situation. She isn't at the beginning of this story in control of her own fate. But as things unfold, we will find that she takes this exploitative situation, one where she is out of control and flips it to one where she does have a degree of power. And then what does she use that power for the benefit of other people? I think the story of Esther and the character development of Esther hits that much harder if we read the attendance proposal for what this contest would be as what it almost certainly must have been. Okay, you can unplug the kids years now. Thanks for hanging out with me, everybody. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
