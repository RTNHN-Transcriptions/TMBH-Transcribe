See the way that's kind of passive, passively nice. Like I'm doing you a favor by getting off the call and I called it. I did it first. You can just feel the rhythm. Of that social engagement, it just says, oh, it's time to be done here. And then other times we do this thing, I've noticed this for many, many years. Now I'm starting to see that it's being noticed around the internet as well, but it's the thing where you've been talking with people for a while, but it's time to go. And so while you're sitting, you pat your hip pockets like this and that pat is like feeling for your keys or your wallet or whatever. Let's make sure I got everything here is what that's meant to communicate. And then you say the following word. You ready for it? Well, and that means it's time to go. And there's usually like a little key jingle in there or something like that. And those are just Pavlovian social signals to be like, oh, wow, it just feels like it's it's time to be done here. And movies storytelling, same thing, right? There's certain beats, certain rhythms. We're like, oh, and now we're done, which is kind of disorienting in the Lord of the Rings novels because you're like, oh, evil is defeated. I think we're good to go. And then you get the whole scourging of the Shire bit, which the movie's kind of skipped it does feel like you get an act for almost to those stories. But other times you get that sense the story's over. Everything's resolved for now. We're good. And usually your intuition is right. Think about the throne room metal award scene at the end of the first Star Wars movie from the 1970s or whatever it was. I mean, you got the triumphant music and all the heroes are paraded in there and they get medals and everybody's happy and the all the things that cameras do and everything. It just tells you you're done here. It'd be weird if then there were another 20 minutes of movie, I suppose. And surely you've all seen something where you feel like it's over and then it's not over. But usually your intuition is going to be right on this. Well, likewise here in Esther chapter eight, we are getting all the signals that say the story is over. Hey, man, the bad guy got cathartically shamed in front of everybody. We got to enjoy it. We got a front row seat to it. His family is shamed. The gallows that he built for Mordecai, the good guy, they ended up getting used on him and all of his stuff, his possessions and his role in society. All of that has been transferred to Esther and Mordecai. Now, Esther is rich, not just with the king's riches, but she now has her own estate. Remember, it's pretty big estate. I mean, he had a quarter of a billion dollars that he was willing to offer for a single transaction just for petty revenge earlier in the book of Esther. So I mean, she's a billionaire, man. She's not kind of rich. She is among the richest people in the kingdom. Maybe she's the richest woman ever in history at this point. It was pretty crazy, right? So it just feels like that's your throne room scene and the music plays and everybody gets their medal and maybe Xerxes and Esther and Mordecai and the final shot. One of them says a joke and then they all laugh really, really hard at the joke is a pop song plays in the background and then they all leap into the air and high five. Then it frees frames right there while they're in the air as their high five makes contact and that's like the first beat. It's like a whip beat to get us into the pop song that's going to play as the credits scroll from bottom to top over the freeze frame. Whoops. Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da. It's the Esther defeated, the bad guys always fight for hope and never give up on your dreams. Because that's what the story is about. Da da da da da da da. Always fight for what's right and be brave. It's be a song. It'd be something like that. Can you picture this ending? Because that's what it feels like is supposed to be happening here. But it's not what we get. There's so many more pages of things because apparently killing Heyman didn't just automatically kill his plan. Wait, what? I thought we were in the clear. Okay. The verse three, they do the high five and the credits are rolling, but then the high five comes apart. The freeze frame stops. The credit stop rolling. The pop song goes away and it says Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Aggagite, which he had devised against the Jews. Huh? Well, I would think that gigantic 75 foot long stick that's run through his abdomen that he's gradually sliding down while the birds pick what's left of him apart up in the air for everybody to see would also kind of mean the end of all of his policy decisions. But apparently that is not how things work. Why? Well, remember the stuff that we looked at in Herodotus? And remember the stuff that we saw, particularly in the book of Ezra, the demonstrated darriases that Xerxes dad, his enthusiasm to make sure that any edict from a previous achaemenid king, any edict that came from the throne was never questioned or countermanded. You remember all of that stuff? Remember how Cyrus the Great, the founder of the empire who won by right of conquest inarguably for everybody to see? Remember how that dude had all this goodwill banked and everybody was loyal to him, but then he died and then there is a succession crisis after that. Remember how his son's land sparrow darius came to power and remember how he had to go out in front of everybody and try to make this case for how he is the rightful descendants somehow is like the ninth nephew five times removed of Cyrus. I'm the logical choice. I'm the right one to solve this succession crisis and deal with the liars who were trying to usurp the throne. I'm not the usurper. I'm the un usurper. He had to say all of this stuff. He had to do all this ridiculous political kabook theater in front of everybody. He had to carve a bunch of stuff on a big rock wall to tell everybody that this is the real thing. There's a billboard that's never going to go away that says I'm real and everybody else was a liar. And effectively that I am the continuation of what Cyrus started. I am the continuation of the achaemenid empire. Well, part of what he said in those instructions indicated that you should not go back on any of this legacy and a warning to future Kings is there heed this warning. He says, don't mess with this billboard. Don't mess with the narrative. You're in charge because of this narrative and do not put distance between you. And previous edicts treat the throne, he says implicitly as somehow infallible and edicts that are issued from this throne as being somehow the will of a Huramazda, a will that does not change and that we as his Kings and his servants as a kiminids, we don't miss when we issue edicts from the throne. Remember when the work ground to a halt in Jerusalem, the work that had been authorized by Cyrus, Darius did not feel obligated at all to continue that work until he said, all right, well, let's search and make sure we're not violating a previous edict of the throne and discovered. Nope, that wasn't edict of the throne. Then all of a sudden he's willing to throw money at it and willing to throw violence at it, threatening to give anybody who inhibited the progress of the Jews on rebuilding their temple, the old Haman treatment. That's anachronistic deal. Haman treatment hadn't happened yet, but you see what I'm driving at. Darius clearly imparted these values to Xerxes. And at this point, where we're at in Esther chapter eight, we are 50, 50 ish years in to this style of rule from the achaemen and emperors of Persia. And we're 50 years in to people being told again and again that edicts from the throne are edicts from a Huramazda, the great God of Persia himself. I'm sorry, they're irrevocable. We only issue judgments that are correct around here and to rescind such a judgment would be to effectively acknowledge that we aren't ruling on behalf of a Huramazda. When you understand that, you understand this equation because to you and me who are descended from the Roman legal system where stuff changed all the time, this wrote new laws constantly. The last law on the last table of the 12 tables of the Roman Republic said that whatever the people have last ordained, this shall become law. It was baked into their DNA and consequently into our DNA because we're legally descended from Rome here in the West. It's baked into our DNA. If the rules bad or the president, the Congress has issued a bad law, you just unmake the law. How hard is it? So it's head scratching that you couldn't just do that here. But when you understand the relationship between the Aquimid emperors, a Huramazda, the religious sensibilities of the people and what they had rooted their authority, what they had founded their authority upon, all of a sudden you realize, wait, we do still have a crisis here. Wait, stop playing the pop song. Quit scrolling the credits on freeze frame the high five. That edict is still out there and it is a ticking time bomb because the date is still circled. It's still activated and further, everybody got the notice a long time ago with the signature in the seal of the king upon it that this is going to happen. I mean, what are you going to do? Send a telegraph to everybody and be like, no, never mind. That wasn't real. Even if you could just simply rescind this thing, you've got a new time crunch here in that we're coming up upon that date and the last anybody heard from their king was we're supposed to kill all the Jews. So we are not done with this story. The crisis has not yet been averted. All we've done is deal with the guy who took over the train full of passengers, kicked the engineer out and then cranked the engine to maximum speed, smashed the brake, destroyed the controls and jumped off the train with the parachute over a bridge, sending that whole train full of people careening toward their death. Yeah, he might be out of the picture, but he did what he did before it was over. And now the remaining characters, Esther Mordecai and Xerxes have got to find a way out of this that doesn't involve undermining everything about the Aquaman at empire because Xerxes isn't going to give that up. It's the one sacrifice he cannot make. And they got to figure out how to solve this quickly. More on that next time around. A mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Wait, don't go. No, no, no. I made a terrible mistake. There was something I need to tell you about that throne room scene that we were talking about earlier from Star Wars Episode four. I may have Jeff put a link down below to the Arlnotz video. It's a YouTube channel. And I think this is the first video that catapulted them to prominence. They do sound editing, some video editing. They just make scenes you're used to funnier. They did this thing where they took that throne room scene and they took away John Williams musical score and then they added in a bunch of mouth sounds and just the awkwardness of how weird that must have felt with the whole room empty because there's no orchestra in there. They weren't hearing that music when they were hanging metals on Han Solo and Luke Skywalker and stuff. And so it's really fun to go and imagine what that social discomfort might have been like if there were no orchestra. Jeff will link it. It's funny if you haven't seen it, you're going to like it. Okay. Now that's actually it. I'm at this 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
