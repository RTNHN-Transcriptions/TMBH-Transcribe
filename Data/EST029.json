This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast, and I would like to open today with a ridiculous hypothetical situation that is going to include me, six of my friends, an airplane pilot, and the king of England. It doesn't have to be the current king, it would be any king. It'll probably work better and be less morbid if we go with a different name for the king. This is going to be King Chad, nothing personal to all of you, Chad's who listen. And I got to be careful with which king it is because the king is going to die in this scenario. Okay, so we're all on the plane and the plane crashes. Super bomber, the pilot dies and King Chad dies. King Chad, the first of England, first of his name, breaker of chains, he perishes. But me and my six buddies, we all live as are the rescue crews get there and then the journalists get there and then put a microphone in front of our faces. And I'm there. I got one of those blankets on me. I'm all huddled up and everything. I'm like, well, I was a harrowing ordeal, but I feel like I really got to know the king on that flight. God rest his soul. And it's with great pain that I am forced to relay to the world and to his subjects, his last wishes, which were that I would succeed him as king of England. And it is with a very heavy heart that I take on this difficult burden. And I promise to do my best to uphold his legacy and his memory and how I serve all of you as your king. And then maybe my friends would all yell like long live the king. And then I think people have to yell that afterwards. It's like whoever yells at first, that's just how people maybe become king now. And obviously in this scenario, a lot of people would be like, I don't have some problems with your story, but I guess you called it first. If people went along with that, I would obviously be very beholden and very loyal to the good name of King Chad the first because my claim to the throne depends entirely on his reputation and his vouching for me. And so never in all of my years of policy would I ever rule in a way that was antithetical to the wishes of King Chad the first. I would uphold everything because again, my whole claim to the throne, my whole claim to authority is dependent on my connection with him. Likewise, if you've been listening for the last couple of days, you can totally see where this is going. Darius pulled a stunt kind of like that in the sixth century BC after the great King Cyrus, the great had died and his son, Cambyses briefly ruled. Darius ends up standing there with the crown in his hand and people are like, wait, what? No, how did you end up king? Something about that seems weird. And he comes up with a story that's about as plausible as the one I just gave you yet for whatever reason, because he was quick in his action because he had the right allies vouching for him. It seems like it works long enough for him to go and fight a few battles. So do some enemies who had a problem with it and grab this crown and become king. And then he goes and he puts an inscription on a big old school version of Mount Rushmore that tells the whole story and announces to everyone, this is how the things are going to be. Well, a king like that is obviously going to be highly beholden to the reputation of his predecessor Cyrus the Great. Because what Darius is trying to do is paint a picture of how he is the writing of the song. Some impostors came along, he claimed, and they were trying to deprive all of us Persians of the rightful line of noble kings born of noble superior blood, the great achaemenid dynasty that flows through Cyrus the Great and on again reluctantly and with a heavy heart. To me, your servant, the king, Darius the first, hopefully someday soon to be called the Great. And I suppose every monarch in history has somebody has some circumstances, something to which they feel they owe their crown. And it's probably a good thing if they do oftentimes because it causes them to imagine that there is or at least was an authority greater than themselves. And that's got to help a king rule more justly to some extent. And for Darius, it's, well, I'm an achaemenid. I'm a part of this family. This is the rightful line of kings that will always exist. And the rightness of this line to be king, the fitness of this line to be king is demonstrated in the quality of leadership we got out of Cyrus the Great. So what we see in both biblical sources and extra biblical sources is a Darius who's a very independent thinker, a wildly gifted administrator. I envy this guy. I wish I had his talents for thinking ahead, imagining how things could be. And figuring out how to put them in order and deploy the right people to get things done. He was a phenomenal king in terms of empire building and bureaucracy building and management of people. He, he really is the great. He deserves the title even if the way he came to power in the first place was a little bit questionable. But even though he's all of that stuff in this great administrator, great king, all of that, he also looks like he was always very beholden to the reputation of Cyrus the second. Or forgot that his claim to authority flowed from the good reputation of his distant cousin Cyrus and the family name in general that Cyrus bore and that Darius bore. That is what he could point to or that was written even on that giant rock that he could point to and say, Hey, this is why I should be king. And this is why my descendants Xerxes, art as Xerxes, art as Xerxes, a second, etc. Should be kings as well. And in fact, in that inscription that we talked about yesterday on that big rock that that has done inscription toward the end of it, he spells it out that no one in the future should mess with this inscription. It's like he's telling his kids. Remember, if you become spoiled morons later on, the reason we are kings, wink, wink, read between the lines on this rock is because we have a plausible story also written on this rock that says we are descended from the same family as Cyrus and that we ought to be kings. Therefore, do not mess with this rock. Do not deface it. uphold the things that are said here and always oppose the lie. That being the one that that magician shapeshifter employed to try to take over the throne wrongly. The Darius and his buddies corrected. And let me just read you specifically what the language sounds like on this stone carving that Darius directs toward future kings, future generations. Darius the king says you who shall be king hereafter, the man who shall be a lie follower or who shall be a doer of wrong to them do not be a friend, but punish them well. Darius the king says you who shall thereafter behold this inscription which I have inscribed or these sculptures do not destroy them, but thence onward protect them as long as you shall be in good strength. Darius the king says if you shall behold this inscription or these sculptures and shall not destroy them and shall protect them as long as in you there is strength may a Huramazda be a friend to you and may family be to you in abundance and may you live long and what you shall do that may a Huramazda make successful for you. But Darius the king says if you shall behold this inscription or these sculptures and shall destroy them and shall not protect them as long as to you there is strength may a Huramazda be a smiter of you and may family not be to you and what you shall do that for you may a Huramazda utterly destroy. Sometimes we use the expression oh he painted himself into a corner. This is bigger than that. Darius has sculpted himself into a corner in that effectively now anyone who wants Darius to do the things that they want Darius to do who is shrewd and clever and can read the situation they can just go to Darius and be like well you are wise and shrewd in all your ways and a great king and so surely you would want to uphold the instructions laid out by your predecessor Cyrus the great you know Cyrus whose blood you share and whose kingship and authority your claim depends upon that Cyrus the great right and we get sources internal to the Bible and external to the Bible that looks like that was Darius's trigger phrase his key phrase the key to his heart was to invoke his connection to this achaemenid family and indeed my friends that is exactly what we see happening in the book of Ezra in chapter four and in chapter five I'm going to be a little bit of this now and then we're going to round the rest of it out tomorrow during the reign of Cyrus the great about two or three years into the rebuilding project of the temple under the leadership of Zerubable the descendant of David the enemies of the Jews show up and they find a way to use bureaucratic tricks to grind things to a halt and in the interim between the last few years of Cyrus's reign and the first few years of Darius's reign Persia transforms Persia's not sitting around worrying about what's going on in Jerusalem very much they are putting an organizational structure over the top of this empire that is unparalleled in human history to this point they're dividing the whole thing up into all of these provinces or satrapis and they've got all of these regional rulers who are reporting back they've got a pony express system that they built a not joking here that can cover the whole empire in just a matter of days with fresh horses and messages and there's this whole almost cardiovascular system built around the heartland of the Persian empire with data and information and tribute and resources coming from all ends of the kingdom and the king is at this master control panel working all of it well you can understand of some of the Jerusalem squabbles might a little bit slip through the cracks or more pressing needs and so between the time of Cyrus and the time of Darius probably a few different leaders and governors and bureaucrats who oversee supplies and things like that come and go out in Jerusalem maybe some of them were sympathetic maybe some of them weren't maybe there please went unanswered but now Darius is a little bit into his reign here in chapter five of Ezra we know that he had to fight hard to establish that it wasn't just that he rode hard and killed the mage who was impersonating Bardiia or probably Bardiia as it was and then just announced himself to be king now you had to fight for another year to secure his kingdom secure his empire and start building out this elaborate system set of systems that I was just telling you about it's in that second year of the reign of king Darius which would be about 521 BC that things have settled down enough he's defeated his enemies he's quelled the people who opposes claim to the throne it's at about that time that the situation in Jerusalem finally makes its way back to the desk of the king of Persia it's not Cyrus anymore now it's Darius and in fact it says so right here at the end of Ezra chapter four thus the work on the house of god in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia and what we're going to see in chapter five is how that long shadow cast by Cyrus and his legacy applies pressure to Darius to act in accordance with the will of his predecessor to get things back on track for the rebuilding process in Jerusalem we'll look closely at that text tomorrow and continue to have fun with it last thing not quite sure how to say it but thank you to mystery person who keeps sending me one individual little silver coin every so often wrapped up in an unmarked envelope i have no idea who you are but you must have remembered that i like coins and i like how different coins minted at different times connect us to recent history and distant history and it was a really nice thing to do and i don't expect anything like that from anybody ever at all ever but i just wanted you know that's all it and that was really nice of you and thank you and also thank you to all of you for being here which is the thing that i desire the most it means so much to me that we have conversations about this and that they can have the tone that they have and that you are game for that so thank you to everybody and also thank you to mystery coin person that means a lot appreciate y'all i'm matt this is the 10 minute five-hour podcast let's do this again soon
