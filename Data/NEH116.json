It's fast, fun, free, daily deep-dye Bible. And right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy-to-use format at thetmbh.com. All right, look, every single one of us has been on the giving side and the receiving side of a deeply broken, deeply painful relationship. This happens. It's part of the barnacles that stick to the whole of our soul and our lives as we age. We have relational fallout. We have pain. Even wonderful people, far better, more moral, more enlightened, more intelligent people than me. Even you all who are just great at everything and emotionally mature. Even you have relationships that break over the course of your life. It happens to all of us. And it hurts. These are the things that we apparently regret on our deathbed. I've never been on my deathbeds. I don't know for sure, but I think probably I'll be sad about relationships that I couldn't fix. And I bet that if you think back on the really hurtful, really broken relationships, you could pick one right now. Go ahead and do it. Picture it. Got it? I bet that there is one thing that you wish that person would come and say to you. And if they said it, then you would have reconciliation. You would agree on what the whole backstory is. The things you've fought about and disagreed about the lies. All of that would wash away with that one thing. If Kelly would just come to you and be like, what you said I did, I lied about it for years, but you were right all along. I did that thing. And the reason you said that you thought I did it, you were right all along. I did it for exactly the reason that you said you thought I did it. And I was wrong and I regret it and it's consuming my soul. And I need nothing from you other than forgiveness because you said the things that were true the entire time. I'm so, so, so sorry. Will you forgive me? I bet there are some of you who if metaphorical Kelly came to you right now and said basically that those would be the words that would fix the thing. Maybe you've forgiven. Maybe you've forgotten. Maybe you've done your best to move on. Maybe both parties have and you just sort of left it at an unsettled impasse. You know, I'm not going to try to hurt you. You don't try to hurt me and we'll just kind of, you know, move on without trust. Maybe we'll never see each other again. Whatever. That's not the ideal though. What you want, what your heart yearns for in those truly broken relationships is reconciliation. That's different than forgiveness. That's more than forgiveness. That is being made whole and made right with each other and it's elusive and it's a difficult. And when you achieve it, those relationships often thrive in ways that no other relationship ever does in a lifetime when you achieve it because reconciliation, it covers over a whole stack of ugly stuff from the past. It's like there was a time when checkbooks were a thing and I had one for a little while when I was a kid and they were still popular. It's like 16. I got my first checkbook. I got like 80 bucks in there and I'd write a check for $2.97 to Burger King or something three or four times a month. Then at the end of the month, I would get mailed a statement of all the checks I wrote, all five of them. And I'd have to look in my book to see if everything I said happened was the same as what the bank said happened. And if there were any discrepancies, I had to talk with the bank to work things out with them and make sure we were on the same page as to what the truth of the matter was. That's reconciliation. Well, the reason that reconciliation is hard is because it requires a swallowing of pride oftentimes. It requires us to admit things we don't want to admit to because generally, if there's been a relational falling out, most of the time we have ownership of that at some level. And most of the time the falling out happened over things that are really damaged about our character or they happen over a lapse in our integrity. And we can't live with ourselves if that story that makes us look awful is true. We just can't square that with our own sense of nobility and our own sense of self. So we'll run from the other person and we'll run from the truth and we'll be dishonest about that all the way to our grave. We'll lie about stuff that happened in childhood that is relatively consequence free just to save face, doubling down and redoubling down on a lie that could have just passed into history decades ago, simply out of pride and insecurity. Reconciliation, the part where we admit to the truth of what the story was and we agree upon the narrative and the facts of it, that is the finish line that so often in a broken relationship we can see from a distance, but we take an off ramp and never make it there because it's painful to admit it's painful to square up those accounts with someone else so often. We're at that finish line right now in the Old Testament, not just the book of Nehemiah, the entire Old Testament, which is really, if you think about it, a document about a broken relationship where the tension is, will it ever get fixed or not? And what would it take to reconcile something this doubled down upon and broken? What would it take to reconcile a relationship where one party has gotten everything right, something only God could do? And it's God, that's the party. So he got everything right, but the other party is responsible for everything that went wrong. How do you fix it? Well, throughout the Old Testament, we've seen all these moments where we flirt with getting it right, but rarely do we see any kind of political will or group will on the part of the descendants of Abraham to just say the words, to admit the thing that would have to be admitted in order for the relationship to be squared up and the narrative to be reconciled. Remember, I was asking you to think about what those words were with your broken relationship. Well, what would those words be for the descendants of Abraham, the Jewish people, the Hebrews, the Israelites, what would it be after the whole Old Testament? Let's just play that out for a second. Pause even if you want to. If you've been doing the whole Bible thing with me, just pause for a minute and think about it. Let's say you are in the shoes of the Jewish people in recently rewalled Jerusalem in 444 BC. You're having a religious revival and you have the opportunity to declare something together toward God to try to reconcile the relationship, to reconcile the narrative, to come around to admitting that the narrative of God about what's happened here is the true narrative and that your narrative has been false. Maybe pause for a second and just think about that. What would you say if you could quantum leap into the body of the people there and say exactly the right thing in this moment? What would that be? It's okay if you didn't pause. I won't be offended by that at all. I have had a little longer to think about this because I knew I was going to say it into a microphone. Here's what I've come up with. I think if you wanted to say the words that would solve the relationship, it would need to go something like this. Okay, God, not only have I been wrong and have I resisted you for my entire life, but so have all of us. We've resisted you as a people. Our institutions resist you. I resist you subconsciously. I resist you consciously. And worst of all, I dress it up with fancy language and religious platitudes to make it look like I'm doing you a favor while I resist you and undermine you and violate your trust. My entire story, a story that goes back for a couple thousand years is a story of stubbornness and resistance to you. I am no different than the people who came before me. I'm made of the same stuff. I have the same problems as them. And I have tried to spin dishonest, carefully framed and crafted narratives to make me look good and maybe even make you look a little bit bad. Like you might actually be the problem here with your difficult expectations and your standards of holiness. Not only have I failed, but I've tried to project my failure on to you. Not only have I been the bad guy and my family has been the bad guy. I've tried to make you out to be the bad guy and I've tried to peddle that narrative to my neighbors so I could save face in my own insecurity. I have tried to craft a dishonest narrative that I could live with, but my dishonest narrative keeps being exposed as a lie. The only thing that has been true and steady in this whole saga of events that is transpired over the last 2000 years with my people is you, God, you have been steady. You have been consistent. You have acted exactly the way you said you would. You have done all the things that you said you would do. The fact that you are still here, despite our dishonesty, my personal dishonesty speaks to your character. If it were the other way around and you were acting like I've acted and I were perfect and blameless and holy like you, I think given my character, I would have walked away. I wouldn't be so forgiving and long suffering. The bottom line is this God, you were right and we were wrong. You were patient and forgiving and I snubbed that and I didn't appreciate that. I can't blame this on everybody else. I was wrong. You were right and I accept your version of the story, which is the true version of the story and I will not proliferate lies or dishonest versions of the story meant to make me look right and you look bad ever again. The chief pain and hardship in my life has been brought upon me by me. The blessings in my life are from you. And with all of that said, I want to be and I want us to be fully reconciled to you and your truth and your character. And that is what I'm committing myself to now. Yeah, I think it would take something like that. Those are the kind of face down words that are easy for me to say when I'm imagining myself in someone else's situation with someone else's problems, with someone else's failures, with someone else's people group. It's very easy for me to say all that stuff. It's very hard for me to say that stuff about myself in my actual situation and with my own carefully crafted and manicured narratives that always just happened to make me look good and other people look bad. Yeah, it's real hard for me to admit to that stuff. Real easy for me to imagine what ought to be said on the part of the Jewish people right here in Nehemiah chapter nine. But as it turns out, as we look forward, they seem to collectively be in a place where they are ready with no qualifications and no pushback to fully admit to say the words that would need to be said on their part to demonstrate that they get it, to fully admit that God was right and they were wrong, to fully admit that their narrative has been dishonest and skewed, even if quite sophisticated, and that God's version of events is in fact the true version of events and that they want to be reconciled to it. When we pick it back up tomorrow in Nehemiah nine, maybe keep this conversation we just had in the back of your head because I think it's going to be really easy for Nehemiah nine to sort of again, wash over us and be like, Oh, it's just sort of a recitation of a bunch of things we've already seen in the Old Testament. There's repeating the story or whatever. No, what they're doing is saying the hardest words, the truth, what they're doing is giving a recounting of God's rightness and their wrongness blow by blow through the whole thing. Not as though it's somebody else's mistake, but there's to own. What we are about to read together over the next few days is a remarkable demonstration of humility and honesty that shows the truest of heart level desires to get something right that the people on screen here have gotten wrong. It's excellent. And it is something that we should not leave in this ancient text and be like, Oh, look what they did. They said some things they repeated the story. It's the kind of thing that should inspire us and affect how we handle our business when our relationships break and with the relationships that are already broken. So we'll get into all of that next time around. Matt, this is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
