This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and this week my friend Jeff who normally edits the music he's on vacation. I hope he's having a beautiful time. So my other friend Tina who helps me out with the editing now on Ironwood Rhino and she edits all the episodes for no dumb questions that I do with my buddy Destin. She is taking over and she's been helping me out this week. But all of that is particularly pertinent because Tina, she's got a long list of skills. She's grandma. She can make authentic Mexican food. She can speak to languages. She's real smart. She's great at stuff. But one of the things she can't do to the best of my knowledge is mix right in a range and perform music. I don't think she has a music studio and her basement at all, which means there's no chance which means there's no chance of her whipping up some little cover of the song I'm talking about and sticking it at the end of this episode, which I would not want because the song I want to talk about is called Say So by Doja Cat. How do I feel about Doja Cat? I don't know. No opinion. I would need information to have an opinion. I don't really know anything about her. I saw the picture of her one time on an album cover. Looked like a nice lady. I don't know. I'm sure she's great. I have no personal prop. Like I got I got nothing. I got nothing whatsoever. All I know is she has a song called Say So and somebody who's in charge of all the radio stations in the world and whoever owns XM like Dick and Linda XM, the owners of XM, decided we're going to play that song. Not once, not twice, but all the time at any given time, you could tune somewhere on XM radio and it will be playing. And it turned into a running joke for my wife and I a couple of years ago, 2019, 2020. I don't know. Yeah, pandemic year. I don't remember is somewhere right in there and I'm not kidding. We would get in the vehicle and they turn on the XM radio and be like, it's coming. Here it is. And it was just always on always, always, always all the time. Now the song itself, I don't know. It's got kind of old like 70s sort of funk groove. I don't hate it. It's fine. I guess it's not special. It's not good. And I know it is because it's on all the time. And that's really all I wanted to talk about because when I put together these episodes, I'm like, let's do a fun little thing at the beginning. It's kind of memorable. And then we'll talk about how that sort of illustrates the point and then we'll come back to it in case people were forgetting what the exercise was here and be like, Hey, remember the thing we talked about at the beginning? There's a thing we talked about at the beginning. This is wonderful. And then you feel symmetry and it's great and we do it all again tomorrow. So today I'm like, okay. And Jesus keeps using this. If you say so line, I'm going to say so. What do we even connect that to? Oh, no, that song. It's back. I'm going to tell everybody about it. So then now they're going to go look it up and now it's going to be stuck in your heads too. Seriously, please don't go listen to it. It's repetitive. It's going to get stuck in your head. But please do go read the Bible because in the book of Matthew, there is a phrase that is often repeated toward the end of the book that is important because Jesus says it and it is good. And now we are going to look at three places where that phrase gets repeated and we're going to have a nice time doing it. And that my friends is the art of the introduction. That is in arguably the worst one I've ever done yet. Here we go. In Matthew, chapter 26 and 27, all with a span of 70 versus or so, three times we've got Jesus deferring to his enemy with this line. Like, well, if you say so, whatever you say, and I think the turn of the phrase is to be understood the way we might use that turn of a phrase today. Like somebody's like, you're a jerk. Whatever you say. Oh, well, aren't you just the best at baseball? If you say so, I think that's how Jesus is employing it here. It starts with the one we looked at yesterday with the awkward last supper moment between him and Judas is scary it where Jesus says in verse 21, I tell you the truth. One of you will betray me and then everybody's really sad and they start to say to him one after the other. Surely not I, Lord. And then Jesus replied, the one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The son of man will go just as it is written about him, but woe to that man who betrays the son of man. It would be better for him if he had not been born than Judas, the one who would betray him said, surely not I, Rabbi. And Jesus answered, yes, it's you. Now I am reading from like a 1984 edition of the new international version. I mix it up. I try to use other ones sometimes too, but like this is just, I like, I know where everything is in this Bible. So I use this one that it's not like, and IV is the translation. Everyone should use there are lots of these that are great. I really like new living. I really like ESV. I don't know. I'm not trying to make a translation statement by the one I use. It's just the one that I got. And so what I will note is that the way the 1984 and IV renders this is a little bit different than the way pretty much every more recent mainstream English translation renders Jesus response to Judas, the people who are way, way, way more nimble with the Greek than I will ever be say in complete unison that what we get from Jesus here is not just the way I simply rendered it yesterday, which is kind of like David being confronted by the prophet and being told you are that man. And apparently it reads in the original language more like you said it. The more recent edition of the new international version, which I think is 2011 renders it thusly. You've said so. The Christian standard Bible says you've said it. The English standard version says you've said so and the new living translation says you've said it. Again, I feel like this one of those places where I need to apologize a little bit because my fumbling elementary Greek just isn't good enough to catch most of the little social nuances. I mean, every now and then I can read what somebody wrote about it and go back with all of that spelled out for me and be like, Oh, I get it. Yeah, I see it. And so again, like I just want you to know who you're dealing with here. I'm not some like fake humble person who's actually secretly super, super awesome at the biblical languages like I took the classes I do my best. I try to keep up on it, but I am no scholar of these languages and that kind of nuance, but it would just absolutely escape me without all kinds of help. So we got to depend on people who are way better at it. And that seems to be their consensus that Jesus is using some kind of turn of a phrase to be like, that's kind of on you. Like, you know what you're talking about yesterday as kind of imagining this scene as happening in front of everyone with little as sides occurring as people were jumping into conversations the way you would in an ancient Near Eastern meal like this. And I have to think that the big announcement, like somebody's going to betray me that that happened in front of everybody because all the disciples are sad and they all respond to it. But then it also looks like maybe this conversation with Judas is a bit of an aside. Everybody else has made their objection, maybe in private, maybe all very publicly. I have to imagine Peter said it in front of everybody, but maybe Judas is saying this as an aside to Jesus. And Jesus, you know, he doesn't probably want to get crucified very bad. I mean, he prays it if there's any way for that cup to pass from him that the father would allow that to happen here a little bit later on. But Jesus is clearly resolutely facing down his role in all of this. He knows what he's there to do. And he's seeing it through. He is not resisting. It's all going to happen. It's all going to happen. And it's due course of time. And so maybe this conversation with Judas is a bit of an aside so that the hand isn't tipped to everybody else as to the fact that it is Judas because like, I don't know, like, you got to think there would have been some kind of mass beating or something if they all knew it was going to be him. I'm not 100% sure. But what I am sure of is that we see a repetition of this little literary flourish over the next several verses two times. In chapter 26 and verse 64, and I don't want to spoil it all, but Jesus is going to be tried before the high priest and the Sanhedrin or part of the Sanhedrin and the high priest himself is going to come at Jesus and say, I charge you under oath by the living God. Tell us if you are the Christ, the son of God. And Jesus replies, yes, it's as you say. But again, that's the very safe English rendering of the 1984 NIV. Listen to these other translations. The NLT has Jesus using the same kind of a turn of phrase with the same apparently very evident to a good Greek scholar type of social flourish. They have him saying, you've said it. The CSB has it the same way. You've said it. And then the English standard version has Jesus saying you have said so I acknowledge once more that I'm spoiling absolutely everything. But then in chapter 27, Jesus is on trial before the governor Pontius Pilate. He gets asked a similar question, are you the king of the Jews? The 1984 NIV renders it very safely. They're using a dynamic equivalent. Like this is, this is what he was saying. If you understood the Greek, he's saying yes. That's the way they're treating it. So the 1984 NIV interprets Jesus words as a strong affirmative saying yes, it is as you say. But then once again, the ESV renders it, you've said so. The new living translation renders it, you have said it. And the Christian standard Bible, much like Doja Cat has him saying, you say so. I don't think this is Jesus just being snarky. I think there's a theme here that I'm a little bit having trouble putting my finger on, but it's there. I see it. I just don't totally get it yet. This theme is running throughout the book of Matthew. And it's how can I say it? It's like there's there's power and there's significance in people's confessions of Christ. And even the people who are wrong are confessing Christ or they know the reality that Christ is the Messiah. Think about Matthew 21 with the children who are saying, those Anna to the son of David, and then the religious leaders get mad because of what these innocent little tongues have confessed. As we've talked about a ton, Jesus quotes from Psalm 8, and maybe this quote is the cipher to this whole theme, this whole motif that I'm detecting here. But the quote is from the lips of children and infants, you have ordained praise. And I feel like that speaks back into Matthew 16 as well, where Jesus asks the question, who do people say that I am? Say, so there's that theme again. And they throw out a bunch of theories and then Peter's like, yeah, you're the Messiah, the Christ, son of the living God. And Jesus is like, yep, and that's not even from you. That's from God. And your eyes to this thing. I feel like we're making good progress on this, but I also think we need two episodes worth of time with it. So we're going to split this one in half and we're going to keep thinking about this say so theme and the way Jesus bounces it back at his enemies to make it clear that this isn't him aggressive on them by saying a truth about who he is. Rather, they know dang well who he is or should know dang well who he is and that the issue is with them for disregarding that and behaving in a way that is designed to in their minds thwart the plan of God, the good, redemptive plan of God. More on that next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
