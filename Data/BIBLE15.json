Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Ezra. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. Thanks for hanging out with me and talking about the Book of Ezra today, which is a sneaky, relatable book. It shouldn't be relatable. On paper, this book should be so foreign. It's a political thriller that looks like it's just a bunch of bureaucratic tension where the main narrative thrust of the story is, will the heroes find the proper requisition forms and fill them out before end of workday on Friday and get it in front of the right bureaucrat middle management type who will be sympathetic when he finds that form and approve it or will they not? Sounds boring, right? Sounds not relatable unless you're in that world and that line of work, but it is relatable because it's actually the story of a bunch of people realizing they had something beautiful and they wrecked it and then they get sad about the fact that they wrecked it and then they're faced with a choice that we're all faced with when we wreck something beautiful and realize it. And that is, do I one, keep my pride, blame other people and just wallow in self-pity and dream about what might have been forever? Or do I two do the difficult thing, admit that I screwed this thing up and that I had a hand in destroying something beautiful and then go about the difficult work of rebuilding something where I did damage? Well, in Ezra and Nehemiah, what you get is a bunch of very brave people saying, now we're going to admit our culpability in this and we're going to go do the very difficult work of rebuilding something beautiful. And then all the bureaucracy and the politics and all of that, that intrigue takes on a lot more meaning and it's a lot more fun. So here's what happened historically that sets up the book of Ezra because it can be a little disorienting when you turn the page from Second Kings or Second Chronicles, they both covered the same material and all of a sudden the world has changed as you turn over to Ezra chapter one. Well, here's how the world changed. In 722, the brutal cruel iron fisted Assyrians from up north finally had had enough of the shenanigans of the failed northern kingdom of Israel, which was representative of 10 tribes who descended from Jacob and Assyria comes in as like enough and they just crush the north. They take everyone away into captivity. The Assyrians do all kinds of forced resettlement and intermarriage program with the people they defeat in the south where the tribes of Judah and Benjamin are in the kingdom of Judah, the one that David's line continues through. We see them last about 140 ish years longer, but ultimately the same kind of mistakes that plagued the north bite the south and the butt and they get conquered by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. The Babylonians are the new big dogs by 586 BC when they conquered the southern kingdom. They've already done away with the Assyrians and the Babylonians are pretty iron fisted, but not as iron fisted as the Assyrians after they destroy the temple and destroy the sacrificial system and wreck all of Judah. They just leave a few people behind to be vine dressers and plowmen as the text puts it and everybody else they take away into captivity back to Babylon modern day Iraq modern day Baghdad, but this doesn't last very long because in 539 BC, so again, we're only talking about 45 ish years later, along come the Persians under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. Cyrus doesn't just conquer the regional power that is Babylon. Cyrus conquers everything the entire map of everything we've seen in the Bible up to this point. So we're not talking about a really powerful king or a little regional king. We're talking about something new when we talk about the king of Persia. We're talking about the decider. We're talking about a grand administrative state connected by a network of essentially pony express writers who could swap messages across everything in just a matter of days. This is an unprecedented bureaucratic state with one person at the head who is the bottleneck for all the decision making of the world as we know it. Here's the deal though. Persia learned some stuff from their predecessors who they displaced. The iron fistedness of Assyria and Babylon. It was brittle. It was frail. It didn't work. They couldn't keep everybody in line. So rather than making everyone horribly and exclusively fear the king, the Persians are like, what if we make them like us? What if we give them some adult responsibility and treat them like they know how to handle their own business and honor and respect their gods and their beliefs. And so Cyrus demonstrates that that is to be his administrative modus operandi in Ezra chapter one in the very first year of his reign by saying, all right, we got these people that are called the Jews and they're here in exile. Yeah, they should be allowed to go home and their religion is such that they need to worship in this temple. Well, then they should be allowed to rebuild that temple and they should be allowed to resume worship. And so what we've got at the beginning of Ezra chapter one is just a confluence of a bunch of really big history things. The northern kingdom deported and gone. The southern kingdom of Judah in exile in Babylon, but along comes this liberator from the east, a man who was prophesied in advance by name by Isaiah the prophet. This guy shows up and he does exactly what he's supposed to do. He takes a situation that seemed like it would never change. This exile is going to be forever and he flips it on its head and all of a sudden there's another chance. The tiny glimmer of hope that is all we were left with at the end of second Kings and at the end of second Chronicles has suddenly blossomed into something that gives us real reason for hope. So immediately at the beginning of Ezra, the exiles rally behind a guy named is a rubable who is a direct descendant of David. And if there was still a kingdom in Judah, he would be sitting on the throne in Jerusalem at this point. Now, he's not going to be a king, but he is going to be the one to lead the exiles back and rebuild the temple. And that's what he does in chapter three. He rebuilds the altar and they start sacrificing on that again. And then he starts clearing the temple rubble away and he rebuilds the beginnings of the foundation of the temple. And there's an event in chapter three that I think is so important to our understanding thematically of the whole Old Testament. At this event is a rubable and some of the priestly types get everybody together and they're like, look, we got a foundation going here. Look at the size of it and all of the Gen X types, generation, exile, they're young. They've never seen the temple. They've never seen anything like this before. And they're like, this is awesome. And they're cheering and celebrating and dancing and everything. But all of the old people who were little kids when the temple of Solomon got destroyed and they can still remember what it looked like. They're all crying loudly because they're like, Oh man, like this is great and all, but we will never recapture the splendor of this beautiful thing. We used to have and that we wrecked. And the author of Ezra says you couldn't tell the difference between the celebration and the morning and the sound of it all could be heard from a very long ways away. What an interesting metaphor for what we've seen play out in the whole Old Testament with this family that God made from Abraham. It's this mix of lament and beautiful stuff and both the good stuff and the ugly stuff can be heard from a long ways away by all the other nations and everybody else. Well, along comes some of the locals who never went into exile who were left there by the Assyrians or the Babylonians. And they're like, well, we worship your God. Can we help you build the temple? Is the rubables like no, scram beat it. And there are two schools of thought as to how this should be read. Number one is to say is a rubable was right. He could detect these people were up to no good. They were scoundrels. They were going to try to sabotage things. And so we ran them off. The second school of thought is this return from exile was imperfect. And what we see here is a rubable and then Ezra and Nehemiah are going to do the same thing later on over correcting mistakes they made in the first place so that now they're making some new mistakes the other way. I honestly am still not sure which one is happening here. So you just have to read that for yourself and see what you make of it. Well, either way, the result is the same. These non exiled locals feel jilted and they start resisting the rubable and this resistance goes on for several Persian kings reigns on down the road. Well, in the midst of this work kind of grinding to a halt in the midst of these bureaucratic complaints and delays, Cyrus the great dies. So he's the champion of this project and now he's out of the picture. His head stuffed in a bag full of wine by the queen of the Massagatai way up north. Well, what's his successor going to do? Well, his kids bungle the transition. Cambyses and another kid named Bardiah and the next great king to come out of all of this is not a descendant of Cyrus at all. It's a man named Darius and Darius doesn't know anything about this decree of Cyrus. So now we got a situation this reminiscent of when the Pharaoh in Egypt showed favor to Joseph and his family, but then some generations passed in the new Pharaoh didn't remember any of that stuff or what they owed Joseph and his family. And now you got a problem. Is it going to happen again or will Darius come around? Well, what we discover is that the Persians are more even handed and through a series of bureaucratic document filings, Darius becomes aware that the work has been stopped and has all held up in red tape and he's advised to go search the records and try to figure out if there was actually some decree to build this temple. So he goes and he looks and he finds it, but it's still binding because it was issued by Cyrus and the word of a king of Persia, the king of kings is binding from generation to generation. So Darius is not only like, yeah, resume the work, but here's a bunch more money and resources. What do you need? And things get rolling again. And then the temple is finished and we have a big dedication ceremony, not really nearly as big as the one we had when Solomon dedicated it, but we're all anticipating that just like when the tabernacle was dedicated and Solomon's temple was dedicated, there's going to be fire from the Lord and the cloud of the presence of God is going to visibly show up and he's going to live amongst his people. And it doesn't happen. He really comes and goes and there's no event. Then we fast forward a little ways to the life of Ezra and he finds favor with another Persian king down the road, Artaxerxes. And Artaxerxes is like, yeah, go back Ezra and finish out this temple project by fully recreating the temple culture and sacrificial system that you used to have there and build your people back up. It's a lot of paraphrasing on my part, but that's what happens. And so as we goes back, see some problems with how things are going with the exiles and whips them into shape again. And here we get something that's kind of reminiscent of Deuteronomy, almost like a reinvigorating of the covenant. Remember you got with generation two of the people wandering in the wilderness before they went into the promised land. Moses laid out the law and renewed the covenant kind of feels like that's what we're doing again here. Now that Ezra, this scribe of a priestly origin shows up in Jerusalem and he gets there and he's like, wow, it's really hard for us to show our dedication to God and to demonstrate that we understand how we wrecked something beautiful when we're making all the same mistakes boomed before. And he particularly is troubled by the intermarriage between the Jewish exiles and some of the local women. And so he gets everybody together and has a big meeting is like, this is sin. You need to call it sin. And you need to put away all of these wives. You need to cast them out and dissolve these marriages. Some people look at Ezra's behavior in the second half of the book of Ezra and they're like, yeah, that's what needed to happen. Like purge everything that was going wrong. And only then could you have any hope of getting things back on track because that intermarriage and that getting too cozy with foreign gods and ideologies, that's what wrecked the kingdom in the past. You can't make that mistake again. And other people would look at it and be like, oh, this might have been an odd, even bitter over correction that demonstrates that now we're into a new phase of God's own people sort of understanding God, but not totally understanding what God wants. Again, I'm not 100% sure on how I read it yet. And I'm going to reserve the right to keep thinking about that. I'll let you read it and make of it what you will. What I do know is this, with the artificial division between Ezra and Nehemiah, we get just a clunky, bummer, weird, let down ending to the book of Ezra. Are you ready for the last verse of Ezra? Get ready. This is a story about fixing something beautiful that you broke and moving forward with courage and admission of fault. This is the last sentence in this inspiring book, ready. All these had married foreign women and some of the women had even born children. The end. It feels very hollow coming on the heels of everything we've read. But in fairness, let's try to reserve judgment here until we've read the second half of the book, remembering that Ezra, Nehemiah is one book assembled by the same person. So let's see how this thing rounds out now that Nehemiah comes into focus as the main character next time around. When you think of Ezra, think of rebuilding a newer, smaller temple at the behest of a great Persian king and think of the zealous purging of certain cultural and marital practices that were going on with the exiles at that time. If you don't have time to read the whole book, make sure to catch the second half of chapter three, which is the dedication, if you will, of the foundation and that mixed response to it. And make sure to catch the second half of chapter six, which is the less than eventful dedication of the completed temple. And with that, let us congratulate each other on unlocking the Ezra achievement. We have leveled up. There's so, so, so, so, so much more here and it kills me not to get all the way into the rest of it, but hopefully we can pick up some of it in Nehemiah next time around. All right, I'm Matt.
