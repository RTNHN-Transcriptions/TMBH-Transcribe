This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and we're still working on this concept in Galatians 5 of Life by the spirit as opposed to life by the flesh We've been thinking about this for quite a while, but it's important and I'm trying to make sense of it for myself better Than it's ever made sense to me before So we're in the process of a few days of conversation where we're dipping back into some stuff from the gospels and from Jesus and Triangulating all of this out before we move forward here a little bit So I will have my dear close personal friend Jeffrey Foote play some music for us and then we'll pick up where we left off yesterday So So this is what I see the first part of the book is gonna be easy if you're a very analytical person You're gonna look at that you might have to slow down a little bit here and there and some of the trickier passages Maybe you'll struggle a little bit and have to really grind through the analogy about Abraham and Sarah and Hagar that you get Toward the end of chapter four. Maybe you're gonna have to pump the brakes a little bit in the middle of chapter three I'm like, okay. All right. How does the law work? What are we saying about the law? What parts of the Old Testament are we referencing here? Okay? Okay, get it But if you're an analytical person You're gonna be able to navigate the first four chapters and change of Galatians pretty clearly Paul lays out his thesis He is unhappy Paul goes through his own resume and history To make it clear that he is credible to be speaking to this you are talking with an expert here commissioned by God to be speaking to this He addresses some relational tension that might undermine his credibility and then he pivots deftly from that right into the heart of his argument Which is a theological one about in the grand abstract sense how anyone is made right with God Then he gives a personal appeal to say you should think what I'm telling you because it's a true And it's the message we were handed and that's that people who skew very Analytic are gonna be able to handle the first two-thirds of Galatians Better than the last two chapters of Galatians because when Paul gets into the stuff about your day in day out life as a Christian He is making the point that there is a degree of dependence that goes beyond pure logic and pure reason and Gets more into that stuff that we see back in the teachings of Jesus that involves pure trust pure dependence not just on God for salvation one time But on God on the presence of the Holy Spirit to walk in that spirit and navigate the complexities and difficulties of the battlefield the raging Parallist battlefield that is life the first two-thirds of Galatians could cause a reader like you and me And let's be honest probably most of you just given the way I talk and how this program works Probably most of you skew a little bit analytic. I'm an emotional creature, but I get there usually through Rational stuff first or at least I've learned how to mask it and make it feel like that I mean aren't we all emotional creatures There's just that some of us are quicker to go and craft the rationale to justify the emotion than others But for the most part my guess would be that most of you listening skew the same way I do which means that most of us who are in this conversation are going to be more challenged and less comfortable By the idea of dependence and walking by the spirit and not gratifying the desires of the flesh that we see in the last two-thirds because my hands are a little more off the wheel in this part This is the part where the rubber meets the road And I have to actually trust day in and day out that God is actually present in my life that the spirit is Actually here. It's not a simple paint by numbers or a thing where I just assent to a list of Ten Propositions and if I think all of those right things then I'm on the right side of this issue This is the part where you actually step out onto the raging battlefield is the laser blasts or flying hither and tither Then as the tie fighters are circling overhead and is the giant imperial walkers with the blasters are stomping around Then you go out into the fray and you actually live by the spirit you actually assume this posture of Dependence and life by the spirit. Yeah, it's tough. Okay, cool I'm willing to admit that but we shouldn't let the fact that it's tough or I should try not to let the fact that this is tough and Maybe a little intimidating. I shouldn't let that skew how I read the text because what I'm seeing here is a very rational guy The Apostle Paul taking you and me the reader into a place where he's saying all right. Well This is where we take the big step This is where we really figure out how committed we are to this thing because That harsh master that is the law that master might frustrate us that master might be pretty tough on us But it's safe and it's familiar. There's a clear list of things to do, but life by the spirit. That's the big bold Kingdom oriented risk way of life Sanctification this is the place where the consequences of the grace of Christ and the presence of God in our lives the presence of the spirit Really becomes evident because now you can take those big swings and that massive risk To go out and live a life that you could not live by the power of your own body and the power of your own Decision-making alone. It is life by the spirit It's challenging stuff, but it's beautiful stuff and it's necessary stuff and it clearly what Paul is talking about here at the end of Galatians This has always been the end game. This has always been the ultimate thing Look what's happening here. God isn't living in a temple anymore like we get in the Old Testament and there are certain Mediators who can go into the presence of God very briefly if they do everything right now You my friend you a son or daughter of the king listening to this if you are in Christ You are a new creation the old is gone. The new is come and you are indwelt by the Holy Spirit You kind of function like the temple now not like God. You're not God. I'm not God But the spirit of God now occupies Christians Not a building well one of the limitations of the temple is that it was not particularly mobile even when it was temporary and it was an Attend it still wasn't particularly mobile. It's inanimate one of the biggest advantages of how things are now Now that we have the spirit now that Christ has come and done what he did is that we are Terribly mobile massively mobile the temple and the whole relationship there with the presence of God It's scattered out into the world with every single person who is a Christian. It's massive opportunity Okay, I think I've got one more episodes worth of processing that I need to do here before we move on to the next stuff Galatians 5 19 and on to the end of the chapter. So I'm gonna hit pause here. I just want to say thanks real quick Handful of people jumped in to support the program. That was awesome of you. Thank you so much We are already printing up our Galatians achievement unlocked stickers that we're gonna mail out as soon as we're done with Galatians to commemorate this Season in life and the stuff we're processing through together right now. So thank you I just wanted you to know that I saw that you signed up for that really means a lot. I appreciate it Also, no one ever has to do that. It is so above and beyond and not expected or demanded it It's still kind of surprising me every time somebody's like yeah, I want to kick in on this thing So thank you. Also. Don't feel weird obligation on that front. I appreciate all you. I'm Matt is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
