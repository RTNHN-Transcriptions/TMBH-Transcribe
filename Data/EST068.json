"transcription_data": {"text": " a lot of times you read a book you watch a tv show particularly watch a tv show i guess for this example to make sense and the show happens to go somewhere that you know and you'll watch it and you'll be like exciting that's my town and then they actually show an establishing shot of your town and you go what the heck is that it's not it does not it at all it doesn't even look like it obviously van coover washington for a long time was the stand-in for every town everywhere the desert outside of la is the stand-in for every desert or scrub land or mountains scene anywhere because it's just it's close and you can shoot there i remember one time i was watching an old show it's called Jericho and i think they went to Cheyenne y-O-Ming and i'm like Cheyenne they're going to where i'm from i'm from Wyoming in northern Colorado this is going to be great establishing shot of Cheyenne is the CGI nightmare of something that looks kind of like how a child with Microsoft paint would imagine estus park colorado to be in the high match it just wasn't even close it was awful and here's the thing it doesn't matter it didn't affect the show at all but if nobody's been to Cheyenne it just it doesn't matter Cheyenne was just far away from Jericho Kansas good enough right because a lot of times in storytelling there's nothing about these various places that we go around to that is really important to the story because the story is entirely fiction and really we just need to go somewhere that's like it's in the west there now we're there okay now we got to go to a location that is somewhere in the american south great that looks good enough to stand in for you just go with it and as the viewer you accept that because the plot is not dependent in the case of that old show Jericho on any of the details of the geography or the institutions or the buildings in Cheyenne y-O-Ming being a certain way just whatever it works but in this story it's held out as though the details of sousa really matter the timeline really matters who was in charge of things really matters and so here at the end of chapter two i don't think we're just getting some magical fairyland throw away story about and there was an attempt on the king's life somewhere once upon a time the details are so robust and in keeping with what we know from extra biblical history that it looks like what's being described at the end of ester chapter two is an assassination attempt on the king of land so the king of kings Xerxes the first that everybody would have known about including knowing the names of the conspirators this is written as though the author of ester is trying to help the reader connect the dots and draw on pre-existing knowledge of this king and the Xerxian era to help orient themselves with where things are in this more discrete story this more behind the scenes story that is being told about ester so bear that in mind and check out this story here that ends with a hanging ester 221 during the time mortik i was sitting at the king's gate i think we talked about yesterday an actual gate you can still go to everybody could have pictured it it's not like a gate that could be on a town somewhere this is the king's gate it's on that wall on that side of that palace in that city of susa and it was at its most beautiful and prominent during the era of darius and Xerxes again we have extra biblical inscriptions to support that so during that time at that gate these two guys bikthina and taresh two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway became angry and conspired to assassinate king Xerxes the author of esters given us those two names to differentiate this plot against the king that resulted in public executions from other plots against the king that also resulted in public executions people around susa and the seats of power of purgia would have remembered this but also these kinds of examples usually got advertised especially given the way we know Xerxes does business i mean he advertised his wife disrespected him at a drunken party one time he's going to advertise this as well at the behest of the same seven influencers and council members who had him advertise what vashty did to disrespect him so word is going to spread that these two guys are disgraced for having plotted against the king that plots against the king don't work you will get found out you will be hung and your family will pay the consequences this is how a king in this era would avoid anybody trying to duplicate that so the specifics that we're getting here from the author of ester are designed to really precisely orient us in time and what the reader is supposed to do is to be like well wait a minute did mortik and ester have something to do with that plot or having it foiled in the answer my dear reader friend is yep verse 22 but mortik i found out about the plot and told queen ester who in turn reported it to the king giving credit to mortik i so that's how these dirt bags who were going to kill the king of kings got found out and already we are seeing that the providential positioning of ester though it has not yet been good for the jews it has been good for zirksies zirksies thought he was just picking the prettiest girl to be his new wife but what he didn't realize is that with ester the bonus was he also got an agent whose eyes and ears would be faithful and loyal to him both out of loyalty to the king but also out of loyalty to his ward his charge his adoptive kid ester and mortik i is a man of virtue and so he won't allow this plot to stand and in doing so he ingratiates himself to the king verse 23 and when the report was investigated and found to be true the two officials were hanged on a gallows all this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king can we're going to talk about the ingratiation that i just promised in a second but first let's talk about the hanging this seems to have been a popular way with darius and zirksies of killing people who needed killed because you'll recall that after darius found the proclamation of syrus that said indeed and you guys can go and rebuild your temple darius expanded that proclamation that was found in the archives of echbotana another one of the capitals of the persians the old capital of the Medes and in esra i think chapter four actually i brought a bible with me i'm just going to turn it on there and make sure it was esra chapter four no i'm an idiot this is why i don't have friends and nobody loves me it's esra chapter six at the end of esra chapter six darius adds to the decree of syrus saying furthermore i decree that if anyone changes this edict a beam is to be pulled from his house and he has to be lifted up and impaled on it and for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble may god who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change the decree or to destroy this temple in jruslem is that really about his love for jruslem and the god of the jus no it's about his love for continuity from syrus and stabilizing his reign and his authority so it seems like this public hanging or public impaling it might be the same execution technique being described here with just different words that are slightly difficult to translate either way it looks like the preferred method of execution was this public impaling or hanging maybe even with the beam of these people's own building to symbolize you are impaled upon this visual symbol of the stability of your family name and your house this is the ultimate punishment the ultimate example making that happens here for these guys so on the one hand we read that and we're like hooray that's good the the bad guys got it and morte chi ingratiates himself but at the same time we're also reminded every time things look good there's something dangerous lurking right around the corner so we want to keep an eye out for banquets moving forward that are chased with intrigue resulting in people getting impaled on beams and gallows of their own making and it might seem a little bit much like maybe xerxes is a little bit paranoid here maybe these guys were just shooting the breeze but the truth is xerxes definitely had reason to be concerned about assassination plots in fact it's an assassination plot that ends the reign of king xerxes in august of 465 artabanus not the artabanus who was the uncle of xerxes who remember in that passage we read from Herodotus counseled dairius against going to war against the cydians and then counseled his son xerxes against going to war against the greeks but then remember xerxes had a dream and in the dream he was told by some kind of Zoroastrian angel to go and change some things about what he was doing and then he's like what the heck and then a story that kind of echoes giddy in and putting out a fleece from the bible xerxes has artabanus dress up like him and sit there and see if he has the same vision and he does and they're like we're friends now we're gonna invade greece together god wills it and then maybe not kind of a funny outcome when you think of it that way but then this artabanus is a different guy a younger guy the one who ultimately kills xerxes he does this deed 20 years after that war council where artabanus dressed up like xerxes a different guy and his deal was that he got tangled up in the eunuch culture the culture that was going on behind the scenes that pushed ester to the front of the line people from that crowd may be hegii there's a reasonable chance that the reason the author of ester keeps dropping that name is because there is some kind of irony there that maybe this hegii fellow was one of the people who 20 years later after the events described in ester did get tangled up in this assassination plot what we know is that the back rooms and the group of eunuchs who served and advised to the king they became entangled with people who wanted xerxes gone and ultimately it was a eunuch and this other artabanus who did kill xerxes and ended his reign in that way and so if ester was written a few decades after the fact then everybody would have that in mind as well as they read ester chapter two that we're talking about eunuchs and court behind the scenes culture and we're talking about two would-be assassins all of this would be a very evocative for the original audience because this would be like the Kennedy assassination bigger than the Kennedy assassination if this were written after xerxes was assassinated well whatever the case we know for sure that all this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king and Herodotus who you remember a few days ago i was like goodbye Herodotus it's been really good we will miss you as though we were never going to read from him again my bad on that is i shouldn't have done an emotional goodbye like that Herodotus mentions this record that the king kept king xerxes kept of his benefactors and Herodotus tells us that some people who served the king in Greece on account of those deeds became despot of samus so they got rewarded with the a place to rule over appointed by the Persians and huoboi phyla coast was recorded as a benefactor of the king and received much land as a reward that's in book eight of the history section 85 and of course yesterday we talked about the story of siloson the guy who gave darius that cloak when darius was a great big nobody then he showed back up at the king's gate in susa later on i was like i'm a cloak guy remember me and darius was like yeah and you are mentally in my list of benefactors i'm going to go sweep an island to clean for you and let you be the ruler of that because thank you so this is clearly a practice that the original audience would have been really clear on these guys keep a record of the people who wronged them and they keep a record of the people who were good to them who served them and they try to pay off both of those things in appropriate ways meaning the original audience would know this list it would be a huge deal that mortikai is on this list ester participated in it so mentally she's in even better stead in the mind of xerxes and now we just wait until the payoff comes when will the king reward this benefactor who saved his life again a passage like this makes it really clear that ester is not meant to be understood as a fairy tale where the location and the setting don't matter the way ester is composed assumes that the original audience would be connecting a whole bunch of dots and be like oh i know that guy i know that guy i know that guy and if recently you happen to put in like you know 40 episodes worth of work to understand a little bit more about this era of purgian history details like this also turn out to be a really nice payoff for you and me so i think this is a blast and the story it's dangerous it's high stakes but it's shaping up in a promising way for good things to come out of this and matt is the 10 minute bible hour podcast let's do
