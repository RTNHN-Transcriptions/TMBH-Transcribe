I don't watch anything on Hulu. I don't know why I forget that it exists, I suppose, but somehow this thing got pointed out to me. It's a murder mystery. It's kind of the style of Ryan Johnson's Knives Out, which I thought was delightful. That Chris Evans sweater, I continue to think that's the pinnacle of male fashion. I really enjoyed that show. Didn't like the Glass Onion sequel nearly as much, but Knives Out was cool. And this show that I watched on Hulu, it was all presented kind of that style. And in the midst of that, there's a scenario, maybe one of the juiciest parts of the show, where the bad guys are, they're mostly the bad guy, but they're kind of like a Thanos-style bad guy, where they're like, no, all of you people are corrupt with your money and your power and your dirty insider trading, you corporate shenanigans. And we're going to put you all in a trap. And this trap is going to have a timeline on it. And when the timeline goes off, everybody dies, but we'll save nine of you. And they take bids from all of these super rich people to really expose them for what they are. In the end, well, maybe you've tried to get into what show I'm talking about. So I'm not going to tell you what happens in the end. But ultimately the point was that in this mad scramble, when push really came to shove, everybody got to see who their friends and family actually were. And it was pretty wild. Now, likewise, in Nehemiah chapter four, I have got to imagine that Sanbalat thinks that Nehemiah is worshiping the wrong God or worshiping the right God in such a wrong way that Nehemiah's prayers are falling on deaf ears. You're in the wrong city. You're worshiping at the wrong temple. You're totally missing the point. Sanbalat, you'll recall, is a Samaritan. So they got a different place where they think worship should happen. I think these two diverged enough that Sanbalat would be very skeptical that any of Nehemiah's prayers, the gentle ones or a Nehemiah for the grumpier ones have any answer. Any actual merit or any actual potency at all. But even if Sanbalat believes that Nehemiah's prayers are going to basically nowhere, still what the prayers are tells you when push comes to shove about where Nehemiah is actually at in relationship to Sanbalat. So Nehemiah's very, I'd say harsh, very justice oriented, even judgment oriented prayers against Sanbalat. You could even call these curses are going to tell Sanbalat, okay, this guy's, I mean, he's treating me as an enemy as I am treating him as an enemy. He sees what I'm doing. He sees through what I'm doing. And even though Nehemiah's prayers, Sanbalat might believe, are going to absolutely nowhere, this is still very telling about my nemesis here and what he believes and where his head is at in relationship to me. So Nehemiah, we looked at the first part of this prayer yesterday. It is indeed harsh of you, a little bit uncomfortable at the same time yesterday. We talked about the fact that if there is a God who knows all the things about everything and is unlimited in every way and is powerful enough to actually answer prayers, it means that God would also know what you're actually thinking as opposed to whatever flowery language we might try to use to dress it up with lipstick on up a perfume on it. And the truth is, if God knows everything, he knows the deepest recesses of the heart even better than we know our own heart. So I mean, when these harsher prayers come out from time to time in life, whether they are justified or not, there's no hiding it. God knows that's where somebody's heads at. If indeed there is a God with this kind of power and this kind of knowledge. So Nehemiah just bows right through it. He's like, I'm just going to say exactly what I think and what I'm doing. He's a bold fellow and he says, here us, oh, our God, for we are despised, turn their insults back on their own heads, give them over as plunder and a land of captivity. Well, that reflexive property that turned their insults back over on their own heads. I mean, we talked yesterday about how that's a, I think a reference back to what God just got done doing with Haman and his ilk with the whole Esther and Mordecai affair. It's all a big grand reversal. He looked at 15 reversals in the book of Esther in our last season going through that book together. But then this next principle in this really potent visceral prayer from Nehemiah is also pretty dang harsh. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. Now, look, if you are listening to this in my country, the United States or most of the Western world, we have been pretty comfortable with our quote unquote empire for a very long time. We have to come under serious threat externally in our lifetimes. I mean, it feels pretty invincible, but the reality is every empire that has ever existed has fallen. All of them goes away at morphs into something else. It gets weak, soft and fat from the inside, whatever it beats itself. I don't know. One way or another, they just all ultimately go away. This isn't fun to hear, but so will this one. I don't know how I'm not saying whose fault it's going to be. I'm not making any political statement. I'm just stating a historical reality. Empires fall. It's the nature of empires to burn real, real hot and then to have stuff go wrong and in a one calamitous day or one calamitous generation, the whole thing goes away. So the idea though, for us of plunder being something you worry about that is raging hoards who are angry about the relationship between your two nations, kicking down the doors and raiding your cities and taking away slaves and captives and all the things that you've built, maybe even killing the people who live in the houses and taking them over for themselves, hauling away the treasures from Fort Knox back to wherever. It's just unfathomable. You can't imagine it, but the people of Persia couldn't imagine Alexander the Great showing up and their empire being toppled either. The people of Babylon were having a big, fat, luxuriant gold party the night that Cyrus the Great showed up. They couldn't imagine that the whole thing was ever going to end. Apologies. I didn't mean to go back to that point. The point is the plunder isn't something you and I worry about. And so this is going to seem pretty foreign, but in the ancient world, especially for all of these smaller kingdoms and city states, plunder is something you worried about all the time. It was the ultimate being dunked on. It was the ultimate statement of the complete and abject defeat and failure, not just of your military, not just of your politics, but of your way of life. That foreign God and the culture born out of the worship of that foreign God produced something better and more powerful than the worship of your God. And the result is their God dunked on your God. There was nothing you could do to even defend your most precious items or your household and your family. And so the hoards came in and you just had to sit there if you were lucky enough to still be alive and watched your stuff get hauled away, watch your identity get hauled away. To be plundered was the most humiliating thing that could happen. It was the most identity wrecking thing that could happen. And indeed, most people who got plundered or lost to history, we don't even know their names, they're forgotten. There's no clear genetic lineage or any record of who they are. They're just gone, absorbed or destroyed. So this is a pretty big deal. So for Nehemiah to throw that down, even if sambalot doesn't believe that Nehemiah is praying to any real God is like, whoa, dang. Okay, well, that's a pretty big deal. Now, I don't think sambalot will be totally surprised by it because he's been basically urging for the plunder and the destruction of the Jewish people. So everybody's at each other here for good reasons. The difference is the Bible holds out Nehemiah and Ezra and the returning exiles as being for the first time in a long time, actually getting things right and doing stuff that is at least in the neighborhood of God's redemptive plan. And indeed, as we talked about in John chapter four, Jesus seems to affirm that sambalot's on the wrong side of this question and that Ezra and Nehemiah are roughly on the right side of this question. But this language of plunder being something that boomerangs back on you is something that comes up in the writing of the prophet Habakkuk. This guy was writing around the same time as Jeremiah just a few years before Nebuchadnezzar showed up in 586 BC. So Habakkuk has heard the prophecies of Jeremiah. He knows that those prophecies are real. He can also read the political writing on the wall. He knows that the kingdom of Judah in its final years is a cesspool. Everything's backwards morally ethically in terms of justice. It's just wrecked. And God is making it clear to Habakkuk, hey, I'm going to punish the people and I'm going to use the Babylonians and other corrupt nations to do it. And this makes Habakkuk grumpy. And so the whole book is really framed around two questions and a few final remarks that Habakkuk asks of God. Question number one, how long oh Lord must I call for help, but you do not listen or cry out to you violence, but you do not save. Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong destruction and violence are before me? There's strife and conflict to balance. Therefore the law is paralyzed and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous so that justice is perverted. The question is basically why did you let it get this bad with your people? Why didn't you stop us? Why didn't you do something? And God answers that question by a firm. Yeah, I'm raising up the Babylonians and they're going to come along and judge you and you picked this. And then Habakk is like, okay, well then question number two, why are you using people who are even wickeder than us to judge us? The Babylonians come on paraphrases mind, but it's not really much of a paraphrase. He kind of gives Habakkuk the same treatment here and is like, well, look, I'll do whatever I want to do, but also don't think for a second that the Babylonians will escape judgment. They have it coming as well. And this is maybe some of the language that Nehemiah is calling back on because we've noticed that Nehemiah's prayers are all reflective of things God has said in scripture. He likes to quote back to God what God has said to him in his prayers. And it kind of feels like he might be referencing this from about a hundred and sixty years before the events being described in Nehemiah. God says this to Habakkuk and Habakkuk 27, will not your debtors suddenly arise? Will not they wake up and make you tremble? Then you'll become their victim because you have plundered many nations. He's talking to Babylon here. The people who are left will plunder you for you have shed man's blood. You have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. So Babylon will be held to account for their actions even though God is sovereignly using them to correct the failures of his own people and to fulfill and carry out the terms of the covenant that he made with them. It feels like Nehemiah is latching onto this in movement number two of his imprecatory prayer against the enemies of the rebuilding of Jerusalem when he prays probably very publicly give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. They want to shame us. They want to plunder us. They want to destroy the way of life based on the worship of you. Oh God, do that to them instead. It's pretty harsh. It's pretty direct. Even if sandballot doesn't believe that prayer is going anywhere, he's getting a real clear sense of where Nehemiah's head is at and how seriously Nehemiah is taking the threats that are coming from sandballot. And then finally tomorrow we'll go and look at the third and final movement in this imprecatory prayer. This dare we call it a curse upon sandballot and the enemies of the work in rebuilding Jerusalem that Nehemiah is undertaking. It's kind of fun stuff. It's also kind of scary. It just is what it is. We just cover whatever's next in the Bible. And that's just what we just what we do and the sound things are. Okay, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
