It's fast, fun, free, daily, deep-dye Bible. And right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here, or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy-to-use format at TheTMBH.com. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and you just heard that. It occurs to me. I'm recording this on a Wednesday, which means that's going to come out tomorrow. That's a Thursday. So you did just hear that, right? From Camilla, my wife, I've got her doing a new intro thing. This is not how I wanted to start, but here we are. We're just going to roll with it. We're doing that on Mondays and Thursdays, where she sort of just explains the whole thing that's going on here. I think it's important, because I know a lot of you have been here since forever. Hey, what's up? I see you all again. But I know a lot of you are relatively new, and I think that it could be kind of intimidating jumping into a conversation like this. You could feel like, oh, I'll never catch up. Yeah, you will. It'll work. There'll be something for you on your first day. You're totally welcome. It's going to be awesome. But I kind of wanted to put that thing in there so that every couple of episodes, people could just have the mental reset. It's all right. What are we actually doing here? And how does it work? And what if I want more? Did you catch that part that we added the thing about the website, TheTMBH.com? Also not what we were going to talk about. We're already a minute in. Whatever. We're just rolling with it now. So it works if you go to mattwittman.com because I labored for years to finally get that URL and the saga is over. I got it. They did not give it to me. I don't know how I feel about how that all went down, but I have it. I spent money on it. And now if you just, my name, Matt Whitman and then Dot and then Com, it just happens. It takes you to the website. I think it's pretty cool. So thank you to my lovely wife who dresses up the whole thing. She's kind and smart and gentle and graceful as she sounds. And I think we're all better from having her check in from time to time like that. Okay. Here's what I was actually going to open with though is speaking of being a love. Haha. Art of the segue. When you hear the term star crossed lovers, what does that conjure for you? Hopefully not me and Camilla. I don't think we're star crossed lovers. I think we just like love lovers like the kind of lovers where it works out and the stars and the heavens are not superstitiously aligning and conspiring against us because it's just happy like theoretically, if you're in a happy marriage, you wouldn't be like, Oh, yeah, you know, I'm so and so and my husband is so and so and we are star crossed lovers. No, ladies. I don't think you want to say that. And gentlemen, I don't think your wife would feel great to have you describe her that way. Star crossed lovers are tragic. It's well, no, I'm not going to list off any examples yet because I want you to think of them first because they'll be more fun if we happen to brainstorm the same ones. But it's when something goes way wrong, when death or circumstances or crisis takes a love that could have worked in another life in another reality and makes it not work. And I think it's more than just tragic, right? When you say tragic, that could be the kind of thing where it was a love that worked, but then something horrible happened to a happy life or a happy marriage. I think star crossed tends to mean that all the circumstances conspired against it working out in tragedy. Therefore, it's just a foregone conclusion. Let's just do this thing. Who do you come up with? Literature, history, that guy that you're Antmet at the music festival, anything. What do you got? Here we go. I'm just going to stall for a minute so that you have time to think about it so that then if we say the same things, we can make the gesture where we make the peace sign. We point it our eyes and then at the other person's eyes and be like, I see you. We're together stalling over with. All right. Here's the first one that comes to mind for me. Romeo and Juliet, right? Some most obvious. Yeah. Yeah. The five's all around. You're all thinking of the same thing. It's fiction, but it's the quintessential star crossed lovers story. Maybe the modern version of that would be the notebook. It sort of almost works out for a second, but I want to ruin it, but kind of doesn't. Yeah. I think that would be the Nicholas Sparks version of it. Maybe other modern fiction, maybe forest and Jenny. I mean, that kind of works out a little bit at the very end, but it always seems like the ebb and flow of history in the 1950s, 60s and 70s is always conspiring against them. Let's go history. Bonnie and Clyde, are they star crossed lovers? I don't know that I know enough about what their relationship was like. I just know a lot about hijinks they pulled and how it ended. And that was certainly tragic. I mean, depending on your point of view, I guess. Let's go further back. Oh, here's one. This is Shakespeare and history. How about Anthony and Cleopatra? These two were on the losing side of history in the Mad Scramble for Power after the assassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March, 44 BC. And eventually the Mad Scramble for Power resulted in a victory for Octavian, who took on the name Caesar Augustus, establishing the imperial rule in the new Roman Empire. And when it became evident that the lovers, Anthony and Cleopatra were not going to win, they independently committed suicide and hers is particularly memorable, though never admirable. She committed suicide via Cobra. It was pretty wild. Okay, we got one more. I was thinking about, oh, I remember the other one that came to mind. This is a juicy one. The Lard and Heluis. You ever hear this story? Abelard was a scholastic. He's one of these great thinkers in medieval Europe who tried to synthesize the scientific consensus of the great minds of the day and the ancient past with the teachings of the church. And he falls sort in the middle of this chronological run of the scholastic era. Maybe Anzom would be the guy you'd put on the front end. I think that's right. And on the back end, it would be William of Occam, the guy who gives us Occam's razor. But Aquinas is a scholastic. All right, so you got these guys and Abelard, he's super, super smart. And he gets a role as a tutor for a nobleman's daughter. You can assume where this one is going. And even though he's way older than her, they fall in love. Of course, the counter, the Duke or the whoever he doesn't like it at all. And there's a brutal description that comes down to us of how the castration ordered by the nobleman was carried out. And it was bad and forced castration is super, super tough on the long term prospects of a relationship. But they didn't break up after that. They just got separated by force. They both got forced into a monastic life and they wrote each other love letters back and forth all the way until the end of their days, even though they never saw each other again. Star crossed lovers. And you might be looking at the clock and going like, what? Why are we doing this? Because Nehemiah, right? Because we're still going to talk about the Bible or whatever. Yes. But every now and then, we just have one thing that we want to get in on a given day. And it's kind of fun to set it against the backdrop of a bunch of things, a bunch of patterns we see throughout history that we've thought about. And we talked about your call over the last couple of days here. I've been saying that the queen being present in Nehemiah chapter two, when Nehemiah goes to make his request is a pretty big wild card in this whole equation because we don't know much about her. We don't know if she liked Nehemiah. We don't know if the king was different when the queen was around. We don't know if the king Artaxerxes was more likely to grant the request because the queen was present or more likely to deny the request because the queen was present. It's all a great big riddle. But I was telling you, remember that from her perspective in the ancient world, if he dies, she dies. If he dies, all of her kids are in danger. That's how a dynastic crisis works. She saw a dynastic crisis in the previous transfer of power that ended with Artaxerxes becoming king. These things don't go well. Darius, does Xerxes went okay? But there was a huge dynastic crisis after the death of Cyrus that ultimately resulted in a bunch of death, maybe murder and Darius becoming king. I mean, there's a lot at stake. It doesn't go well when kings die. Smooth transfers of power aren't real common and queens stand to lose an awful lot under those circumstances. So this lady's sitting there knowing what happened to a whole bunch of people from the royal family the last time power changed. She knows what happened to the families of a whole bunch of noblemen, famously under the reign of Darius, particularly one named Artabanos, who you and I talked about, who approached the king in a way he thought was inappropriate. And wow, he was very vengeful toward the family of Artabanos and his family. She knows what happens when her father-in-law, Xerxes, got mixed up with a lady on his trip coming back from the invasion of Greece that failed and how that ended up with that lady being mutilated beyond recognition and her husband killed. I mean, this stuff is salty. So look, I mean, what's going through this poor lady's mind is this request is coming up from the person who really is one of the chief, most trusted, maybe the most chief trusted attendant to the safety of her husband. She has to have known that there was a risk to her because of all of this. Now, Nehemiah's trip as best as we can tell does not negatively affect her at all. I mean, just pop that balloon right now. Stuff works out. Artaxerxes rules for a long time after this and under his reign, the exiles who had returned to Jerusalem thrive. It's a really good thing for them. But if Artaxerxes' wife was concerned that ill-fate befalling Artaxerxes would mean ill-fate befalling her, her concerns were well-placed. And if in the moment that Nehemiah asked this question and she silently sat there thinking, this does not portend well for me. This does not bode well for me. Such a lapse in security is exactly the kind of thing that's probably going to get my husband and me someday. Well, then her musing turned out to be prophetic, turned out to be true. Here's the tiny bit we know about this woman who's sitting on the throne in the throne room scene in Nehemiah 2.6. Her name is Demaspia. And we know that from a semi-reliable pseudo-historian named T.C. Ace of Nitus. We talked about him a little bit early on in the stuff we did about Esther and a little bit right at the end. He doesn't give us a lot about her derserxes, but he does give us this T.C. Ace of Nitus here. Arterserxes was succeeded by his son Xerxes after his death. This would be Xerxes II. His only legitimate son by Demaspia, that's the lady sitting on the throne in Nehemiah 2, who died on the same day as her husband. The bodies of the king and queen were conveyed by Bagorazus to Persis. Now things got crazy after their death, so if she imagined there would be a succession crisis that would befall them if they happened to die tragically the same way, she imagined right. Their son Xerxes II reigned for only a few days, got killed while he was drunk, then another son, Sogdianus took over and reigned very briefly as well. In the end, it is a bastard son of Arterserxes, Ochus, who will reign for a meaningful period of time after the reign of Arterserxes. We'll talk more about all of that stuff later, but the point is this. There's a lot of dudes in the story of Nehemiah, the main human character in the last one was a woman, but not a lot of women come up in Nehemiah, but we see this lady briefly. And even though she only gets a second of screen time, there are a gillion things that must have gone through her mind here, knowing how history worked out then, how things have worked out for so many tragic lovers, even star crossed lovers since. And I don't think it's too much of a stretch to imagine that a whole bunch of things were running through her head about the potential implications now or later of her husband's soft spot on a security question like this one and how that might affect her and their legacy down the road. Ultimately, we don't know exactly what happened to them, but I don't think it's a coincidence that they died on the same day. And I bet if we were doing a podcast in 400 BC and we asked a bunch of Persian listeners to name a pair of star crossed lovers or tragic lovers, they would have said Artaxerxes and Demaspia. I just thought that was super interesting and that little peek into the future deserved a moment of our time. I had fun. Tomorrow, we're going to look at some more ancient historical accounts and another big chunk of Nehemiah chapter two to find out how the rest of this conversation between Nehemiah and the king wraps up. Thanks for listening to my thing. Thanks to lovely Camila for dressing up my thing with your beautiful voice. Alright, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
