This is a 10 minute Bible Hour podcast, and this is kind of a fun thing. Mind melting moment years ago when I took a whole bunch of my friends with me and we all went to Rome and just wanted to go and see the history and see the places where the stuff we read about in books and even in the Bible happened. So we did a bunch of Italy stuff. It was a great trip, just a blast with my friends. But there's this once real moment that still stands out to me and that took my head to some weird places. We were by the Colosseum and just across the street from the Colosseum is the Domus area. It's a place where Nero built his golden house in the 60s AD. I don't know if you remember Nero from history, but he's kind of crazy, maniacal, violent. He gained power through violence. He had weird, violent family members. He did violent things. Peter and Paul both died in Rome during his reign and famously Nero is the guy who, you know, the fire in Rome happened during his reign. And then he blamed Christians for it and to kind of send a message to anybody else who would cause problems in Rome. He rounded up some Christians, dipped them in pitch, put them on pikes and lit his garden. In this very area where I was standing, he lit them, lit the garden with Christians. And so I'm standing there in this moment looking at the beautiful romantic Colosseum. I think the song Sex on Fire by Kings of Leon was playing in the background. I don't know why that it's just stuck in my brain. That's a song that was on. And the Domus area is not really all cleaned up. It's not a developed archaeological site fully. So there's volleyball and basketball and people bumming around. It's kind of dirty, but also there's some cool stuff there and I'm taking in all of those different layers of history around me. What next to me on a bench is a dude from Rome all dressed up in Roman imperial soldier attire, like plastic armor. And he's got his helmet off under one arm. He's got a cigarette in between his fingers. He's banging out at text on like a primitive cell phone, like a Palm pilot or something like that, Blackberry from back in the day. Then to top the whole thing off, a big giant double decker bus rolls by between me and the Domus area, the, you know, Nero's area and the Colosseum. And it's got a huge larger than life image of Miley Cyrus as Hannah Montana on the side of it. And I just paused for a moment right there. I mean, I went to that spot to reflect on my fallen brothers and sisters who died there years earlier. I wanted that moment of reflection. And instead I get this surreal moment of layers and layers and layers of history and culture and stuff that doesn't really fit together neatly, confluancing in one crazy moment of bizarre awareness about my little place in the grand scheme of everything and about how complex and intersectional all of history is. I mean, this is probably super obvious to all of you. It's just that's the moment that I think my eyes were opened to that reality about living in the world and the history of everything. And it's not just Rome. It's not just right there. It's everywhere. Right? And the idea that reality is made up of all of these confluences of things coming together. Every interesting moment of your life is a confluence of a bajillion other stories that all come together in that moment. Every big dramatic moment in history isn't happening in a vacuum. There's a ton of things that contributed to that moment. And of course, likewise, when we pick up a book of the Bible like Nehemiah or in this case, Ezra and Nehemiah, because it really are kind of one book. We're going to look a little bit at Ezra. We're really in the throw most of our energy here at Nehemiah. But when you pick up a book like this, you're not just getting a little snapshot in history that happens in a vacuum or a bubble. You're getting again a robust moment in history that is a confluence of a bajillion little factors that all add up to make the unique moment, the unique setting, the unique set of pressures and questions felt by all of the characters in this unique particular book. So over the next couple of days, we're going to look at what we know about all of those factors that are coming together to create the unique moment that we're seeing here in the book of Nehemiah. Now in the last season I did, season three on Esther, we did a huge historical deep dive into this kind of stuff. We looked at the history of the Persian Empire and all of the different leaders and how they got to where they're going and the wars and the battles and the culture and the artifacts and all of that stuff. It took 42 episodes. It was a lot. It does not make sense for me time wise to do that again here. A kind of sense that Nehemiah is going to move it a little bit faster clip than maybe Esther did. So if you want that stuff and maybe you were here for Esther, but you forgot a little bit of it, you can always just go and catch those first 42 episodes of the last season or if you're here for the first time and we start to get into the Nehemiah stuff and you're like, man, I'd like to know more about that. Hey, go back to Esther at some point and just power through those episodes as you have time. I think you'll enjoy it. The way we're going to do it in this season is we're just going to kind of pick it up as we go along. So we're going to fill in those details and we're going to get a very robust picture, I think of this moment, this confluence that is the setting of Nehemiah, but it's going to happen along the way a little bit more. So over the next couple of days though, we just need to do the very brief basic setting of the table the same way I just did with the confluential moment in front of the Colosseum from years ago with Hannah Montana and Kings of Leon and the guy in the armor with the Palm Pilot and everything else that was going on there. And I think once we've got those basic elements, we're going to be set up a lot better to understand where the story goes next. So big, big, big picture, Nehemiah or Ezra and Nehemiah, again, they've always been treated as one book or were long treated as one book by the Jewish people. And it's in Christian Bibles that the Ezra and Nehemiah for whatever reason, they're separated out into two separate things. But Ezra and Nehemiah basically tell one cohesive story that picks up right where the book of second Chronicles leaves off and runs into the mid 400s at the end of the life and work of these two guys, Ezra and Nehemiah. The simple gist of these two books is this. The Jewish people had been in exile for a long time. They got taken there not by the Persians. The Persians are the ones in charge as we encounter Ezra and Nehemiah, but rather by their predecessors, the Babylonians. If you don't remember who all these different groups are, don't worry about it. We're going to dive deeper into who they all are and where they all fit here in the next little bit. The Babylonians conquered the Jewish people in 586 BC, King Nebuchadnezzar did that and took them into exile to go and live in Babylon. And it looks like they're just doomed because a people group, they're going to be gone forgotten. They'll just intermarry with everybody. Their unique relationship with God will go away. This redemptive plan that has been all over the pages of the Old Testament up to this point. Unfortunately, it looks like it's just not going to work out. Babylon wins the Jews lose the end, but that isn't how it plays out. Instead, Babylon turns out to be a really short-lived empire and along comes this hitherto unknown people group called the Persians. And they've got a cousin people group called the Medes. The Medes play their cards wrong. And after the Medes and the Persians conquer the Babylonians around 540 BC, the Medes quickly are absorbed into the larger impulses and growth of the Persians. And this series of great, powerful Persian emperors come along and they start shaking up the whole world. You've got a guy named Cyrus. He's the conqueror and the initiator of this whole new Persian empire. And he comes to power in 539 BC in an event that's recorded in the book of Daniel. And immediately he's like, all right, well, we're going to govern totally differently than all of the other emperors before and the other empires before. What do we got here? The Jewish people. What are they into? Well, it looks like they're missing a temple. They'd probably be better off if they had one of those. And so he lets the Jews who had been captives and exiles go free if they want to and just go back and rebuild the temple. And he even agrees to pay for a bunch of it. This is crazy. Now rebuilding the temple is as easy as we'll see as we get into the book of Ezra. But eventually they get it done and they dedicate a new temple to replace the old temple they had that got destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. This is gigantic. All of a sudden now it looks like maybe everything's back on. Maybe there will continue to be Jews. Maybe God's redemptive plan will continue to be a thing. I mean, this is awesome, but they're not totally out of the woods because even though the Jews receive the support of King Cyrus and then effectively his next significant successor, Darius the Great, they unfortunately then run into some serious problems during the reign of Darius's son Xerxes. There's a crazy dude who hates Jews who gains power in the court of Xerxes and he convinces the king to let him right-need it in the king's name to kill all the Jews, all of them. And it is only by the providence of God and the bravery and shrewdness of these two family members Mordecai and Esther who's a secret Jew whose queen of the Persian empire to Xerxes. It's only by their shrewdness that they're able to out maneuver and outfox Haman, this evil dude who wants to kill the Jews and save the Jewish people. So like I said, it's going pretty well, but still not great. I mean, the Jews were the hares with from still getting slaughtered and annihilated completely during this comparatively much more friendly Persian age. All of that happens in the 480s and 470s, the stuff about Esther. Well, we fast forward a little ways further and what we find out is that Jerusalem still isn't back on its feet even as we make it all the way to the reign of Xerxes son, Artaxerxes. Jerusalem is still in peril. It's still in danger. Yeah, they got a temple up, but they're all kinds of enemies who've gathered around it. It's a long way from the influence of the throne. It's Jerusalem and its well-being is not exactly a high priority for the king of kings. It's the king of Persia. And so we discover that there's still great peril and that everything could still easily and quickly go sideways because Jerusalem is unprotected. It has no walls. It's not a finished product. And the people there are also not a finished product. They haven't regained their identity. They haven't regained their connectedness with God. They're listless. They're directionless. And a group like that isn't going to last very long under the political and social circumstances that we read about during this era of Persian history. And so what we get in Ezra and Nehemiah are the stories of two really important people, Ezra and Nehemiah, who play really important roles in trying to avert this crisis and solve this problem that I just laid out that exists in Jerusalem and amongst the exiles who have returned from exile to Jerusalem and who are trying to figure out how to be a people again and how to be a people with a relationship with God again. And so narratively, Ezra tackles a lot of the question of how the temple is going to be rebuilt. But then we fast forward a bunch of time and Nehemiah is going to tackle the question of how are we going to protect it? How are we going to solidify the deal and lock this thing in? And so in the same way that I had to stand on that hillside and Nero's garden and just take a minute to orient myself and try to wrap my brain around this wild confluence of events that led us to that one surreal moment. So we got some time. We're going to take a few days to try to set this all up and understand as best as we can all of the confluence of events and story and culture and history that add up to this moment in Nehemiah. And I feel like we are off to a really good start. Thank you so much for being here. Thanks for hanging out with me more on this tomorrow. I'm Matt. I'm in a Bible Hour podcast.
