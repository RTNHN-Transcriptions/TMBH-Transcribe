Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one is about Jeremiah. You remember how yesterday we were looking at the book of Isaiah, and you kind of come away feeling like, alright, there's some pretty stiff judgment in there, but the balance of it is hope and optimism that goes far beyond the circumstances that are immediately in view. You remember that, right? It's kind of fun, hopeful. Today we're talking about Jeremiah, and just invert all of that ratio. Here there's a glimmer of hope, but more so what we're going to see is a whole lot of judgment. We're going to see one guy, Jeremiah, well, and his helper is scribe Baruch, who supports him and chronicles all of this stuff, pushing back against this tidal wave of foolishness and immorality and hostility from the people of Judah toward their God. You got one guy who is pleading with them not to continue on the course they're continuing on, but when it becomes clear that that's what they're going to do, this one guy is also bold enough to proclaim on behalf of God. There is judgment coming, and it is going to hurt a lot. So Jeremiah is riding toward the very end in the closing years of the Kingdom of Judah. That's the southern kingdom, the one that outlasted the northern kingdom, which you'll recall got defeated by Assyria, but during the lifetime of Jeremiah, Assyria fades into the background and a new threat arises. This is Babylon. While Babylon might not have been quite as vile as the Assyrians, they're bigger, they're more powerful, and they are just as bent on conquest. Some of the prophets we read about in the Old Testament, we get a pretty good accounting of what the terms of their being called to be a prophet were all about. Others all we get is they were a prophet, and then they got to work, and here's what they had to say. With Jeremiah, we get a pretty decent amount of biographical material, and the book of Jeremiah looks like it's a compilation of a whole lot of different styles of literature, of different things that Jeremiah wrote himself about his own life, and recordings of Jeremiah's prophecies, but it also looks like parts of Jeremiah were maybe written by, or at least compiled by this Baruch character who helped him out. There's some pretty high drama and a lot of accounting of the persecution and difficulties Jeremiah goes through as he's continually there as a burr under the saddle of the kings he speaks to, and the culture he's speaking to, nobody really likes what he has to say because it is so withering and so loaded with a terrifying judgment. It's one of those deals where when things go off the rails as badly as they've gone in Jeremiah's context, and he says the thing that is true, even if people know it's true at that point, they're so married to the destructive stuff that got them where they are that it takes a very exceptional person to admit it and repent and acknowledge that this truth teller is actually telling the truth historically, even in a non-religious setting, when the writing is on the wall that a culture is headed for collapse, you generally have this period right before then where everybody is in denial and trying to get everything out of it they can, and they are very angry at people who are pointing out what really is very obvious when you look back at it with the benefit of history that that particular culture's goose was cooked and that their fate was already sealed, it was just a matter of time until that actually played out. So that is the moment in the lifestyle of a kingdom, a people group, a culture that Jeremiah's writing into that he's speaking into, and it's just not a lot of fun, it's not going to make him a popular character. And so in the early going here, the most basic message of Jeremiah is there was a covenant between you, God's chosen people and God, and you have not held up your end of the bargain, and God is now going to hold up his end of that conditional bargain, which means you are going to receive judgment and it's going to hurt. And chief among the examples that Jeremiah points to is the fact that God's chosen people are cheating on him, they go and worship in this beautiful temple that Solomon made and that was dedicated to him and his spirit, and he lives in that temple, but then God's chosen people walk right outside the walls of that temple where they've offered sacrifices, then where the smoke that indicates the presence of God had arrived to dwell with them and fill the air with another kind of smoke, that which occurs when God's chosen people then consigned their own offspring to the flames as an offering, a sacrifice to the detestable Canaanite gods. Yeah, maybe Jeremiah would seem a little too harsh if it weren't for examples like that, scattered throughout the book where you're like, oh my goodness, this isn't just a little religious dispute. He isn't just like, you guys, come on, like my politics better. Come on, guys, come on, let's be nicer. Come on. Now he's talking about something that is fundamentally 100% entirely wickedly evil backwards from what things are supposed to look like for these people in their relationship with God and in honoring the law of God. He goes on to use the imagery of drinking from a cup of judgment, and that cup of judgment is reflected in the power of Babylon. That's going to be God's chosen instrument. The attentive reader to the Gospels will note that Jesus talks about this cup and how the disciples, they weren't ready to drink from this cup, and they're like, no, no, totally we are. Then in that case, the cup is representative of judgment that is intended for others and justly given to others by God, but that is instead poured out upon the servant, poured out upon Christ. Obviously we'll get to that when we get more to the New Testament stuff. As bleak as this all sounds right in the middle of Jeremiah, once again, though, we get language about this coming Messiah, this one who is going to straighten all of this stuff out. The language makes it clear that this straightening out is going to go well beyond a political solution to the mess that God's chosen people have created for themselves, and so as we get into the middle and toward the end of the book, Jeremiah assumes this posture of terrifying chill about all the ugly stuff that is to come. After pronouncing judgment, he calmly explains that this is inevitable, this is going to happen, Babylon is coming, and then he even spells out for them how this judgment is part of God's redemptive plan and tells these future exiles how to live after they get taken, and that's where we get that famous Jeremiah 2911 passage that people often get tattooed on themselves or stencil on the walls of their living rooms, where it famously says, for I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans for welfare and not for evil to give you a future and a hope. That well-known promise comes immediately on the heels of this. For thus says the Lord, when 70 years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place. And then you get the famous words about plans to prosper you and not to harm you, and then it says, then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. And so there's this calm, rational, tender reassurance, almost like a dad, look, I know, not everybody spanks their kids. I got no judgment for that one way or the other. I got spankings when I was a kid, and my calm, rational dad, who was pretty gentle with those spankings when I was little, would sit there with his hand on my butt and he'd be like, son, I love you. Here's exactly what's going to happen. Here's why this is not going to be as hard as I can spank. Here's what you're going to take from this. Here's what's going to happen as soon as we're done with this spanking. And I remember the emotion of that, which was both terror, but also real genuine reassurance of my father's love and clarity on why this was occurring and what I was to take from it. That feels like the tone we're getting right here, even if the example I chose to liken it to might offend a few modern sensibilities. Well, then the last chunk of the book, it flips around and less anybody would be like, well, I guess God also really must like the Babylonians in favor of them. There must be something good about them that we should probably imitate. Nope, nope, nope. Now we get a declaration of judgment against Babylon from Jeremiah, making it clear that Babylon is nothing more than the clumsy, stupid instrument that is deftly wielded in the hands of God to bring about this judgment, but there will also be a judgment against Babylon that is coming. And of course that judgment turns out to come in the form of another nation that God wields deftly, that being the Persian Empire under Cyrus, the great who we've talked about a whole bunch. The book wraps up almost blow for blow with the events of the end of Second Kings, with the failures of the last kings of Judah of the south and the arrival of Nebuchadnezzar and the exile. So within the book of Jeremiah itself, it's not like it's just hanging out there. Like, did it work out? Was Jeremiah right? No, no, within the book of Jeremiah itself, it's made clear. It was right, and Jeremiah, even though he heard from God and was speaking truth to this, he suffers the consequences of the exile as well. His own eyes have to suffer the horror of what happened at that time at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians. But then in the final, final little epilogue, little tag at the end of Jeremiah, we see the same thing that we get in the final, final little epilogue tag at the end of Second Kings. And that is that a future king of Babylon, often exile. Remembers a descendant of David, a man who would be king if there was still a kingdom, if there was still Judah, a man named Jehoiachine. And this Babylonian king is like, you know what? You come on out of prison and dine at my table. And that's where it wraps up with this little hint, this little glimmer, this little reminder that God said his promises were still on. Isaiah used the imagery of that cut down tree, that stump of Jesse all burned out, but then a little surprise shoot comes up out of it. And that's where we're going to get our servant. That's where we're going to get our Messiah. That's where the hope comes from. Jeremiah is reiterating the same point here, but he's doing it with the same imagery. That is of this dining scene with the king of Babylon and Jehoiachine, the follow suit from what we get at the end of Second Kings. On the whole, Jeremiah is pretty bleak. There's no getting around it, but the circumstances he was writing to are pretty bleak. I feel bad for this guy. There's a lot of people in the Bible who got roped into some pretty difficult tasks. I'm not sure there are many though that can rival the difficulty of what Jeremiah got called into. When you visualize Jeremiah, picture a whole gigantic crowd of people representing everybody in a culture who doesn't want to hear it, and then picture one guy facing them all and speaking difficult truths directly to them. When you think about the theme, think about Jeremiah's proclamation that God's chosen people violated the covenant and that judgment was coming, but that the Messiah was still coming as well. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, go check out Jeremiah 29 through 33, which will get you a whole bunch of that promise for restoration and the stuff about the Messiah. Achievement unlocked. We got Jeremiah and tomorrow we'll try and tackle lamentations. All right. And Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
