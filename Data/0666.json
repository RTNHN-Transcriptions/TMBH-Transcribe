This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast and today we're going to start with an exercise and it's going to be a fun exercise, even if you're not into baseball or movies. Trust me, this is all going to work out. Okay, baseball first, I am going to give you some key statistics from an anonymous baseball player from the last 50 years. And then if you're any kind of baseball fan at all, I just want you to shriek out names of players you think this stat line might be associated with. And I'm going to tell you who it actually was ready. 2200 hits. Well, north of that, north of 300 home runs, 312 batting average, 933 OPS, two batting titles, Hall of Fame. Who are we talking about? Some of you are probably shrieking chipper Jones, Manny Ramirez, George Brett, Cal Ripken Jr, Wade Boggs, Johnny Bench, Reggie Jackson, Mike Piazza. Well, you're all wrong. And you should feel terrible. Well, you're not wrong. I did hear that. You right there who was yelling Edgar Martinez. You were absolutely right. That's who it is. Edgar Martinez. He's an oft overlooked baseball player with a beautiful stat line who just didn't get the press of some of these other more famous names underrated. Okay, the switch gears, people don't like baseball and do movies ready. Who is the single highest grossing actor of all time? I mean, lead actor supporting role, voice acting cameo, anything who's the highest grossing actor of all time and just shriek that out wherever you are preferably at someone. If there's anyone near you. Okay, some of you are yelling Tom Hanks. And that is a very good guess. Tom Hanks is on the list. But no, some of you going with another Tom right now, Tom Cruise. Yes, I hear that right there. It's not Tom Cruise, but it's a good guess. Scarlett Johansson. She's been in a ton of stuff. It's not her. Some of you are thinking Samuel L Jackson. Yeah, he is often considered there are some metrics by which you can count him as the highest grossing actor of all time, but not by the total overall metric. I just threw out good guests though. Will Smith. Yeah, summer blockbuster a year for like 20 years. Mm hmm. The Wild Wild West happened. Let's not forget that. But no, it's not him. Dwayne Johnson. Yep. He's got a bunch too, but it's not him either. No, indeed the highest grossing actor of all time is Stanley. Isn't that weird? Don't get me wrong. Everybody knows is Stanley is not underrated as a human. And he was a guy responsible for so much of what happened with Marvel comics and so many of the characters and modern myths that everybody knows about today. I mean, he was a gigantic deal, but all of those cameos and all of those movies really added up surprise. Underrated actor Stanley, who would have thought every now and then things just get so much press and get repeated so often that we create in our mind this pecking order, this illusion of what is the most important? What is the most influential? What's the biggest deal? And sometimes when you actually go and look at reality, it doesn't square as neatly as perception. So let's do one more underrated overrated thing. Here's the last question. What two profits in the Old Testament predicted more about the Messiah than anybody else? Okay, you're probably getting Isaiah because his book is just huge. He cheated. He just wrote so very, very much. I mean, it's just bound to be in there. And the second one, maybe you remember from us talking about this a while back? Maybe you're doing the math and triangulating because we're looking at a prophecy from Zechariah right now in Matthew 26 31. But it's Zechariah, one of those Old Testament prophets that for a long time, you probably just didn't even remember actually existed because it fits in there with all those minor prophets and their names all kind of sound the same. And it's hard to remember what order they go in. But Zechariah is all over the book of Matthew, not just even in terms of specific direct illusions to what the Messiah would be, but also in terms of motif and story, the whole structure of the book of Zechariah points to this grand arc of redemptive history and even how God's own people at times are the ones who are thwarting or you can't work out resisting what God is doing in this grand redemptive plan. It parallels so very neatly the stuff that's going on with the religious leadership's failures that we've seen throughout the book of Matthew. And indeed, maybe Jesus even references him by name. And if you go all the way back and listen to episodes 5 44 45 and 5 46, we talked about this super in depth, but it's back in Matthew chapter 23 right at the end where Jesus is critiquing the religious leadership. Remember, he wraps that up saying you snakes, you brood of vipers. Again, this is Jesus talking to the religious leadership after giving them seven woes. How will you escape being condemned to hell? It's harsh. Therefore, I'm sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you'll kill and crucify others. You'll flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth from the blood of the righteous able to the blood of Zechariah son of Barakiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. I tell you the truth, all this will come upon this generation. Now, I'm not going to revisit the textual controversy that exists here. If you want that specifically, I cover it in episode 5 46, but to put it simply here, Jesus may be talking about the Zechariah who is referenced so often throughout the book of Matthew, or he may be talking about a different Zechariah, or he may be rolling together intentionally two stories about two different people named Zechariah to illustrate a larger point. And there are a ton of Zechariah is in the Bible, like 30 something. I thought maybe I wrote that down somewhere. But I don't remember the exact number. It's a lot. And so I say maybe Jesus is referencing this wildly underrated prophet Zechariah right here in the same way that he directly references Daniel a chapter two chapters later in the Olivet Discourse. Okay, quick details to refresh our memories. Zechariah, the prophet who talked about the Messiah so much and who is being quoted in Matthew 26 31. And when it says Jesus told them this very night, you will all fall away on account of me for it is written quote, I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. The Zechariah who predicted that stuff about jeep and shepherd and the striking and all of that business was a sixth century BC prophet who would have been a contemporary of Daniel. He would have been alive when Cyrus the great toppled Babylon in 539 on behalf of the Persians. Well, I guess he kind of was the Persians and Zechariah was also a contemporary of some of the successors to Cyrus, which means that Zechariah was also alive during the time of the prophet Haggai. And both of these guys were writing to the situation back in Jerusalem where Cyrus the great the Persian had let the captives go free from Babylon who is now conquered and defeated the land of Nebuchadnezzar. He lets the Jews go free to go back and rebuild and even have a significant degree of self governance. But they're a little bulky. Some people want to stay home. Some people prioritize getting their houses all fixed up in a way that the prophets don't like when they do get back to Jerusalem. Building stalls out on the reconstruction or the building of the new temple because the old one got wrecked and torn down during the conquest of Nebuchadnezzar. And so Zechariah's book involves a whole lot of calling out the leadership and the people who went back for just not being faithful, not getting done what they were supposed to get done. And all of this is prompted with this dialogue, this exchange that is happening with this angel of the Lord and some visions that come out of that. And if you want to understand a prophet and you kind of want to cheat to get that done, you can usually just read the very beginning. It'll give you an idea. So here's the first little chunk of Zechariah kind of sets up some of the stuff that we're already talking about. Here we go. In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Barakiah, the son of Edo. The Lord is very angry with your forefathers. Therefore, tell the people, this is what the Lord Almighty says, return to me declares the Lord Almighty. And I'll return to you says the Lord Almighty. Don't be like your forefathers to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed, this is what the Lord Almighty says, turn from your evil ways and your evil practices, but they would not listen or pay attention to me declares the Lord. Where are your forefathers now and the prophets? Do they live forever? But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants, the prophets overtake your forefathers, then they repented and said the Lord Almighty is done to us what our ways and practices deserve just as he determined to do. So it opens with this reminder of like, hey, God's been talking to you about his intentions, his redemptive plan to use our language. And those words of the Lord have persisted. And not only did you and your ancestors not listen to the people who God sent to tell you about what his intentions were, you mistreated them. And then the word of the Lord, according to Zechariah in the opening chapter of this book indicates that like the cycle continues, like eventually you all figured it out, but it was a rough deal. We've got a ton more to do in terms of thinking about the underrated prophet Zechariah and looking at some of the guts of what he wrote, big picture, and more specifically the point to the Messiah. And so I think we're going to take a couple of days to chip away at this one. I just wanted to say thanks again for all of you who've taken the time in any various format to send thoughts and just encouragement feedback interaction with the program. I do get a lot of that. I'm not always able to respond in exactly the way or the frequency or the rapidity that I would like to. But I do see everything. And it means so much. Thank you. I also read all your reviews. And there was one that I saw from just the other day here that really caught my attention from somebody who goes by love Kelly's. And I just reading it. I'm like, Oh, cool. Yeah, they they listened to the thing and they caught up. But then I got to this line. I started investigating the Bible after the loss of my daughter to a car accident. Hey, I don't know who you are. I lost my kid brother to a car accident when I was a young man. It was an absolutely life changing thing. And I watched my parents go through the loss of a child. And that made an impression on me. And I just got a real soft spot for what you've been going through this last year, whoever you are. And I'm sorry for how that feels. I'm sorry for what that does to the rhythm of your year and that at first year, you just got all these things that happened for the first time without that person who you love. I know that everybody else kind of has to move on a little bit because they got to live and they got to do things. And you face a lot of those first year, first time without them things a little bit more by yourself. And it's tough. I appreciated the note, but also I don't have a way to respond to to a review on iTunes. So this is my response. My heart hurts for you. I'm sorry for that loss. And it means a lot to hear that in some teeny tiny little way us hanging out and thinking about the Bible together could be helpful in that really tricky first year after something like what you've gone through. Okay, that got a little bit weighty. I think that's all right, though. More on Zechariah and his relationship to Matthew tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible, I will podcast.
