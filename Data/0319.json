This is the 10-minute Bible Hour podcast. And yesterday we were talking about Jesus going to his hometown. And instead of getting this wonderful homecoming where everybody's excited to see him and catch up on what's been going on and all the news they've heard about him, and said they were like, I will see. And then he started teaching and they're like, yeah, I got to admit, it's pretty good. And they're like, wait, where did he get all this stuff? I don't know. I'm skeptical. And then pretty soon they were just offended and out. And that's it. And the whole thing just spirals. But yesterday we left off at the end of looking at this continuum of rejection, maybe a better way to put it with this downward spiral toward rejection of Jesus. And there's this little bonus bit here at the end says, but Jesus said to them, and that's really interesting because in my Bible, but Jesus said to them is in red letters, but why would Jesus say, but Jesus said to them, I think I found a Bible typo. Whoa, like my whole world just imploded. No, I really do think that's a Bible type. Okay, that should be in black. And then in quotes, we got Jesus saying only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor. And that's Matthew 1357. And then 58 says, and he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith. So here's a riddle for today. What does it mean that he couldn't do miracles? Does that mean that his power was somehow sapped? It raises the question, is this scenario with Jesus supernatural powers? It's like a Neil Gaiman, American gods kind of thing. And if you're not familiar with that book, here's a quick rundown on the plot. You got these old gods from the old world that are super ancient. And now they're in America manifesting in the form of people holding down jobs, skulking about doing whatever. And then you got these new American gods, like technology, the internet, TV, airplane travel, and the new gods of America are choking out the old gods as the old gods get weaker, because fewer and fewer people believe in them. So the premise that underlies this whole story that a lot of people have read, and I think it's a pretty good book, is that the effectiveness of a deity is contingent on how many people believe in that deity and how fervently they believe in that deity. And that's not a concept that is entirely divorced from recent evangelical ish Christian thought. There's a series of books that I was called this present darkness, Paredi Frank Paredi was the author's name. And I read these things when I was a kid and yeah, they were fine. I'm not going to pick a fight with that guy. He's written good books and people like him. And I think he knew he was right in fiction. But he came to the same conclusion or operated from the same premise as Neil Gaiman did. And the idea here is that some of the supernatural forces, angels and demons were fueled by the belief or lack thereof of the people they were interacting with the prayer or lack thereof. And I don't think that's entirely defensible biblically. I don't know, you got that one place in Daniel chapter 10 with that confusing passage where Daniel was praying and then angel got delayed for 21 days because he had to battle with the prince of the kingdoms of Persia. It's pretty ambiguous in terms of what exactly happened there spiritually according to the text. And so some people are going to latch on to those pretty vague references here and there in the Bible. I think that Daniel 10 one is probably the most significant one. And so there are going to be people who look at those vague references to the ground rules of the supernatural and the unseen world and the spiritual that are hinted at in the Bible. And they're going to imagine that the way it works is there are these power meters, Street Fighter II style above the good guy, angels and the bad guy demons and these forces have their power meter filled up or depleted as you pound the B button again and again and again, which is the equivalent I guess of prayer or or belief. And so maybe you could extrapolate that out and you could get to Matthew 13, you could be like, Oh, well, Jesus didn't do many miracles for the same reason that that angel in that vaguely described situation in Daniel 10 couldn't answer the prayer or respond or get there quicker. And it's just because there was more spiritual force of darkness and there wasn't enough fervent enough prayer or belief or something. And so I guess then the conclusion would be that if Jesus doesn't have your belief and prayer support, much like the gods of your in American gods and that power meter is depleted and Jesus is all tired, maybe he tries to do some miracles and he raises his tired hand desperately up to shoulder height, then he's sweating and maybe his nose starts to bleed a little bit and he twitches like an exhausted Jedi trying to muster the last bit of force power and it only kind of works. He's like, forget it, I just can't do many miracles here because of your lack of faith. But that really is a very recent formula, more associated with the heavy emphasis on miracles, almost more charismatic, Pentecostal end of the theological spectrum. And I'm talking about all this because I think it's a really easy and very natural assumption to read into the text that Jesus didn't perform miracles because of some lack of ability or weakness on his part. But that has implications. Now, doesn't it? You look at the rest of the New Testament, you look at the rest of the Bible and you get this language about like all things being held together in him with God. Nothing is impossible. Oh, what is that? That's just a couple chapters away. That's Matthew 19, right? 18, I don't know, something like that. I think it's Matthew 19. Job toward the end of the book, this would be in the late 30s, early 40s chapters of Job, he says that stuff about how no purpose of God can be defeated. He can accomplish whatever he wants. And then right at the very beginning of Hebrews, Hebrews, one, two, one, three, one, four, somewhere in there, there's that phrase about how Jesus is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his nature and he upholds all things by his word. It's something like that. I could have just looked it up. You can look at it. It's Hebrews one, something he's something right there at the beginning. So I'm not even that good at this. And I can conjure this stuff up the top of my head in terms of what the Bible says about the unlimited power of God, about how God is to use the fancy term omnipotent. If there is a power that can limit God, this would not be a very good God in whom to put our trust and hope. So both reason and the text dictate that if we're really talking about the one true God, that being who's greater than any other being which can be imagined, then we are talking about a God who is not bound by any limit of power. Therefore, while I mean, notice, respect and only friendly high fiviness to anyone who might look at this and say, Oh, Jesus couldn't do miracles in Nazareth because his spiritual power was depleted and he couldn't do miracles for people who didn't believe enough. I would respectfully say, it seems more like pop notions of how the spiritual world works that have come into vogue only very recently. And more likely the scenario that we're talking about here is, yeah, I just, I couldn't do that like declining a deal. Like, of course, I could pay the $5,000 for that used car that we're dickering over. But I couldn't do that. It doesn't mean I don't have $5,001 in my bank account. It means I'm not going to do that. I'm electing not to do that strategically. This doesn't make sense. This isn't where I want to put my resources. This isn't what I'm going to do. I couldn't do that deal. That is the way I read this text admittedly in its immediate context, probably the more natural read, at least in the new international version that I'm looking at here, would be that his power was limited by their lack of faith. If we spread that context out, even a chapter or two in either direction, then we got to do the thing where we interpret the less clear that's this passage in light of the more clear, the larger amount of testimony on the subject. And that larger amount indicates that Jesus can do it every day. Well, please visit if he wants to do miraculous stuff. He can if he wants to calm the seas, even though the people in the boat don't really totally believe he can do that. And they're in awe when he actually does Jesus didn't get up in that boat and be like, Oh, this storm's really bad guys. I need you to believe harder. Come on, a little bit harder. I can almost stop the storm with your belief power, but I need just a little bit more. That sounds like some hype man trying to get people riled up in an auditorium is just fake and lame. And I don't think that's how it works. And I think the larger context demonstrates that the Bible, at least whether you believe it or not is holding Jesus out as being fully participatory as the maker and sustainer of all things as being God in the flesh, as being unlimited in power, and that no human could really dictate anything to God could dictate anything to Jesus. Jesus does have his strategy and his way that he is approaching it to best accomplish the redemptive purposes of God in all of this stuff. But to suggest that somehow me not being totally convinced Jesus is the real deal would cause him to feel diminishment and power. That's not what I'm seeing here. Rather, what I see as a tag that just says, there's the further tragedy of the thing. These people deprived themselves of the most amazing human encounter that anybody in the history of ever has ever had the opportunity to experience. This tiny little window where the king is here setting up this kingdom and inviting people to it. And they're like, Now I'm offended. I'm out. I'm going to skip it. Well, that's really, really sad. And I think that's the takeaway that we're supposed to bring with us as we get to the end of chapter 13. The real thing here is that I wanted to ask a quick favor of you. I wondered if you'd be willing to go over to the TMBH.com. There's a little pop up window that happens there on the main page and it invites you to join my new email list. The reason I want that email list to exist is because the sands of the internet are shifting. And I am wanting to build something that is shifting sand proof in terms of our ability to stay connected. I said it upside if you want something out of the little TMBH shop over there, including the new likewise TMBH podcast shirt that just got put up there. If you want that, if you sign up for the email list thing, it's I think you get like 20% off and shout out. That sounds pretty good to me. So whatever the case, I'm trying to build out that email list. It's a big encouragement and help to me to drop your email in there. Obviously, I'm going to try not to do stupid things with it because I am an email user as well. And nobody wants stupid things happening in their email. So try to make it useful and fun. And again, yeah, 20% off. You want like a shirt or something. That's cool. All right. I think I don't promise, but I think we're into chapter 14 tomorrow. Thanks for investing your time in this thing with me. Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
