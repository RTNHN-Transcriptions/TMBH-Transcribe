I just watched a 15 second video of a guy swinging at 3 softball pitches. He's out practicing, he's on a football field, looks like he's standing maybe in one end zone, and he's hitting to the opposite corner of the opposite end zones. He's probably hitting 350 to 400 without any effort. The guy just has this perfect kinetic chain. He shifts his weight and in fairness, there is a lot to shift. He's a big dude. But these balls are exploding off the bat in a way that defies physics. It makes it sounds like a cannon is being fired at this football field. And then the ball goes up and sustains altitude in a way that should not be possible. It's mesmerizing. And I'm going to link to it, or I've definitely to it, in the description, you can go see it for yourself. But the craziest thing about it is it doesn't look like he's doing anything. It's so casual and so chill. But you know that guy didn't pick up a bat five seconds before he started swinging. There's a whole story behind that. There's a whole lifetime of playing sports and becoming coordinated and big and strong and all of that. And that's, you know, and you actually see it in action. You see the amazing thing occur. That's why it looks so casual because at that point it's a lot easier because of everything that's happened before. Likewise, Nehemiah chapter 9, if you're just cruising through the Bible and you've already made it through Leviticus, some of the other hard parts and then you get to the end of the narrative section of the Old Testament, you get to Nehemiah, you're going to be really tempted to look at this and be like, Nehemiah 9. Well, yeah, the people just got together and said to the story that I just got done reading over the previous 700 ish pages. It's so casual. It's so effortless. They just stood up together and were like, here's exactly what happened. And they casually and effortlessly acknowledged their own shortcomings because how could you not? And they casually and effortlessly acknowledged and assented to God's version or another way to put it, the true version in the narrative of these previous 700 pages. So casual and it looks so casual and easy and effortless that you might just kind of thumb through it pretty quick as you're reading it and be like, Oh, I already read all of this. I know it is repetition, a really short repetition of everything I just did. Cool. Okay. Well, I guess they saw it too. But the reason it looks so casual and easy and effortless is because of the huge process that has gone on to get this generation of people who's on screen right here to finally for one little moment in all of the grand history of the Bible to see it, to get it for one instant and to admit what is reality. How did they get there? There's a failure, tons of trying things their own way and having it end catastrophically. And now tons of gratitude for getting something back that they didn't deserve to get back by all rights of the agreement they made with God. They weren't entitled to any of the blessings they now enjoy. And yet here they are. And so because of the huge 99% of the iceberg that's below the surface, the little tip of the iceberg that we get here in Nehemiah chapter nine looks so very, very easy. All the people gathered together the week before in Nehemiah 8, they all put on party clothes and made party booths and made party beverages and party food and invited their neighbors to come over and they shared and it was fun. And if anybody started crying, Ezra, Nehemiah and the Levites, they help out with temple stuff, they would come around and be like, knock it off. The time for balling, complaining, being sad and regretful about things. This is party week. So be happier and that people were like, okay, you don't have to ask us five times. We'll be happy but turn the page to chapter nine. And now they've got their sad outfits on. They got dirt rubbed on them and they're all gathered together in a totally different mood. And they have this prayer that maybe they're repeating back to Ezra and his helpers, the Levites or maybe they got something in front of them that they can read it on or maybe they memorized it. I think it's more likely they were just repeating. I think that's how culture worked at this point. And it comes off as effortless in its acknowledgement of God's goodness and their failure and in how this prayer makes for the collective ascent to the truth of the events that have happened even though they are very flattering for the people saying the prayer. Nehemiah 9, five, blessed be your glorious name and may it be exalted above all blessing and all praise picture a huge crowd of men, women and children saying this loudly together in unison picture this echoing off the freshly stacked and mortared walls that now protect them. Picture this bouncing back to them off of the walls of the temple that was dedicated a couple of generations earlier. Everything about the physical landscape, the audio environment and the vibe of the people is all something that undergirds this prayer that they are now making. You alone are the Lord. You made the heavens even the highest heavens and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything and the multitudes of heaven worship you. Now you might think, okay, well, that's just a preamble. We talked about it a few days ago. This is them saying you're God. We're not yet. It is that. But this is also them internalizing part of the Bible that has happened before this part. Now, the part of the Bible I'm referencing is actually a couple books down the road here. It's still ahead of us. You go Esther and then the next book after Esther is Job and Job is probably the oldest book in the whole Bible. It's one that the crowd would have known and what's the lesson of Job? Well, Job goes through tremendous suffering and his friends are eager to complain about God or say it must be your fault for doing something bad. Job seems to be the most noble of those quote unquote friends who try to help him grieve. But in the end, God shows up. He makes counsel with Job and he's like, all right, Job, you got a bunch of questions about my goodness and my power and who I am. Cool. Put on your little man outfit because you're going to need it for this conversation. It's great paraphrases mine, but barely paraphrases mine. And then God gives him this galactic tour of all of creation and time and space and things known to human eyes and unknown to human eyes. And Job is like, I'm an idiot. Yep. Where was I when you did all of that? You're right. I am wrong. You made everything. You were entitled to everything. I am not. And he goes from a fairly good posture before God to an absolutely right posture before God's powerful stuff. The people in Nehemiah knew that story because even though Job comes after Nehemiah chronologically as does Esther, both of those books are set in an earlier time from Nehemiah. What we're looking at here is the very end of the narrative part of the Old Testament. So they're getting that and they're repeating back to God that truth. They have stubbornly resisted that truth since forever and you can't really get on your high horse about it and get after them because people who believe there's a God since forever have gone to church and sung hymns and songs that make liars out of us all. They have words just like this, oh, bless is God. You're above everything. You're great. But our actions betray that we only sometimes think that. And so here they're trying to bend the knee and say collectively, we actually think this. We have learned the lesson of Job verse seven. You are the Lord God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham. You found his heart faithful to you and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Emmerites, parasites, Jebusites and Gurgoshites. I like that one. You have kept your promise because you are righteous. This is a huge statement of ascent. It's just a few sentences. It looks so casual. It looks so easy, so effortless. Sounds so bibaly, but it was so hard for them to get to a place where they could say that so effortlessly. This whole narrative about God choosing Abraham and guiding him to where his descendants would take up residence, a land promised to them, it is spelled out in the text. But along the way, every generation is resistant to this. Every generation is worried about their own stuff more than the stuff of God. And many generations are very, very often we get a sense of entitlement. We have this because we did this. We have this land. We have this kingdom because we made certain decisions and we did things. But counter to that throughout the whole Old Testament, we see God stacking the deck against himself, stacking the deck that is against the hoped for outcome for his chosen people to make it so that it's such a crazy long shot that things worked out that nobody could take credit for themselves as a person. Nobody could give credit to a people group, but instead the idea is anybody who looks at this is going to have to give credit to God. I'll just back my people up against a giant body of water with the most powerful military in the world bearing down on them angrily and they don't have any weapons or nothing. And how are you going to solve that one? Well, so that no person could get credit. We've made a very difficult situation here and we're going to solve it by parting the sea. Oh, that's pretty good. Well, we got to defeat these invaders. They're going to kill all of us. We could get a great big army or we could go through a series of tests about how dudes drink when they're thirsty by the water's edge to reduce the number of soldiers that we're going to win with down to nothing. We're going to go and attack the biggest fortified, most heavily fortified city, maybe in the world at this point in history, that we have to conquer if we're going to ever be able to get our own land because it's a control base. And instead of doing it with swords, we're going to do it with trumpets. We're just going to march around it with trumpets. The whole idea is that deck is constantly stacked against the positive outcome so that God can do things in remarkable ways where only he gets credit. So it might seem casual and easy and effortless for this gathering of descendants of Abraham and Nehemiah chapter nine to get together and say, you are the Lord God who chose Abraham and brought him out of war of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham. You found his heart faithful to you and you made a covenant with him. And then you gave us this land and kept all of your promises. But it wasn't easy at any other point. The narrative they always wanted to spin was we did it. We did it. We did it. And for them to finally come around to saying this is to finally admit to what really is evident when you read through the story itself, that God is the one who was making all of this go. Here's one of those examples right here. You saw the suffering of your forefathers in Egypt verse nine. You heard their cry at the Red Sea. You sent miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day. You divided the sea before them so that they passed through it on dry ground. But you hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone into mighty waters. By day you led them with a pillar of cloud and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take. It all seemed so obvious. It all seemed so easy. But isn't it always as we discussed yesterday obvious and easy what words ought to be said or how someone ought to act when it's them embroiled in their narrative. But it's real hard to do it for ourselves to bring ourselves to the place where we can say and mean the true thing, the real narrative when it's us brining in our own story with all of its dishonesty and all of the little lies that we have told to make ourselves feel better about ourselves to make it so that we can sleep at night. It's so difficult when it's you or I doing it. It doesn't feel casual and effortless and easy when you and I finally come around to saying the things that are true. But when the work has truly been done and you're truly repentant and you truly see how the things are and all of the illusions of a given age have finally exhausted themselves. Then finally, not only is it possible to say this stuff, but it's as easy as that guy on that football field smoking softballs 400 feet at a time. It just looks like nothing, but the power is there and it's very real. There's a whole lot more stuff that this assembly is going to say here in Nehemiah 9. It's going to be kind of a quick tour through the Old Testament again, which is a nice bonus perk as well. I just appreciate you all so much and I'm glad we get to do this together. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible I'm going to talk about. Let's do this again.
