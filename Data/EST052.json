It's Matt Whitman. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Today is a day of grieving because today we say goodbye to our friend Herodotus, probably not entirely. We'll dip back into some Herodotus stuff, but his account of things runs out about a year after Xerxes defeat at the Battle of Salamis. He covers the mop up duty, the defeat of Mardonius at Plataea, a couple other little details, and then a bit about the end of Xerxes life that we're going to talk about today. And then that's it. And I have heard it said that as a historian trying to understand ancient Persia and trying to sort through Herodotus's mixture of embellishment and legend and fact that he can be a very frustrating dance partner when exploring history. But also you miss him when he's gone. Because let me tell you the sources on Xerxes and art as Xerxes and the rest of the Persian stuff, they really thin out after this and they're never quite the same. And don't get me wrong, we get some samples from the rest of the era of Persia that are in bright color and we get lively characters from other pseudo historians, but they're even goofier and more reckless than Herodotus in terms of the words they ascribe to people and the situations they describe. And again, the mingling of legend and history. And so I guess I'm in the same boat as whoever said about Herodotus in the first place. I do miss him now that he's gone. But I keep saying now that he's gone. He's not quite gone. Because there is one more incident recorded at the end of the final book of the histories of Herodotus that tells us a little bit about Xerxes mental state after all of this was over. And I think it corresponds with what we get here in Esther two and verse one. This says later, when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her. So the author of Esther is describing a post failed Greek campaign Xerxes, who's maybe laying there on one of his golden couches, thinking about that party, dragging his finger through the sand, maybe even dragging it through the sand in such a way that it makes a sort of picture that kind of looks like Vashti. And how she used to be. Maybe he misses her and maybe he feels regret to getting bamboozled by everybody else and getting whipped by the Greeks. And this subtle characterization of a list list despondent, lost his moral compass, lost himself unsure of what to do next Xerxes is kind of in keeping with what we get at the end of the histories of Herodotus. So Herodotus has Xerxes leaving Salamis leaving Athens after his defeat there in the fall of 480 and making his way with whatever troops or maybe he took with him back to Sardis. You'll recall that Sardis is sort of the western capital of the Persian Empire. And Herodotus has Xerxes setting up shop and Sardis for a little while to keep tabs on how Mardonius is doing with finishing off the pesky Greeks. Well, as we talked about yesterday, Mardonius didn't end up doing very well at all. And early into the next year's campaign season, so 479, Mardonius is defeated at the Battle of Plataia and he dies. So Xerxes supervision and regional presence didn't prove to be very helpful for the Persian army or for Mardonius. Well, according to Herodotus, while Xerxes is there in Sardis, he's feeling unsettled on the whole wife front. Now again, according to Herodotus, at this point, Xerxes is already married to this Amestris character. As we've discussed, it's pretty difficult to square Vashti or Esther with this Amestris lady. We know a lot about her, we know where she's from, and we know how she handled herself. And it's certainly not like a Bible heroine. So Amestris does not cannot equal Esther. That doesn't make any sense. And she's not Jewish. So that really doesn't make any sense. And Amestris doesn't square with Vashti because she's not deposed. And she's the exact opposite of deposed. She practically rules the roost from here on out. But Xerxes isn't portrayed as sitting around in Sardis in modern day Turkey, Asia Minor and thinking fond thoughts about Amestris. Instead, he becomes obsessed with the wife of his brother. Now remember, Xerxes had brothers who were older than him, younger than him. Darius, his father had married some women before he became king. But Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, was the wife of Darius after he became king and Xerxes was the first born after Darius became king. And that of course is the convoluted claim to the throne that ended up resulting in Xerxes succeeding Darius in the late fall of 486 BC. Well, now seven years have passed. Xerxes has got probably a few wives of his own. I suppose you could say by this point, because of the debacle at the War Council party that he's effectively divorced one of his wives, though I don't think she gets to go and remarry under Persian law. And so he's sitting around in Sardis, he's lonely and he's frustrated and he feels impotent and weak because he got embarrassed. And according to Herodotus, he takes this interest in his brother's wife. So it looks like this is setting up to be Herod family from the New Testament, incest disaster kind of situation. Remember, John the Baptist called out an arrangement like this within the Herod family. And that ultimately is what landed his head on a platter at yet another one of these lavish banquets where insane things happen in the Bible. But in this situation doesn't work out that way. His sister-in-law, weird. I mean, that's who it is. It really is a sister-in-law. His sister-in-law rebuffs his messages and his ovations. She's like, no, I like my husband and I can read between the lines here. I know what's going to happen to my husband if this thing goes down between us. So no, I know you're the king of everything. You can do whatever you want, but I will pass. Xerxes frustrated. And then he's like, well, maybe I could get to her through her daughter. So he proposes a marriage between one of his own sons, Darius's sons, one of the princes and Xerxes' niece, the daughter of this couple who are prominent in Sardis. Well, according to Herodotus, the whole entourage makes their way back towards you. So we're still in 479 here. And somewhere in all of that, Xerxes quits being interested for the time being in his sister-in-law and now becomes interested in his daughter-in-law. His daughter-in-law, almost certainly because of the political pressure that Xerxes could exert on a young lady like that, the daughter-in-law goes for it. So now it's getting weird. She's with Xerxes and it's as strange a relationship as you would expect with Xerxes bestowing gifts upon her. And at Xerxes' birthday party that year, here we go again with the party in the banquet thing. Everybody's getting liquored up and real excited about stuff and kings as they are wanted to do, make big promises at those parties. Again, there's echoes of this in the account of Herod's banquet that results in John the Baptist death. He's like, well, that was a great dance. What do you want? Up to half my kingdom. I mean, what Herod was channeling there in that New Testament moment is a tradition that goes back to banquets like this, hundreds of years earlier in Persia. Well, Xerxes breaks out the same kind of, what do you want? Anything? I'll give it to you. And the girl makes such a dangerous request. There was this robe that Xerxes had been made, maybe like kind of a coat of mini colors thing from the Joseph account that shows the favor of his wife, a mistress. She was very talented and she made this marvelous mantle, Herodotus calls it. And Xerxes wore it about, but he liked to wear it when he would go and have his little flings with his daughter-in-law. And the daughter-in-law came to really like the mantle and decided that a way to stick it to Xerxes wife would be to say the thing that I want is that mantle that your wife made you. And Xerxes is like, ah, that's not going to be good. That, ah, what if I give you an army that is fully funded and it's just that your command and you can use it for wars and stuff? And she's like, no, no, I don't really want an army. I want that particular coat right there. Well, now Xerxes has made a big boast and in the same way Herod is over a barrel at the meal where the thing happened with John the Baptist. Now he's over a barrel as well. So he gives her the mantle tries to do it discreetly, but she's not going to be discreet about it. And of course, a mestris finds out about that. And she is understandably unimpressed and now Xerxes is hearing it from her and he ends up giving into pressure from a mestris who assumes that it was this girl's mom all along who caused this problem. She doesn't blame the young girl at all. She gets it. He's the king. She's mad at this girl's mom. That's the rival. So a mestris pressures Xerxes really heavily to say, I want access to her. And Xerxes knowing it probably isn't going to be for anything good. Finally, it's like, okay. And then a mestris sends the royal guard to this lady's house while Xerxes, not knowing that that's going on, is trying to negotiate something with his brother to get out of this sticky situation. He's like, okay, let me offer you some other family members that could marry some of your family members. But how about you marry my daughter? I just need you to release your wife, my sister-in-law. I can't tell you why, but there's bad stuff cooking. You just need to send her away and then you can marry my daughter. It'll strengthen our alliance. But his brother is like, but I love my wife. She's great. And I wouldn't want to do that. I would be super sad. I know you can force me, but please don't do that. As your brother, I love my wife. Xerxes, you know, what happens when you resist Xerxes. He gets real, real mad and fussy about stuff. But while all of that is going on, the royal guard at the command of a mistress has gone to their house and mutilated and maimed in ways that I will not describe, even though it's a 2,500 year old story, I still won't say it into a microphone for you here. It's horrible. The husband goes home fearing she might have been mistreated and finds his wife in this condition, grabs his son and flees to the country where he is governor with the intent of raising troops and rebelling against Xerxes. Xerxes knows what he's going to do and sends his army to chase him down and they catch him and his son on the road and they kill him. And that's really the last meaningful story we get about Xerxes from Herodotus. That's it. Everything else we know about him after that moment is from the book of Esther or from some grandizing inscriptions that don't really tell us too much one way or the other. So when you compare Esther and Herodotus in regards to what Xerxes mindset was like after the Greek campaign and in the ensuing months, Esther is actually really tame about it, implying merely that Xerxes seemed to miss Vashti. But when we read that account of Esther in light of what Herodotus tells us about this whole sister-in-law, niece, daughter-in-law, jacket, maiming, a mistress disaster, it's easier to understand why Xerxes would be looking to latch on to something that he found comfort in and security and stability and from earlier better times before this horrible war and before awful mistakes that don't get you dethroned as a king necessarily, but that certainly would isolate you even in your own palace that just a few years earlier was bustling with life and energy and laughing and enthusiasm. A sense of what we're getting here is a Xerxes who's thinking about what's gone wrong and is thinking about what he needs to do next to get things back on track and to get back to that feeling he had before everything went sideways. Little longer conversation today, but that was a pretty interesting story and I didn't want to break it up. So thank you for taking a few extra minutes with me on our goodbye journey with Herodotus and tomorrow we're on to the next chunk of Esther chapter two.
