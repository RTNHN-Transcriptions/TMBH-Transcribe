And as I've told you recently, I'm watching through the old NBC sitcom community right now. This is my second time. I don't often watch anything twice. It's kind of weird to watch this one twice, but it's been fun. This show, I'm told, was just, it was crazy. It was a wild Petri dish in terms of the set and the cast and the writers and people who didn't want to be there and big personalities. And it all added up to a show that is just bizarre. It does weird stuff comedically. And in terms of satire, their entire seasons that they just completely whiff on, but on balance. I mean, the show is some of the best comedy writing and best comedy performances I've ever seen ever. It's great. None of the characters are particularly likable. And one of the unlikable characters in this show is a girl named Britta Perry. And Britta is an activist. She cares very much about things very far away from her. And whenever it seems like people are in her circle of friends are having too much fun, she gives them a lecture about things they should be aware of far, far away. Their kids in Guatemala who are literally on fire and you're here playing a game. It's like that kind of chastisy icky tone. And she's a buzzkill and everybody even on the show says she's just the worst and she is the worst on the show. But it's funny. I mean, it's all, you know, it's tongue in cheek. You know what they're doing. They know what they're lampooning with this character who cares so much about things far away that don't affect her at all. And people she'll never meet and that she doesn't really know anything about her understand. She cares so much about that that it interferes with her ability to be emotionally present and be a good friend to the people who are right in front of her. Likewise, we're looking at a passage in the book of Galatians that deals with that topic. The question of what you should care about the most or how you should prioritize the energy you have to give in terms of good works and attentiveness and love and compassion. And this passage in Galatians six seems to indicate that for Paul's audience, the Galatian Christians, and I suppose any Christian who is reading this letter that Paul wrote after the fact that there is supposed to be some sort of hierarchy of priorities. If you push comes a shove, who you go most out of your way to do good for as we discussed yesterday, that kind of flies in the face of modern sensibilities about keeping everything fair and doing the same amount of niceness for everybody all the time. But as Britta Perry in community demonstrates very comedically, that doesn't actually work. And it often is more performative than it is actually effective when we try to live that way. Here's the passage we're talking about. Galatians six verse 10. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. Now you might think, well, maybe this is just kind of a one off thing. That's the only time you ever said something like that. But would I really be setting it up this way? If that was the only time you ever said something like that, no, we're not going to do a whole Bible marathon today where we go and look at a whole bunch of things like this. But let me give you one more. This is Paul coaching up his protege Timothy in the New Testament book, first Timothy, and he's given him some coaching on what the expectation should be in the Christian community. And he's talking here about how widows should be treated in the church context. And in the context, talking about that, he says, give the people these instructions too so that no one may be open to blame. If anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family, he's denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. Dang, Paul, he can really go through the front door sometimes. And there is obviously anytime we come across verse like that, there's a lot of context and things that we should probably go look at. And maybe someday we'll get to first Timothy and we'll break it all down very carefully. But let's just take this at face value. Paul is doubling down here and from between relations and first Timothy on the idea that there should be a hierarchy of charity, a hierarchy of good works, a hierarchy of love in the mind of the Christian and the way Paul talks about it in the mind of any sane person. Britta Perry comes off as bordering on not sane because of how preoccupied she is with looking for things or rumors of things or news stories from far, far away that she could know about that other people haven't heard about yet that would give her the opportunity to demonstrate how good and virtuous she is while again, neglecting those around her. Paul thinks that's a stupid way to live. He doesn't necessarily call it performative. I think that's maybe a bit of a more recent psychological cultural issue that we contend with. But he is even more condemning even that he calls it wicked. Are you kidding me? How a Christian can't live like that. It's a wrong fruit to use Galatians language and apply it to what he's saying to Timothy over there in first Timothy chapter five. It's acts of the flesh kind of thinking to not love your own family. I mean, for crying out loud, the 10 commandments. Now, honor your mother and your father. There's a special priority. It makes the top 10 list. You got God is in there. And then you got family. You got mom and dad. So there are even baked into the 10 commandments. There's this idea of, like, come on, folks, let's use some sanity here to think about the circumstances around us. God commands us and calls us to love and to demonstrate these kingdom virtues to the people around us, but to the people around us, there are people right in front of us in our lives and there are people who should be afforded a certain type of honor because of the unique relationship that we have. And indeed, the early Christians latched onto this and early Christian writing indicates that this was not a big question for them. Either everybody understood. Of course, we need to do good to the people around us. Obviously, we should do good to everyone. Obviously, if we're persecuted or struggle, it shouldn't be because we were murderers or because we went around stirring up trouble or being gossips or idiots or thieves or something. People don't like the, we believe in Jesus and they get after us. Okay, that's all right. But no, we should do good in our community. I mean, when Jeremiah passes along the message from God to the exiles who are being taken away, what does he tell them? And famously, in Jeremiah 29, he tells them, like, go to the city, live well there. You're supposed to be a blessing to the people around you, but also Jeremiah and the prophets to follow in the Old Testament. They never lose sight of the priority of the people of God. They look out for each other, take care of each other. There is an Old Testament and New Testament principle, an emphasis on taking care of your brothers and sisters first, literally, and in the family of faith. And the early Christians latched onto this a pretty famous early Christian, maybe the most famous, the most influential theologian outside of the biblical authors and the characters in the New Testament in the first 500 years as a Guston. He's a guy from North Africa who lived real naughty as a kid, and his mom, Monica, kept praying for him anyways. Like Santa Monica, like Santa Monica Boulevard. That's named after a Guston's mom. Monica prayed for him real hard and he has this dramatic conversion experience. He's tutored under Ambrose of Milan, and he grows up into this amazing theologian who's on the scene during times of great crisis and groundbreaking tension in the church. And God uses him as a steadying force to keep things together. And one of the things that a Guston had to sort through during this time of tension and questions about how does the church world relate to a larger secular world if we want to use that term. He wrote a couple books about it. I mean, the big one is called The City of God. And in this, he wrestled through the same question. What is the order of operations here? What is the order of love and quite literally in Latin? That is the name of this bit of Christian thought, this Christian principle, Christian theology, it's the order of Amorous and a Guston's argument is that the God is sovereign over everything. Then he puts people in your life. He gave you a family. He brings relationships in and out of your life and you should prioritize the people who are in your life. I mean, I guess the more recent expression of this Augustinian principle of order Amorous is bloom where you're planted. That sounds like a quaint Christian book that probably existed recently. I'm not totally sure, but I recall that phrase, but the principle certainly applies. You live somewhere. You are a part of something and it might not be the big city and the bright lights and all of the big high profile things with a bunch of clicks and likes and followers and subscribers and a whole bunch of people lining up for book signings or whatever. You imagine big important Christian stuff looks like it might not be a mega church. It might not be a big giant, great big movement or whatever, but God who is sovereign has positioned all of his children, his sons, his daughters, his agents, his heirs in the places where they are with great intentionality and the expectation, Old Testament, New Testament throughout the history of the church is that Christians would do good to everybody and that Christians in particular would be very attentive to the needs of the people outside the church who are right there next to them, placed in their lives by God and particularly that they would serve each other in the church because the church, it's like this counter institution that runs right beneath the surface of all of the institutions that we think of as being big and powerful that are funded by taxes and the forces of the marketplace and that gathers money under threat of imprisonment or at the tip of the sword. These institutions have a way they do things. They have a way that they keep power. They have a way that they accomplish what they need to accomplish and sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not so good and easily abused. The church, the visible kingdom, the family of God in this world, it's different. It's built different. It's funded different. It thinks different. It operates differently. It's doing upside down stuff. It's doing kingdom value stuff and that kingdom value stuff isn't always going to make sense on paper in terms of the metrics that the world uses. And in order for that to work, Christians have to commit to it. Christians can't bite and devour each other. Gossip about each other. Christians can't be all divided over everything all the time. Christians can't go and engage in all of the stupid stuff that maybe makes sense with the game the world is playing in a world kingdom system. They're going to stand back to back. They're going to be together thick and thin. There's got to be a system for what you do when you get mad at each other and when you get sideways, you can't just give up on it. You've got to find a way to figure it out. Here's forgiveness. That's a mechanism that is a superpower to make it so that you can stay together and you can do good to each other. Now you can serve each other and you actually can be a family together. So yeah, as the Bible saying that special concern, extra priority, highest priority should be given to those who belong to the family of believers. Yes, it is. Says it in Galatians, says it all over the Old Testament, says it all over the New Testament. It says it all over church history and it's all undergirded by the belief that God is sovereign and that he positions his sons and daughters and agents and heirs as he wants them to be positioned within his kingdom, within his family of faith for the purposes that he has. So we're not supposed to think far off thoughts all the time, like Britta Perry from Community Does at the expense of what's going on right in front of our face. But also there's clearly a missional aspect to the Bible and an idea that you do look outward. You've got this whole idea in Acts 1 8 of Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the ends of the earth, the Christian that is thinking properly about how all this works is thinking in all of those categories, but especially thinking of doing good to those who belong to the family of believers. Samaria, we're going to do a weird episode and look at a very practical example of a time that has happened in the early church and it is going to be weird, but I think it's going to be fruitful. And if it's not, you can just pretend that I never said this because I won't actually publish that episode and we'll just roll on to the next thing. I guess we'll see what happens. All right, more on this tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
