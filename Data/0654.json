The social media site that the kids used to use, the college students used to use, you know, back in the 2000s or whatever it was. But then kind of the moms and dads took over and eventually the baby boomers took over and now Facebook, the kids, they don't use the Facebook anymore. But there for a little while they did, and I remember in the early 20s when everybody was on the Facebook and they would comment about things. They would make posts about their life and whatnot. And I remember one common type of post was the passive aggressive one where you say something about somebody who you know is going to see it and who a few people will know who you're talking about. But you don't really say who you're talking about. And you're like, wish some people would pay attention to the schedule and remember things that they agreed to do. That kind of not showing up and flaking out is the kind of thing that loses you friends. SMH. And then everybody else is like, what? What's going on? Are you okay? Oh my gosh. Are you all right? What happened? I'm so sorry. Everybody does that. But then like the person who it was about, I don't know exactly how they were actually supposed to feel. It was a technique and hopefully that's worn off. I don't know. I don't do the Facebook thing anymore. So you'll have to let me know if that's still a thing that occurs. But I always wondered like, what would it be like if there was some kind of rule that President Mark Zuckerberg put in place and he was like, Hey, if the algorithm determines that you made some kind of passive aggressive posts like that, you have to right after that followed up with exactly who you're talking about. Like you got to point the thing out, just call it out in front of everybody. I don't know if that would have been better or not better. But the first half of this little bit in Matthew 26, this horrible family blow up that happens at the last supper, the first half of it feels like it's going to head in the direction of that passive aggressive style Facebook post. But then as it unfolds, we discover like, Nope, that wasn't passive aggressive at all. That was just aggressive aggressive. It was like the cool calm, collected kind of aggressive where you call out directly the thing that the dishonest manipulator person is doing, which is that's Kryptonite to the dishonest manipulator game. And it turns out that this was no, this was right through the front door, very direct. And so here's the exchange I'm talking about again, think of this in the context of the new family of faith that Jesus is making. He pulled these guys together. He to the original audience would have popped as being like the father, the head of the household of this very familial household celebration of the Passover that's going on, but it goes sideways because one member of the family is being a turd. Here's how it goes. When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the 12 that language about reclining is something we talked about a couple of weeks ago. But again, remember, this is not like how you've seen the painting with everybody sitting at a big long board meeting table. And they're all kind of looking at each other up and down the way facing in the same direction. It wouldn't be like that famous work of art at all. It would have been an ancient Near Eastern style meal, which would have been very long. There are a lot of phases and movements to this particular meal, certain dance steps. And so you wouldn't sit in a formal upright chair like you would at a Northern European elbows off the table dining kind of event. You would have reclined. You would have lounged. You would have eaten at different times. You would have broken out into smaller conversations. And you would have heard the same thing out the windows from the other houses or apartments that were stacked up right next to you. It's pretty evident from the context here and over in Luke that we are talking about a part of town where the different familial households had multiple properties stacked up. I cannot remember the name of this particular style of home insulate. Maybe I mean, you got three styles of homes in the ancient world, right? You've got the super rich villa type thing. You can go see the most extravagant version of that left over from the ancient world in Hadrian's villa up the road from Rome and Tibley. Is that what it's called? You know, they're really patient with me when from time to time we have these very distinct reminders that I'm not descending from the mountain of knowledge here. I'm trying to remember this stuff and figure it out right along with you. So if I just butchered the name of where Hadrian's villa is and I was butchered the name of this third style of house and I'm super sorry, but I think you get the idea. So you got the super rich elite villa thing, which is like a whole spread with gardens and multiple buildings and servants. I mean, it's an acreage. It's massive. We're not talking about that here. Then you've got your basic family home. Some of these have been excavated in Capernaum. It looks like these would have had flat roofs and the kind of thing that you could run on as Jesus was talking about in the Olivet Discourse a little bit ago to get away from trouble if there was trouble happening and maybe several of these single story flat roofed homes for middle class people, especially outside the walls of a larger city. Maybe they would have been inside a single enclosure and you would have had multiple generations living in multiple dwelling spaces all connected together with a courtyard in the middle, maybe a common cooking or dining area. And then in the really high value real estate city center densely populated areas, you would have more stuff like what you picture in Chicago or New York where you got a little storefront down on ground level and maybe the building owner has their storefront there and they rent out some apartments up above and the apartments are kind of connected like the trees in the Ewok village where you got little walkways or points of connectivity between them. I mean, the depictions and descriptions that I've seen from around the Roman world in this time, it's really pretty enchanting to imagine what it would have been like there. I mean, obviously you're going to have the smells because you're plumbing being what it was back then. But you're also going to have the good smells that drift in and out as other people are cooking. You're going to have the sounds of kids playing and people singing and chirping back and forth. And you could probably call out to neighbors you knew just right out the window. And so there would have been fascinating sounds and smells on the air tonight as they are reclining at the table, getting on into the meal as it were. This time at night, at that time of year, you would have had some cool breeze rolling through. There's a scene here that's pretty easy to reconstruct. It's pretty easy to imagine. And it's a beautiful scene. One of the last moments of peace, this new family of faith would have. And then just as maybe everybody is doing the thing where their eyebrows go up in the middle and they look around the room and they breathe real deep. And they just think to themselves, this is pretty neat, isn't it? We're going to look back on these times and think about how awesome it was. This has been a really nice meal and a really nice week, guys. And I'm just so glad we're all here together. And then while they're in that moment of tranquility, I imagine specifically the text says, and while they were eating. And he got Jesus interrupting the mood. And he says, I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me. I'm guessing it just got real weird and real quiet initially after that. Surely that was a mood buster. The text indicates that it was as they were very sad. I mean, of course they were and begin to say to him one after the other, surely not I, Lord. And I get why you'd want to do it. What an interesting social dynamic where it's not like, yeah, I think one of you guys would do this. And I read the social scenes and cues pretty well. I'm pretty sure you're going to act this way. But it's like you still have the option to maybe not act this way. But you're not interacting with just a really socially dialed person here. You're interacting with somebody who you know understands things about the future and has knowledge outside of time. And if he says it's going to happen, then it's going to happen. So there's really no point in debating whether or not somebody's going to betray him at this point. This goes right to it's not me, right? Like, I don't think I'm going to do that. It like right? It's not me. So it looks like before everybody can take their turn at asking this question. Jesus replied, verse 23, the one who's dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The son of man will go just as it's written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the son of man. It'd be better for him if he had not been born. Verse 25, then Judas, the one who would betray him said, surely not I, Rabbi, this is just like straight up lying, dude, like on top of everything else that you've done. Now you're going to come into this space and weasel right there in front of your family, your new family of faith in front of the people that you've got these war stories with and that you've gone through all of this with. And come on, Judas, it's just be realistic here. Have you seen what you've seen? Or not because surely you know he knows the answer to this question and surely you know, it's you. It's like the, I was like a 10th or 11th grade when we read telltale heart for the first time ever. And that noise from the dead guy that the murderer hears underneath the floorboards that are getting louder. I remember hearing that and just resonating and be like, Oh, that would be me. I do not do well with guilt. I'm very guiltable. Like sometimes I have it coming, but other times people have figured out how to exploit that. And man, those are some tough moments for me. And man, I would be, I would be like that guy. I would crack so fast. I got to remember to never ever, ever murder anybody and put them under the floorboards or I would totally not be able to keep it a secret. But apparently, Judas doesn't have that problem. And he's just completely at peace with being like, what? I mean, I don't think it would be me, right? Yeah. And I know that he uses the title rabbi, like master, like the person who he is wedded his fortunes to and who he is trusting to teach him and mentor him is triple quadruple twists of the knife going on here. But this is where it goes from something that looks like that passive aggressive Facebook scene that we were talking about at the beginning of our conversation here to something that looks nothing at all like that passive aggressive Facebook scene. Jesus is like, yeah, here, I'm just going to turn over my cards right now. Jesus answered. Yeah. Okay. Paraphrase is mine. I'll say it the way he said it. Yes, it is you. It's kind of like the deal with the prophet and David that we've talked about several times where it's like, what? That guy sounds like a jerk. No, let me know who that is. We're going to punish that kind of behavior. And then David gets told, yeah, you are that man. And likewise here, Judas gets told you are the man and not like in the flattering way between guys who encourage each other with that phrase playing sports. Like in the indictment way, you are that man. You are guilty. And then the way Matthew relays the chronology, the very next thing is, yeah, while they're eating. So they're still eating. This is still going on. Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, gave it to his disciples saying, take and eat. This is my body. And obviously we're going to look pretty closely at everything that is happening here with establishing the Lord's Supper, the Eucharist, everything that goes along with that. That's a very next thing. But a strange set of events to have backed up right next to each other at the exact same meal. But now Jesus isn't doing the passive aggressive thing. He's not pulling the stunt where he's like, somebody's going to be mean to me. And I want everybody to feel bad for me. He's doing the thing whereby turning over his cards and me like, I know who it is. It's you. I know exactly what you're doing. You're getting me killed. And I know exactly what the result is going to be. It's going to be precisely what I've said. It would always be, which is the establishment of his kingdom. He's making it very clear to his team, nobody is getting one over on me here. I am walking directly into this. And this is all in keeping with everything he's done and said that there's victory in his decision to go to the cross. This is the redemptive plan. It always was. And well, I want to keep going because I'm pretty excited about the passage, but we'll just pick it up where we left off tomorrow. If you've been tracking with the launch of this new good ideas for churches podcast, if you're in any way helping out with the church or some kind of ministry kind of thing, whatever you want to call it, this is a podcast that I'm helping out with and that my buddy Aaron is doing. And it's been really well received so far. Thanks. All of you have gone and checked it out, shared it with other people. We've got a fresh, I think, very forward thinking episode that Aaron's put together that is getting published as we speak. So I hope you'll go and check that out, whether you've given a look yet or not. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
