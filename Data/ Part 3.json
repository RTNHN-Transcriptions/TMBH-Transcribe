Matt is not in today. He's on vacation. So we took an old talk of his, broke it up into five sections, and you are here for day number three. We're glad you're here. We're connecting Matthew chapter five in the Sermon on the Mount with Jesus' perspective on the Pharisees in Matthew chapter 23. Are you ready? Because here's Matt. Matthew 5 17. Don't think that I've come to abolish the law or the prophets. I haven't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished. Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Right tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. So when we talk about law in the New Testament, we're talking about the stuff God actually said, but we're also talking about centuries of interpretations that have been added to that to make sure people are getting the actual law right. But additionally, when we say the law, this also refers generically to the first five books of our Old Testament. The law is just a term that describes the scripture. So then the law in that sense would include the story of Moses, the Exodus, the Ten Commandments, the burning bush, Abraham, all of that stuff. The thing that really sets up the whole destination and trajectory of the story of the Jewish people. Smart people could read Jesus to be talking about any of these three things. Any time we come across this word in the New Testament, what we have to do to understand what he meant or what anybody meant is to look at the context. The key to getting what Jesus is driving at with the word law is not by doing a detailed word study of the word law. The key to getting it is looking at what he just said in the sentence before. He's the fulfillment. What does it mean to fulfill a law? If we're talking about the law as the instructions of God. Well, then I suppose Jesus is the fulfillment in one sense because he didn't do anything wrong. But remember that the law, the instructions of God also include the sacrificial law. This is the stuff where God laid out what it looks like to make propitiation, to make it right with God when you screwed something up. There's all kinds of different sacrifices. Some of them are individual. Some of them are corporate, some of them happen at certain types of year. There's definitely ways to stab the animal and where to put it. It's some weird stuff. So how do you fulfill that law? Well, that gets into theology. We're going to get into that more later. But fulfilling the law in this case could be taken by the original audience to mean stepping in and completing what the law hints at. The law hints at the grace of God through the shedding of blood. The law hints that there is a sacrifice that can cover sin. Maybe what he's driving at, what I believe he is driving at, spoiler alert, is that he's the completion of that sacrificial law. What about the bonus laws? What if we take Jesus meaning to be all of the law, the case law, the extra stuff that things God had nothing to do with, but smart people made these rules back down the road? Well, in that case, maybe he's suggesting that all of that impossible to wade through confusion that comes with years and years and years of people writing more and more rules is finally sorted out in who he is, what he represents, and what he's teaching. Have you ever looked at a picture of how many pages of new law happened in our country every year at the federal level? Last year it was 24,000 pages of new law that happened at the federal level. Of that, a tiny percent happens democratically and most of it's written by unelected committees. You get a weird system. In that weird system, because everybody gets to make laws, you stack that stuff all the way to the ceiling in this room, there's no way you could read through that or understand it. We do that every single year, every single year. Have you ever tried to build something? Have you ever tried to make a move that affects the larger world and had to engage with that world of regulations and laws? Whoa! It's insane. In the process of doing that, have you ever felt like, oh, wouldn't it be great if we could just get to a place where we could just function with each other, without 24,000 pages of new law per year? Federally, that doesn't include state and local, by the way. It's burdensome. It's overwhelming. Have you heard that ignorance is not an excuse? It doesn't matter whether you're familiar with the law or not, if you break it, you're guilty. That's how law works. It's a burden. It weighs on us. It adds up. Laws don't go away. Let me give fewer every year. By the time those of you who are little kids are 80 or 90 years old, they tag on 24,000 of these things a year. What's society going to look like? Well, I'll tell you, we'll all feel the same thing that they felt then. The law is a weight. It's unintelligible. It's not understandable. I can't do all of that stuff. Have you heard the estimate for how many laws we break every day? I've heard anywhere from a dozen to over a hundred. I've heard that it's more than a thousand violations of the law every year that we make, most of which, I mean, three or four miles an hour of the speed limit. I know what I'm doing, but most of it, you don't even know your breaking laws. So it was here. Their legal system is a little different because it was hitched to a religion, but it created the same effect as ours does. You can't know it. You can't get it right. You're really just at the mercy of the powerful people as to whether or not they're going to be cool with you this week. A state of perpetual guilt is what unending law creates. So if Jesus is saying or also saying that he's the fulfillment of the case law expression of the notion of law, that would be exciting. That would mean that what he's saying is, in me, you can finally offload this impossible burden of a list of things you can never possibly get right, put on you not even by God, but by worldly institutions. That'll be resolved in me. Either way, that's pretty exciting so far. But third thing, what if Jesus isn't talking about being the fulfillment of the law just meant the Old Testament? That's pretty exciting too, because that Old Testament came with three promises, three big ones. If he's the fulfillment of that story, that means that Jesus would be claiming to be the completion of the covenant promises to Abraham. That means that Jesus would be saying that in him that promise of a new people set apart for God is fulfilled and completed. That sounds king to me. It would mean, if he were saying that he's the fulfillment of the Old Testament, that he's also saying, I'm the completion of the covenant with Moses. That's the one that comes with all the sacrificial stuff. That's the one that says that this thing is a conditional deal, but if he's the completion of that, maybe God's grace, maybe God's patience and forbearance becomes unconditional in Christ. At this point, if we're just reading this cold from the beginning, we can't know that yet, but we might start to suspect it. And finally, if what Jesus is claiming is that he's the fulfillment of the Old Testament, then that would mean that he could be suggesting with all of this kingdom language that he is the king who was promised. He is the one who's going to show up who will initiate the truest, greatest, realest, most important thing in the history of ever, the kingdom of God. That what he is is the descendant of David, the ultimate king, the great king, and that this is the initiation of what all of history has been waiting for. If you sit around and talk with theologians, you may get into an argument where one says, Jesus is clearly talking about the law of God and the sacrificial law, and this is what he must mean. You might talk to the next theologian, and they'll say, Jesus is clearly talking about case law and the extended law, and therefore this is what he means when he says he'll fulfill it, not abolish it. You'll talk to others who will say, no, no, no, the law was just a slang term for the Old Testament, so this is what Jesus must have meant when he was talking about the Old Testament. All those people are smart, but I would suggest, why does it have to be one? He is the fulfillment of the law in any of those terms, and beyond that, he's going to go on to clarify aspects that fit all three of those descriptions. I think it's reasonable for us to say, we're talking about Jesus, God in the flesh. We're talking about the culmination of God's redemptive plan. When he says fulfill the law, I say, let's shoot the moon. I think what he means is every aspect of the law that you can imagine that needs fulfilling and completing, he is here to fulfilling complete. Back to the big point, defining the relationship. Got a bunch of people saying, we had a way we did things for a long time, we have promises we're looking forward to, we have rules and stuff, they work a certain way. It's compelling, we believe it, a sea parted, our people wouldn't exist if that hadn't happened. I think it's legit. Jesus has healed, people is teaching, makes enormous sense, he's credible, he's right, he's moral, he's ethically standing right in front of me doing amazing things. This is also compelling. Can these two things be true? And in just two verses, Jesus makes it really clear that the relationship is one that pivots, that hinges on him. The relationship between the old and the new hinges on Jesus. The relationship between God and people hinges on Jesus. The relationship between our sin and our weakness and our brokenness and the hope that we might have in God hinges on Jesus. Well that's enough for today. Thanks again for being part of this conversation. We'll be back tomorrow with part four. Hope to see you then.
