This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast, and I know that there are a bunch of you listening right now who've been a part of this thing since the very beginning. So I want to give the special internet high five to people who have been doing this all the way since the start. I also want to say, hey, to everybody who's come along along the way, the people who have been shooting me emails and telling me that they powered through hundreds of episodes of this conversation. I think you're amazing. I think it's incredible that any of you would take the time in the middle of all the stuff you have going on to hang out with me for a chunk of time every day to talk about the book of Matthew. I'm so grateful for those of you who are just jumping in. Now you can just pick it up with us right here. It'll gradually make sense as you go along. And at any point, if you want to, you can go back to the beginning of all of it and play catch up as well. I've heard from people who've done it both ways and whatever you want to do is awesome because it's the internet and you don't have to do anything in a certain way, which is part of the beauty of this format and the relationship we get to have together talking about the book of Matthew. I didn't write this. I don't own this. I don't understand all of this, but I care about it. And I can see that it's important and that it's interesting and that it has shaped our world, whether people believe there's a deity behind it or not. And so the goal of this project, once again, is not for me ultimately to subversively wear you down and get you to think all the things I think about the world and politics and how to read the tricky passages and to believe all of my things religiously or to get you to not believe the things you may be already. But I'm not interested in any of that. What I am interested in is taking a very careful look at a very important book, doing my very best despite biases and presuppositions to give a neutral read on what seems to be being held out by the author of the text and get to a point where I have this thing. I use this expression a lot in my hip pocket or I feel like I own this book. I've got it. I'm really tracking with this one. The other 65 books of the Bible, they might be a little confusing still. I might have a ways to go, but I want to be to a place where I've got this one and I want you to be to a place where you've got this one as a touchstone for thinking about the rest of the Bible and for people who ultimately look at the story of Jesus and the Bible and are like, I'm in. I want us to be in with eyes wide open. I don't want us to be manipulated or tricked or worked over or only showed the easy stuff and you duck the hard stuff. I'm the kind of person and if you're here, I suspect you're the kind of person who doesn't like to do the lie to ourselves thing. I want to come at this thing with honesty. I want it to say what it says. I want to be uncomfortable with the parts I'm uncomfortable with. I want to grapple with it. And if ultimately we're in a place where we say we think there's a God behind this and we're in on the Jesus thing that needs to be with eyes wide open. Also, if you ultimately reject this, like I just, I don't see it. It doesn't compute. I looked at the same data you did, Matt, and it doesn't add up to me. Okay. Cool. You know, hey, I've got to respect that. What I hope happens is that that rejection is also with eyes wide open. You would look at it and be like, okay, I see it. I get why people would appreciate it. I understand why my religious friends see things in it and rather than hearing stuff secondhand from the internet. I did the work. I looked at it and I landed where I land. If we can do that regardless of where we land, not only is that an honest run at the text, but it is in keeping with the passage that we're looking at right now in Matthew chapter 13, which is the parable of the sower. It's a story that Jesus tells about a farmer who went out to sow seed and he's scattering the seed and some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up. And then some fell on rocky places where it didn't have much soil and it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. But when the sun comes out, the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root. And then other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked out the plants. And still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop 160 or 30 times what was sewn. So it doesn't take a Bible genius to look at this passage and realize that Jesus is acknowledging what you and I were just talking about a second ago, the reality in the grand scheme of history that the same data or data packet, the genetic information of the kingdom that is contained within those seeds, the same data gets in front of people throughout history and three out of four types of people look at it either with a deep long look or a quick passing look and ultimately reject it correspondingly according to the parable. One of the four types of people who are exposed to this seed have it take root and it becomes who they are and what they think, which means given what you and I were just talking about, if you happen to be one of the people in whom this story, the Jesus thing takes root. It's kind of hard to be mad at somebody who would be representative of one of the other three types of soil because the Bible says that not everybody's going to sign up for it. I would suggest that everybody should and is a really good idea and that it's true and it's real. This isn't relativism that we're getting from Jesus, but it's realism and it's a realism that tempers expectations a little bit because for the person of faith in whom that seed takes a deep root, you look at it like this is so obviously true. This is so obviously meaningful and the temptation then can be there to be like anybody who doesn't believe it must be an idiot or dishonest. And I think that's a crappy way to think about other people. The reality of the overt language of the text at every turn is that it is tremendously good, the goodest thing of all to respond rightly to Jesus and that is incredibly perilous. The most perilous thing of all, not to respond rightly to Jesus, but the text also makes it clear that it isn't really the job of that fourth type of soil to go around and bark at everybody else and judge everybody else who isn't a part of that fourth type of soil. That isn't the point of the parable and further as we look at these different types of soil, it could take a while to tell which is which anyway. So if people start getting real reckless and being like, you're that or you're that, well, what if you're wrong? What if you're reading the data incorrectly because even the imagery here indicates that it might take a little while to sort out. Of course, there's another parable coming up here in just a few verses that reiterates that idea. So we hear this parable. The disciples then are like, wow, why aren't you just going through the front door with all of your teaching? Like you usually do. Why are you doing the parable thing all of a sudden? And Jesus goes back to the prophet Isaiah to explain that there's an element of God opening eyes and shutting eyes, opening ears and shutting ears that people can see but not perceive that there's a decidedly supernatural element to this. That if anybody does see that is in some way a gift from God and by the work of God. And then in verse 16, Jesus says, bluster your eyes because you did see. So it's not even like, great job though, guys, because you saw a high five rather even the language Jesus chooses here in verse 16 puts the human individual in the more passive position and God in the sovereign position. This isn't to say that we can look at this text and suppose that human agency isn't a thing or that Jesus is writing off the idea of human participation. I mean, clearly there's judgment implicit in chapter 13. There's judgment implicit even in the parable of the sower. There's also victimhood implicit. I mean, it's not the path's fault that birds came along and snatched up the seeds. It's not the other shallow soils fault that is shallow and the sun was there and it was hot that day and it burned things up. I mean, it's not the soils fault that a bunch of thorns grew up right there. So here we are with the same friction involving human agency, human decision, the human heart, the human ability to perceive or willingness to perceive and we come away asking questions. Like, well, so with these soils that ultimately don't receive the seed and produce a crop that does produce 160 and 30 times what was sown. Why is it the fault of these outside forces? Is it the fault of the individual or to stretch the metaphor, the soil that was like, no, I didn't get it. Was it low aptitude? Is it a willful, angry, eyes wide open rejection? Is it a good natured, honest, well-intended rejection? Is it some mix of all of this stuff or is it just the sovereign superintendents of God? Look, they're way smarter people with me who would vehemently disagree with what I'm about to say, but it looks to me like there are elements of all of these things that can be present, though it also looks like the sovereignty of God is the top-level reality, the top-level truth-definer and all of this. It doesn't look like any of these possible outcomes that can happen are happening apart from the attention and the will and the authority of the God character. Still, real simply, none of the soil deserved the seed. The soil doesn't demand the seed. The soil is not in the driver's seat here. It was an amazing gesture of grace, metaphorically speaking, for the sower to even give the soil a chance to respond to the seed, and whereas from a 20th-century fairness human perspective, we might be mad that the sower, that the king, that God didn't go around and make sure every single one of those seeds fully took from the biblical perspective, well, there's no friction or stress here at all. Did you notice that the Bible isn't apologizing at all for God's superintendents over opening and shutting eyes and the seed being received or not received? It is really interesting when you read through this document with lenses for the historical, theological fights that are trendy in this century or that century when the spirit of the age or the philosophy of the moment is this way or that way. There's always friction against the God that the Bible holds out as being the deity over all things in any given generation, in any given age, but it's funny when you go and look at the Bible, it's like that lady who's totally secure in her own skin, she's like, yep, I am wearing cheetah prints and my hair is like this, and that is exactly how my sunglasses look. And I am drinking a 44-ounce diet coke I've been hauling around all day in my circled cake container that I've had since 1987. What are you going to do about it? There's just certain people you meet who are so comfortable in their own skin, and likewise, the Bible is so comfortable in its own skin. It's never come with its hat in its hand and being like, I'm so sorry that elections seems to be an idea that appears in the Bible at times. No, like anywhere the idea that God has a say and people's salvation comes up is like, that's awesome. This is the greatest thing. The Bible never shows up with its hat in its hand. It's like, I'm so sorry about how we described creation and the end of time. Like I really wanted everybody to like it and agree with it and see what we were driving at. No, it's frankly kind of vague about those things. Like, no, I told you what you needed to know. There we go. This isn't a fight. This is awesome. Look how God is great. And likewise here, the middle of Matthew does not have Jesus appearing with his yarmicine in his hand being like, Oh, no, this is probably going to really bother you guys. Very, very apologetic about how God set this up with the, I know it seems like super unfair and it doesn't anticipate that crisis at all. It's here's exactly how the thing is. This is what it looks like when you have an interaction between a divine unlimited infinite being and finite people. The divine unlimited being sees things outside of time is bound by nothing is master of everything. It's very hard for people to understand. People are linear. We are in a temporal continuum. We see things a certain way. When you put the two together, it's going to be confusing not for the infinite party, but for the finite party. No surprises there. The Bible treats this as being actually something that is praiseworthy when directed toward God. You know what's hilarious? I was actually going to start looking at Jesus unpacking of the parable in verse 18. And that did not happen. So I guess we'll just do that part tomorrow. But really seriously this time tomorrow we're actually going to do it. And it's going to be great. RMI friends, we're going to hit pause there.
