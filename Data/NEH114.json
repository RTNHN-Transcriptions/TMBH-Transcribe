It's best, fun, free, daily, deep-dye Bible. And right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here, or you can always go back and start at the beginning of an easy thing. The whole podcast is available in an easy to use format at thetmbh.com. To what extent do the things that happened in the distant past to your ancestors? Good, bad, whatever. To what extent does that inform your life now? And to what extent do you own that both for better and for worse? Let me give you an example of something I'm talking about. As we've discussed, I am descended directly from a man named George Whiteman. He was a dude who was right on the edge between being an Orthodox, historical, Protestant Christian, and a heterodox Christian who maybe thought some stuff that is just outside the boundaries of historic Christianity. He wavered. I don't know. He was right on the edge. Well, he was so right on the edge that King James I didn't like it. King James is like, all right, we're going to burn. Yeah, to make point, can't have people thinking stuff like that. So they did stuff in Europe back then in the 1600s. And so King James, the guy in charge of the King James Bible, he burned my great grand daddy. It's very disappointing as a family. You hope none of your family members will get burned for religious or any reasons. But it happened. Well, part way through the burning, George Whiteman was like, never mind. I call it off. I don't think that anymore. And they were like, Oh, cool. And then you don't have to get burned. Take them. You're getting down from there. We're not going to burn them at all. But then a little while later, he's like, no, some of that stuff you were going to burn before I still think it and I can't back down. And they were like, okay, well, then we're going to finish burning you. And they did. And they killed him. He got burned at the stake. The last guy ever to be burned at the stake for religious thought crime in England. It happened in the 1600s at Litchfield in England. And then the rest of the family, they took off and they went to the United States and a couple of sons of George Whiteman founded a whole bunch of churches in New England. And then all kinds of crazy things happened eventually after the Revolutionary War. My family maybe had a falling out with God. I don't know. It kind of sounds like my own story. Faith that seems like kind of went cold in my family for several generations. And my family eventually moved west. We had some brothers that went down and fought to free the slaves in the south and then moved further west into Nebraska and got some land and raised cattle. But then the depression happened and my grandpa has this story about the day that the market had flipped upside down is too expensive to feed the cattle. So they had to kill the herd, which was representative of all of the generational wealth acquired by the Whitman family. And then granddad became a parts dealer in Guernsey, Wyoming, which I think is super noble and he was so good. Such a good man. Pure honor through and through a prince and a gentleman, a wonderful man. Now then my dad became a Christian in the driveway out in front of the house. There's a dude who took an interest in my dad and the whole gospel Jesus thing came into focus for him. Dad became a Christian first one in generations and generations in my family. And then, you know, I got my own story of the ups and downs and faith and all of that. So it's kind of wild, right? It's this big grand sweeping story across the continents and across an ocean with death and love and drama and betrayal and crisis is very, very interesting. Feels like the kind of thing that you'd make a mini series in the 1980s on TV about. But back to my original question and thank you for indulging me as I talk about my family a little bit here. How much of that do I own? To what extent would it be reasonable for me anytime a King James, only a Christian brother or sister comes into my comment section and yells at me for using not the King James? How much would it be okay for me to be like, Hey, too soon, man. King James burned my grandpa. Like I know you like his Bible or whatever, but it's personal for me. Happy. Okay. Like maybe I have the best reason of anybody ever not to use a King James Bible or is that just stupid? Cause like everybody's dead, super dead. It just doesn't count that way. You got to think about it differently. There's got to be a detachment, but also, I don't know what about the stuff that is great about the world that the last four or five generations of my family built, including freeing the slaves and the American South, but also what about the stuff that is problematic about the world? The stuff that maybe still needs to be figured out and the role that me and my forefathers have played in making things that maybe aren't always perfectly just and whatever you view society's problems as being, do I own the good stuff there? Do I own the bad stuff there? What do we do? Well, in a Western civilization, especially the American West, we generally think of things pretty independently. I don't necessarily own all that stuff. I also maybe don't necessarily get all the benefits of everything that came before. You kind of got to make your own way with each generation. Maybe there are some people who think of it differently in other parts of the country. But practically speaking, who is to be held to account then for the ills of society that nobody's alive who made those, they just sort of self proliferate. They're on autopilot now. How does anybody repent of that? Is it okay for everybody to just be like, I didn't do it. It wasn't my thing. I guess maybe we should stop that now. Who owns stuff culturally? And obviously, look, you're smart. I know when I'm recording this and I know this is a politically loaded idea most of the time when people talk about it, it isn't here. I'm not driving toward some kind of weird partisan talking point or something like, come on, I don't do that to you and I'm not going to do it here. It's an honest actual question about the cycle of life, not about stupid American politics, which is not the hub of all thought and not the center of all things and all of the history of the world. Really seriously, who's responsible for how things are right now? How much does the good stuff of the people from before also? Like how much should that pass along? I've thought about it more and more as I've gotten to know the story of my family better. But I've also been thinking about it a lot as we have gone through this whole chunk of podcasts together talking about the Persian era of the Bible, Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther, because there's so much here about generational blessing, generational sin, whatever generation is alive, having moral custody before God of the institutional sins and vices that they have either even if they didn't make them like they're here, you got custody of them now. Who else is there is going to repent for these evil things that exist if not the people who are alive to currently own it, even if they didn't make it in the first place. These themes are very challenging to me, my friends, as a man of the West, I have a beard. I cut wood. I weighed in mountain rivers with a fly rod and I usually don't even wear waiters. I'm just in there interacting with fish. I have confronted multiple bears. Sometimes I see mountain lions in the places where I go. I walked up to a wolf one time because I wanted to see how close I could get to a wolf without it freaking out. The answer is surprisingly pretty close. I'm a man of the West from the mountains. I'm very independently minded yet these passages and this time in my life learning about my history have really given me pause. There's no resolution to that. I'm just telling you, when we do this stuff together, this isn't something where I write it every day and then I tell you how the Bible and the world is. I don't actually know that coming in. I am learning with you and it is challenging me to and I'm thinking about stuff. This has been something that I'm thinking about and Nehemiah 9 really makes me think about it because a whole bunch of people are about to get together and send away the people who are not clearly a part of their ethnic group and then publicly visually repent for their own stupid stuff. But also for the stupid stuff that came before, but they're not just going to repent for the stupid stuff. They're going to do all of this stuff in the shadows of a temple that they did not build a great accomplishment, a blessing to them that they only own because of the good things that the people before them did. Nehemiah 9, this is what we get here. On the 24th day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together fasting, wearing sackcloth and having dust on their heads. That's everybody. This is quite the contrast to what we were doing a couple of days earlier when everybody's in booths and celebrating with the choice of drink and choice food. Verse 2, Nehemiah 9 here, those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the wickedness of their fathers. Okay, I get the personal confession thing. I'm into that. I don't always like it, but I'm willing to do it. And I realize that my life can't function if I'm not willing to do it. I have to be willing to own my crap. Sometimes I don't see my crap right away and it takes a while to own it. Sometimes I'm just kind of stubborn and prideful and I write narratives for myself that always happen to make me look good when I'm so insecure and emotionally needy that I cannot admit that it was my own dang fault. But usually I think I can come around to admitting it was my own dang fault when it was my own dang fault and then I can own that and square it with people. I don't know that I've ever repented for the sins of my fathers before though. I like my dad. I like my grandpa on my mom's side. I like my grandpa, my granddad, we call him on my dad's side. I don't have really anything bad to say about any of my grandparents going back for generations. This feels very foreign to all that weird mountain mentality and environment in which I live. That also it seems totally appropriate when you're reading through the Old Testament, doesn't it? It feels like there is some sort of genetic wickedness that is being handed down. Do not misunderstand that phrase for some kind of racist thing like there's a deficiency with the Jews. Gross. No, I mean, there's a genetic moral deficiency handed down in all people groups. There are problems that are bigger than us and that predate us and they get passed along through nature and through nurture, I think. It really stands stark relief. It pops in the story of the Old Testament as you go through it. This is bigger. The problems here are bigger than one dude or one lady who really did naughty bad things. There's lots of poor individual choices, but all of those choices happen in an environment where they're mostly allowed or tolerated hardly ever. Anybody does anything to check the really bad stuff that people do and that indicates social, moral, ethical, religious, societal corruption that happens a lot. If we looked at any other people group from the same time frame during the Old Testament here, we'd see it in them too. People are screwed up. We have problems. Also, there's some noble things mixed in there. Both can be true. They all get together. What was one guy's prayer in Nehemiah 1, Nehemiah alone saying, forgive me for my own wickedness and for the wickedness of my fathers, is now a prayer of the entire people groups. I mean, on the one hand, that's just an amazing testament to the courageous moral leadership of this one guy, more on that as we work through the rest of the book. On the other hand, it's kind of the moral trajectory of the entire book. Things get started because one guy acknowledges, I have problems and also I have custody and ownership of problems that existed and were made by my forefathers who I am both grateful to and revere, but also they really got things wrong. And I took over getting those things wrong when I got here and I repent of both of those things. It's gone from one guy feeling that to everybody kind of realizing that at once and it does feel like that's the antidote or part of the antidote is getting this place of realization of we as humanity. We really do have a problem that we cannot kick and it really is bigger than our own volitional decision making because it transcends generations and it involves people like the sins of people who are dead are still here and still playing out in the world. What do you do with that? Well, it demands pretty aggressive repentance, collective repentance, but also it demands a savior, a deliverer who transcends time, transcends generational evil and generational failure to fix stuff that on paper seems like it would be hard to fix because of the linear nature of time. So here they all are. They're not going to make everybody else come in here with them and own their sins. The cuts both ways that people show up and they're like, we want to, we're not Jewish, but we're going to help rebuild the thing. And it's a rubable and Ezra and Nehemiah are like, no, no, you're not. This isn't your thing. Well, I mean, it kind of pays off here when those same people are like, do we, are we supposed to do the sackcloth and stuff too? Should we apologize for our ancestors? It's like, no, you're also excluded from that. You don't have to do this either. But here they are. All these relights owning their thing altogether. That sort of feels like the beginning of change, doesn't it? And there's no holding back here. Everybody's like, this is my thing. This is my family's thing. We really have had a problem and we really want things to be different this time around. And we mean it and we're willing to say it together in unison. And we're all covered in dirt and filth and everything else to make it clear that we really mean it. It feels like change. It feels like getting it. And I got an announcement that for the sake of time, we're going to get to tomorrow, but it's a fun announcement. All right, that's plenty. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
