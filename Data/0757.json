Isn't that fun to imagine? The crazy stuff that happened in ancient Greece, the things that Alexander the Great might have done, or entire empires who are just gone, got wiped from the face of the earth by a natural disaster or some kind of plague, or they got wiped out by an enemy you have heard of and they're like, now, we hated these people so much. Nobody's even going to know they existed. We're not even going to record that we defeated them. They're just gone. It's kind of wild when you sit around and try to do the math in your brain as to what percentage of stuff that happened is recorded in some way or known in some way. And what percentage of stuff that happened is just totally gone. And that sense every time something only one person remembers dies, it's like time clears its browser history. But then every now and then you get one of those things. It seems like it's way, way, way out there. And yet somebody wrote it down. So now everybody has access to it and history just can't forget it. And it just sits there like a rock in your shoe, this little nugget from the past. I think that's what we get in Matthew 27. Jesus dies, temple curtain tears, earthquakes, rock split, presumably as part of the earthquake and rock splitting. The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs and after Jesus resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. I want to come back to the question that we were just looking at and how does this happen? How does this get forgotten or mostly forgotten? But first, let's just try to break down the text here in terms of the timeline and what it looks like actually happened. So yet the earthquake and the rock split. And like I said, I think that's probably meant to be connected to the idea of these tombs opening up, whether that's related or not pretty clearly. The idea is there's this tremendous unleashing of power, creation shrugs and shivers at the death of the son of God on the cross and the bodies of these holy people are raised back to life. He says many. So we're not talking about one or two or five or maybe even 10. I think we're talking about probably more than that. And the indication is that these are holy people. What does holy people mean? Are we talking about? Are we talking about people from before the lifetime of Jesus? Remember, it sounds pretty horrifying to imagine a body coming back to life. But if we look at Ezekiel 37, the passage with which this one is clearly connected, then we see that those rattly dry bones out there in the valley, they came together and God was like, well, I mean, we're not just going to do like a walking skeleton thing. And he puts sinews and flesh and tendons on there and breathes into them life. So we're not talking about the undead or some sort of soulless animated corpse that isn't reflective of the person. We're talking about people coming back to life in the sense that they are thriving. And so are we talking about people from way back then? I mean, they could be totally dry bones. That's the reference to Ezekiel 7. I don't think we get a timeframe for how long we're talking about here. Or are we talking about people who had already had some kind of an encounter with Jesus and had since died? Who would that be though? I think this is going to be a fun exercise. Who knew Jesus? Well, he was alive and probably would have believed in him and a kingdom citizen, if you will, but now is dead and we know that for sure. Well, it looks like Joseph was probably dead. Did Joseph come back to life? Would he be one of the holy people who knew Jesus and then died? It seems weird that Jesus would hand Mary off to John if Joseph was coming back. But maybe Joseph, we haven't talked about how long this is for. These people go on to live regular lives and then just die or were they gone. So it's kind of interesting to think that maybe there's some kind of reunion there with his dad. Yeah, I'm just musing. Then what about Anna? Anna and Simeon, the people who that's in Luke, right? All right, go look. I think it's in Luke 2 that we get the stuff about Jesus and the dedication. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Luke 2, 36, there was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Fanyuil. That's a tricky name of the tribe of Asher. She was very old and she lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, but then was a widow until she was 84. She never left the temple, but worshiped every night and day, fasting and praying. Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. And then right before that, Simeon is another person who says this child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be spoken against so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed and a sword will pierce your own soul to Simeon said that to Mary offered that as a blessing. That's a pretty intense blessing. Then he also said stuff when he took Jesus in his arms, Luke 2, this is like little kid Jesus, sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace for my eyes of senior salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel. Wow, there's a lot there. Maybe I'm forgetting some obvious people from the story of Jesus' life. Let me know if you can think of any that are slipping my mind as potentials for who might have been a holy person from the past who would have been up and about. But let's just gain that out a little bit. What message does it send when a few days later, after Jesus' resurrection, these people get up and walk into the city? I think it's going to have a similar effect on people who have said their goodbyes and have known that this person was gone for a long time as the culmination of all of this stuff has on the centurion here in Matthew 27, who in the next verse sees everything that's going on. It's like, oh, whoa, surely this guy was the son of God. If we take this at face value, which I do, and I acknowledge that there is an apocalyptic literature, symbolic view that some people hold, I talked a little bit about that yesterday, but if we read this as being something that Matthew is delivering to us in historical succession with other historical events, like the curtain and the earthquake and the darkness and all of this stuff, and we don't see any reason to imagine that he has come out of literal historical presentation and into some kind of metaphor here, then it does bring us back to that difficult question about things that get forgotten and things that don't get forgotten and things that perhaps should be forgotten. How does something like this happen and nobody else writes it down? Well, first of all, that question assumes nobody else did write it down. It is entirely possible that lots of people wrote it down. Lots of people talked about it. Lots of preliterate people talked about it. And just one at a time, they died and their memories went away. Most of what has been written down in the history of ever, especially if you go pre-electronic age is gone at this point. So it's possible that Matthew was drawing on a tradition here that lots of other people had in writing in front of them as well. And this is just the one that comes all the way down to us. We see in the Gospels that there was an active persecution campaign to suppress information about the resurrection because it's utterly damning for the religious leaders, for Jesus to come back to life. So it certainly would not be beyond the pale for them to carry out some kind of information and suppression activity to make other records of such a gigantic, memorable, convincing event just go away. That would serve them as crazy as it's going to sound at first. I think it's also possible that not everybody totally caught on to what was going on here. You don't have photography. You don't have an ID system. Most people wouldn't know what any famous people look like at this point in history. You'd only know them by what outfit they're wearing and what the heralds call when they come rolling into town. Maybe the emperor and a few prominent politicians would have had sculptures or portrayals duplicated and circulated enough that a handful, half a dozen people, maybe in the entire empire at any given time would be known just by how they look. If even that, remember somebody had to kiss Jesus in order for people to even know who he was and he was among the most famous people in this little window of history ever. Everybody was excited about it. He was the biggest deal in the entire city, but people still didn't know what he looked like because of the nature of the time. Maybe dead people came back into town and the people who knew who they were were like, what the heck? That's a dead guy. I missed you. It's so good to have you back. I recognize you because of how your face is. But maybe other people, it was easy for them to be skeptical because they were like, prove it. How do I know that guy was dead? He seems fine to me just because a few of you are saying he was. I don't know. Maybe you were mistaken. I don't know him. Part of what you got to take into account here is that it is possible for an event like this to happen. And because of the limitations of identification at that moment in history, a suppression campaign, an active attempt to counter this information could theoretically be effective in sowing doubt to the point that nobody would really want to write it down. Another historical factor that I think we need to take into consideration here is the question is, how long were these people alive if this is to be understood as having literally happened? Were they alive for a few days? And then they just went away? Maybe they ascended along with Jesus in Acts chapter 1 when that happens? Some people argue that. I can't name any of the people who I've heard make that case off the top of my head, but I've heard people say that, oh, all these people, they ascended into heaven, like the prophets of your in the Old Testament. And I don't really see anything in the text to suggest that that is true. I think the most natural expectation would be that the same thing happened to them that happened to other people who were resurrected, that kid in Nain over in Luke Lazarus, the people who were resurrected in the Old Testament. I assume they all just lived and then died again, which is weird, but Matthew does seem to be using this as an apologetic. That is to make the case that this happened. He's like, they went into the holy city and appeared to many people kind of like, hey, you could go ask around, you could go check and figure out whether or not that happened. Another thing to keep in mind is there's sort of a continental divide that happens here at the death of Jesus in Matthew 2750, where everything after that, granted it's only a chapter and change, but everything after that has a lot of emphasis on the physical reality of Jesus resurrection. He was there. He was eating stuff. He was hanging out with people. Other people came back to life. People saw him. When they were in the city, they were around. These things are testable. They were physical. They were real. This is not a hallucination. Matthew is really tripling and quadrupling down to make sure that we don't take him figuratively in regards to resurrection with Jesus. And it sounds like he's using some of the same techniques to make sure that as hard as it is to believe that we're taking him literally on this point as well. Yeah, I'm still working on this resurrected dead people walking around in Jerusalem thing. We're going to need another day on this, but that will be it tomorrow. We will wrap up this stream of thought and try to just nail down the big picture. Why is this stuff here? What is it meant to accomplish and how does that set us up for where we go next in the text? So hit pause. We'll pick it up where we left off tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
