You already know this, but I'm going to restate it anyway because it's real relevant here. I live in Rapid City, South Dakota, which is on the western end of South Dakota. That's a state in the northern Midwest for people who aren't from the United States. I don't expect you to know all of our silly little detailed geography. For the most part, South Dakota is an agricultural and ranching state, but the further west you go, the drier it gets, and then you get some cool badlands. Then when you get all the way to the very west end of South Dakota, you get the very beginning of the mountains that define so much of the American West. It's the first little range of mountains in the American West, and it's called the Black Hills. They're just beautiful, and one of the famous features of the Black Hills is Mount Rushmore. It's this amazing formation of rock that got carved in the 20th century to show for American presidents. It's meant to be a monument to citizen government, though it's been recast with some dumb architectural design choices to try to make it more of a monument to just the idea of the state in general, but that wasn't the point in the first place, and that sticks in my craw a little bit. But the place is really cool, and so for sure in the United States, and I think also in other parts of the world, when you talk about your big top four legendary anything in any category, sometimes you'll frame that up by saying, well, who's on your Mount Rushmore of, and then insert whatever category you're talking about? So who's on your Mount Rushmore of all time great philosophers? Who's on the Mount Rushmore of all time great singer songwriters? Who's on the Mount Rushmore of all time great Denver Broncos quarterbacks? Which, okay, it's obviously a way Manning, Russ, you got to do more. You haven't earned that yet. Who do you go with after that? This is really troubling to me. I've run into a fan existential crisis. Jake Plummer? Is that, I don't know, I'd be very interested in your feedback. See, this is what the Mount Rushmore discussion does. Even if it's just one guy sitting here, and I could just delete that and edit that out, but I'm not gonna, because it's real. When you start thinking the Mount Rushmore discussion, it slices two ways. The one way is, well, you don't want to deprive anybody of being on Mount Rushmore. It's Mount Rushmore. So if somebody's awesome, you wouldn't want to leave them out, but then the other way that it cuts is, you wouldn't want to put somebody unworthy on Mount Rushmore. I like Tim Tebow, but you can't put him on an all time quarterback Mount Rushmore for the Denver Broncos. Can you? At any rate, here's one that I want to do. Who's the Mount Rushmore of powerful, significant, influential women in the Old Testament? Now look, I know that there's a bunch of you here who are really into the Bible and Christianity, and you were raised around it, and you have never missed a beat. And that is awesome, because faith is a gift from God. I know that there are others of you here who have raised around Christianity. You've been around the Bible and that kind of stuff. You got a little dinged up along the way. So I've got weird church, or whatever, and I really, really, really empathize with you, because I have felt that way. And then I know there are others of you who are like, I am not quite sure what to make of it, or I'm here because I'm empathetic to people I know and love who are really into this stuff, and they make an effort to reach into my world, and this is one way that I make an effort to reach into their world. Or maybe you're just genuinely trying to figure out what you think about God in the Bible, all that stuff. So the point is, I know there's a whole spectrum here, and you don't have to be able to answer the following question off the top of your head to somehow be worthy of the conversation. It's okay not to know all of this off the top of your head, but for those of you who are up for it, maybe pause for a second if you're listening with somebody else and just game it out, who would you put on the Mount Rushmore of powerful, significant, influential women of the Old Testament? I'll just wait a second. This is the pause time. Three, two, one, and we're back. Okay, look, I wouldn't be talking about this in a series on Esther if I wasn't going to put Esther on my Mount Rushmore. She's going up there more on my case for why she belongs there when we get to the end. But now let's talk about some of the other candidates. How about Ruth? Not a woman of great power per se. She was in a position of massive vulnerability as she immigrated to another part of the world and basically had to go grab leftover pieces of grain out of a field to make ends meet for a little while. But ultimately, like Esther, but I think in maybe what is regarded as a little more admirable way on the front end of her story. She finds a way to express her interest in Boaz. They go through all the right steps. They end up getting married. And it's out of that line that we get King David and out of that line that we get King Jesus. So she's a pretty big deal by merit of what she achieved relationally and in terms of family. And I think a very strong candidate to be on this Mount Rushmore list. How about Deborah, the judge? She is in charge of Israel very briefly during a very chaotic time after the conquest and before we get into the age of the kings. And there's a time early on in the book of Judges, Judges chapter four where nobody's really up to the task of dealing with a gigantic crisis. And even the men duck it, but Deborah steps up. She's like, this is what needs to happen. And this is how we're going to tackle the thing. I think Deborah makes a very good case for being on this list. She is oft cited as an example of female strength and courage and bravery. And maybe only gets overshadowed by Esther in that regard in the Old Testament. I don't know. I'm working the list through in real time here. I don't have it in front of me. I don't know what my answer is yet. You're ahead of me in that regard. So Deborah goes on that list during basically that time, that conflict. There is another woman who's just awesome. I don't know if you can get on Mount Rushmore for doing this, but the commander who was persecuting the Israelites of, I should have looked it up. I think it was Hazor, but there's a good chance I'm going to look real stupid in just a minute. Let's say a rival of the Israelite people was harassing them and their main commander on the battlefield who's given up fits is a guy named Cicera and jail famously lures him into a tent with the promise of warm milk or something like that. And then he gets all comfy cozies and he lays down and she takes a tent peg and she drives it through his brain. And he dies from that. You don't want to get a tent peg driven through your brain. It's super, super, it's just you don't want that to happen. It happened to him. And so he died. And so that's all we really know about jail. I don't think that rises to Mount Rushmore levels, but it's pretty stinking cool. Okay. How about Eve? This is a pretty big deal, right? The mother of all of humanity, the common female ancestor we all share according to the text. She's the first one. And also you want to talk about influential both directions. They all human life springs from her womb according to the story, but also the curse is first introduced to the world. And a lot of people try to come up with some kind of big metaphor for womanhood or how women are or something out of that. And I don't see that. I just see humanity. I mean, one character and you get both sides of the thing made in the image of God of tremendous value with capacity to be a part of things that are tremendously redemptive and also with the capacity to be a part of things that are tremendously antithetical to the things of God. I think Eve makes a pretty good case. Then you get the wives of the patriarchs, Sarah, Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, Rachel, all of them. All of them would lay claim to a position on the Mount Rushmore of women in the Old Testament, women of influence in the Old Testament based on much like Ruth, familial relationships, what they did with their family. And somewhat what they did with their family was ugly. That's tricky for the purposes of this conversation. They got Hegar, you got Tamar, Miriam. Oh, Miriam might belong on that list. If so, I think she would go in the fourth spot for me. Okay, still gaming it out. Hannah, she's of significance Bathsheba Abigail. It's okay if you don't know who all of these names are. I'm literally gaming this out in real time. Okay, I think this is my Mount Rushmore. Let's see how it stacks up against yours. I am going with Ruth, Eve, Deborah, and Esther. And I might change my mind sometime in the next 24 hours. And I'm putting Esther at real close to the top, if not the top, in terms of influence and power. She's the last woman to play a meaningful role in the narrative of the Old Testament. And she's kind of a descendant among them all. Nobody else comes anywhere close to this level of royalty and authority. I mean, she summons a new holiday to be added to the list of, was there five that already existed at that point? She has the authority, that is, both by merit of just who she is and how she's regarded amongst the Jewish people, but also as wife of the king who's happy to abdicate the use of his signet ring for making rules whenever anybody wants to. She has the power to just make Purim happen. That is amazing. She also has the power to deliver all of the Jewish people with one act of courage. And Jael played an important role. Deborah played an important role, but the stakes don't seem quite as high as they do with what we just get from Queen Esther. All of these characters are compromised. All of them are flawed, though I think Ruth on my Mount Rushmore looks the best. Oh, I didn't mention Rahab either. Hmm. I still don't think Rahab makes it onto my Mount Rushmore. Maybe yours. Okay, this is a fun exercise. The point is this. Esther is truly remarkable and I don't want us to lose sight of that. At some point here, we just needed to have an episode. We needed to have a conversation where we stopped and say, where does she fit in the grand scheme of things for women in the Bible, women in the ancient history of Judaism? And it's really hard to think of anybody who ranks much higher in terms of purity and chastity and nobility and restraint. Oh, maybe we could come up with some candidates in terms of people with a direct line to God who seem to respond to his will and his wishes. Yeah, I think we can do better than Esther, but in terms of raw power and influence and leadership and really pretty much just using it for good. I think she has got to be right there at the top of the Mount Rushmore candidates. And this is obviously certainly one of those places, one of those conversations that we've had where I really want to hear from you. I'm super interested to hear your case for your Mount Rushmore, but I'm guessing that most of us are going to have Esther on there somewhere. If not, I look forward to hearing your case for why four other people are more deserving when you look at the scope of the Old Testament. Well, this was fun. Well, note, I just wanted to say thank you to all of you very thoughtfully reached out and inquired about how I'm doing health-wise knowing that we've got this big family New Zealand trip scheduled. We're supposed to fly out tomorrow and to resolve the tension of the, are we going to be healthy in time to go travel saga? The answer is unfortunately no. I popped a red hot COVID test here about two hours ago and met with the doctor and he was like, no, no way, dude. You can't do that. And he's right. I can't be on a plane for 20 hours contagious with what I have going on. And I really don't, I'm not feeling well. So shutting it down and resting up and getting healthy probably is the right call. So we canceled our trip and that's bummer and everything, but also it's okay. There's a bajillion things I'm super grateful for. And right now I'm grateful for the opportunity to rest for a little while, but I will tell you this, in the big run up to try to get ready to leave for this trip tomorrow, I have worked ahead. And for me, I have finished the book of Esther that'll unfold for you over the next few weeks. We are going to end up being a total of 185 episodes on this book. And it looks like the way things are going to time out with a fun little bonus week that involves Matthew chapter two and the Magi and Christmas-y things between Christmas and New Year's. It looks like we will be starting on Nehemiah at the very beginning of January, which feels very symmetrical and nice. I like it. So that means that for the next few weeks you'll be hearing from the last couple of days that version of me, sorry, in advance that you get this voice for that whole stretch. But like I said, I'm going to go rest and hang out with my family. It means a little bit of lay in low. And I really look forward to jumping into Nehemiah with you here really soon. All right, cool. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
