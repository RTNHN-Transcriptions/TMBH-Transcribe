We've talked about where it fits into the grand stuff that Jesus is saying about the unfolding of time and proper orientation for the kingdom citizen who is aware that at any moment the master could return, but also you got to gear up and pace it out in case it's a real long time and they're supposed to be like, we get all of that. But there's this deeper personal self evaluation introspective, what the heck am I doing here and how far between the lines of this parable should I be reading level to this story. Now I know I think it's still in all of the podcast descriptions where you look this up. It says it's the Bible without the sermon. And generally speaking, the idea is like, I don't know, here's the text. Sometimes I think things other times I thought I knew, but then it turns out I didn't know and it's a lot. It's a really big complex book. We'll just try to make sense of the raw materials and you can figure out what to do with it. And we don't think the same stuff. I think we still be friends. And even if we can't, it's the internet. So we don't live by each other and everything's going to be fine. Now you kind of take that tack with it. I think that's part of the fond of how we do this exercise together. But every now and then, come on, you feel it, right? Are you feeling it? Because I'm feeling it with this parable. We live in weird, weird times where we don't have a real solid grasp of even what the metrics are to evaluate the the rightness of how we live or what we're doing or what was worth anything. I think a lot of us Christians, not Christians, everybody are just walking around in this haze right now. Not really sure of what meaning is or how we contribute to things that matter or mean something. I think that's part of the reason we do so much performative stuff on the internet. And we feel that pressure to be performative in terms of always liking the current thing and always holding the right new opinions. And maybe for a moment creates the illusion of purpose or meaning, but deep down, I think all of us are in this bizarre, unprecedented moment in life where we're digitally augmented by the very machines you're listening to this conversation on and our sense of self and what we're going for and what constitutes a good and productive life from a Christian or non-Christian perspective is something where I just think our compass is spinning. And so then we get to this parable and from across the millennia, here is this ancient homeless guy who some of us would look at and say, that right there, that's God in the flesh. Like that's the maker of all things. God of God's king of kings. That's straight up like the main character of all of history. Others in this conversation would look at him and be like, that's a very interesting, very compelling character. And that's why I'm here. The God thing, maybe a little bit much. Not sure I'd go there, but you're still here. Wherever you are in that thing, here is this character from across the ages, speaking forward into time and he tells this simple little story that lights a fire under us and that it hits all the things in us that we're already a little bit insecure about and that everybody's wondering about, why am I here? What is the point? What am I doing? Do I need to change something? Should I be making something? Should there be a greater return on my potential on me as a person? Should there be something redemptive that I'm producing? I think we're sufficiently distracted that a lot of the time we can block out those questions. But when a story like this slaps us across the face, we can't help but ask the question and as soon as we do get slapped across the face with something like this, we discover, I don't know, I was very ready to ask the question. Well, what is the question that's pretty straightforward? Are you getting a return on the investment in you? Am I getting a return on the investment in me? How much has been vested in me? And what am I doing to be responsible and fruitful with that? This is a parable that strikes to the very core of the question, how am I living and might I need to change something and it makes us uncomfortable? We can't help but ask. So I don't know exactly how to tackle this part other than to say, I got a couple of things I've jotted down here that have stuck with me as we've been talking about it. And here's the first one. I think our brains gravitate right toward five talent guy and one talent guy when we look at this parable because we do live in the age where most of us are a weird mixture of self-loathing and also abject pride. I think it's a product of the moment we live in. Again, the technology, the social media feedback loops, we all live in the overly perfect people we see in our scrolls and our feeds who we also look at and know like, yeah, there's something real wrong with that is self-loathing and pride. We all got this weird bipolar dichotomy thing going on in our own brains. I think it's easiest to be like, I'm a five-talent guy and I feel that pressure. I got to do something. Or, man, I've been dealt a terrible hand. I'm a one-talent guy. What could I even do anyway? This is all stacked against me. It's really frustrating. But the reality is I think the two-talent guy is in there for a reason. And I think two-talent dude or two-talent lady is in there not because it really advances the story a whole bunch. Most of the story would be covered with just two characters. But there's not a lot of bloat in the Bible. It's pretty lean, pretty well-trimmed, pretty well thought-through thing. I think two-talent person is in there because that's who most of us are. Most of us haven't been dealt a horrible hand, especially if you're listening to this right now on an internet-connected device. It means you own a device that's connected to all the knowledge of human history. So we live in a pretty good moment. With whatever device you're listening to this on, you are effectively the wisest sage, magic-wielding wizard from any other era in all of history. Maybe we got some stuff that didn't bounce our way. I've had some stuff that didn't bounce my way. But in the grand scheme of things, probably not very many of us are actually one-talent guy. We've all been dealt a better hand than that. But also, come on, just objectively, five-talent guy is superlative. That is the best. That is top-notch. And I don't think I'm that at anything. I want to be competitive and I want to be good at things. I'd like to be just the best, best, best at something. But I know I'm not. And so maybe I had dealt a pretty good hand, but five-talent? I don't know. It's like absolute top-flight big leagues. Probably most of us would have to agree. We're not quite that either. So more likely, you, me, probably most relate to two-talent guy. What do we know about two-talent guy? Guys, pretty good at stuff. Serviceable. He's got people that he probably needs to help pull up. And he's got other people that he needs to probably look up to and get help from. Two-talent lady is probably somebody who's pretty competent and generally handles her business pretty well. And the expectation of the boss was that two-talent lady could definitely turn this around, handle that level of responsibility and deliver a return. I'll tell you one of the cool things about being two-talent guy or two-talent lady is there is a little bit less pressure there. I suppose one other benefit of being at peace with the reality that probably most of us are two-talent guy or two-talent lady is that it orients us a little bit better to just be appreciative for the provision of the master, the trust of the master, the vestedness of the master. It's also easier to accept this whole parable of the talents thing, not first and foremost as an existential instruction on what everybody ought to be fretting about and this pressurizing thing, but instead to accept it for what it first and foremost actually is, which is a pushback on the religious leadership in the days of Jesus and not that veiled allusion to the failure of people he had vested heavily in the redemptive project in the process of connecting people with God and further being two-talent person depressurizes the parable enough that I think it becomes easier to also latch on to the end part where it's like, oh, responsibility for kingdom things. It's going to get redistributed. Different people are going to be in the game and God's going to use some different tools moving forward to accomplish these tasks. So I don't know, maybe that's useful, maybe that's not useful. I'm just going to make a decision right now to cut this in two real time here because I got two more big things that I've observed and been reflecting on as we've been working it through. So we'll just finish it up tomorrow. I know there's a little different tone than what we normally do, but you've always been so cool about just flexing with wherever the text and life takes us together. So I appreciate that as always, and we'll just pick it up tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
