We don't believe the same stuff. I know there are a ton of you because I hear from you who aren't even sure that there's a God. You just think the Bible is interesting or maybe you hope there's a God, but you don't know what to make of it yet. I know there are some of you who really feel very strongly there is not one. And yet you think this is compelling stuff? You think the Bible is interesting? You want to understand other people and your life and so you're here and you're part of it. It's awesome. We all get to hang out together and you're all very gracious with me as I completely disclose where I'm at, which is a person who was raised around this, raised around belief, had the wheels completely fall off of that. Things got really weird for me. I went through a very difficult time and since had difficult time, I was kind of faith-built 2.0 for me and I'm pretty enthusiastically in even if the way I might verbalize is a little bit different at this point. So here we all are and we're having fun and we're hanging out. I know that not all of you pray. I do. The prayer is weird to me. I don't know exactly how to do it. I'm not sure I would say that I'm exactly good at it. If there is a good at it even in faith-built 1.0, I guess my prayers were formulaic, if you will. I said the things that I felt like I was supposed to say and that's good. I think there's examples in the Bible of how to pray. The Lord's prayer is beautiful. It's wonderful. It's from Jesus himself. Great way to pray. Awesome. I would like to think that I still try to emulate that. It also a lot of the times when I pray now, it's more like the bowling alley that has the bumpers up on the sides. I just kind of wing it down the lane and the ball bangs into the bumpers 8, 12, 30, 40 times before it finally maybe hits a pin or something at the end. It's not pretty. It's not perfect, but dang, if it isn't honest. That's where I'm at. Maybe you're in different places. That means though that sometimes when I pray, if I do the really honest things, I figure, I mean, if there's a God and he knows everything and he's unlimited in all of his capacities, he knows what I meant to say, even if I pretty it up with fancy words anyhow. So I'm just saying the thing. Here we go. Sometimes when I'm doing that, I pray with frustration toward my enemies and I don't have a lot of them. I don't keep enemies. I make peace. I like people. I take great pleasure in finding common ground with people who are not like me and I take even greater pleasure in trying to work things out with people who for whatever reason fault of my own, maybe no fault of my own. Just straight up don't like me. I like trying to patch stuff up. It doesn't always work. Maybe there are a couple you listening right now and you're like, hey, it didn't work with me. I'm still kind of grouchy with you. I'm really sorry. I really am. And I think I would still like chances to patch any or all of that stuff up still. Sometimes when I do have an enemy, my prayers are like, hey, straighten this person out. And sometimes in my honesty, those prayers are like a really straighten this person out. God, if you hear these things and you see what's going on and this is as unjust and screwed up as it seems like it is, I don't intervene. Do something. I don't know. You're God, vengeance is yours. You know what to do. I guess I feel sort of okay about those kind of maybe unseemly seeming prayers because they're in the Bible. There's all kinds of stuff in the Psalms where under serious arrest, the Psalmist particularly David is like, hey, correct. My enemies fix the problem. Push back on my enemies. Let them feel some of the pain there inflicting on other people. So maybe they'll stop or it'll be different. And so I don't know. Maybe you're much better, nicer, prayer than me. I don't even say that sarcastically. I totally believe that you probably are, but maybe there are a few of you who are like, dang, yeah, truth to be told. Sometimes I get into that place where I am praying for my enemies. I'm also praying for God to push back on my enemies. I'm praying for justice. I'm praying for things to get better. And I've been there at times, maybe even recently, you could say. So we get to this prayer in Nehemiah chapter four. And if you've never prayed that way, if you've never been to that place mentally, maybe just haven't gone through something that would merit that or draw out those emotions or that place that responds with God, you know, cool. That's awesome. And if you have never been there, then this prayer that we get to in Nehemiah four is going to be like, dang, dude, that might be a little much. Come on, Nehemiah. You're more Christian. Like just make your prayer nicer. It sounds so mean. Use the phrase, we just a lot more and say things that are more emotional sounding and soft hearted and don't say mean things in your prayer because prayers shouldn't have anything in it that sounds grouchy, but your prayer sounds real grouchy, Nehemiah. But you're like me and a couple of times in your life, your prayers have maybe been tinged with a bit more God. I want justice here. Make this thing better. Correct my enemies. Well, then maybe you get to this part and you're like, dang, well, that tells me a little bit about where Nehemiah was right here because this is some pretty intense prayer. Now, in Nehemiah four, we're getting into the third prayer of Nehemiah. And I got to say, so far the prayers that we've got from him are remarkable. You know, I'm biased toward this guy. I like him. I think he's cool and he's honest and he does things and he's the man in the arena. I respect him even if he's not perfect. But his prayers have been humble. He seems to acknowledge dumb stuff that he does. I think that's really important. You probably want to do that if you're going to pray that you want God to correct destructive things other people are doing. I mean, look at this. I confess the sins we Israel, including myself and my father's house have committed against you. We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses. That's in Nehemiah one. You know, what is it? Six and seven. So, I mean, yeah, this prayer in Nehemiah four that I'm going to read to you again here in a minute. This sounds pretty harsh, but hey, Nehemiah has been pretty harsh on himself as well. He's got a bit of a track record of being objective about screwed up stuff and bad behavior and bad motives because he knows it when he sees it in himself and he prays about that too. So it gives me in my mind a lot longer leash when he prays harshly in Nehemiah four and he's praying harshly about himself as well. And then at the end of Nehemiah chapter two, you count this as a prayer, the part where a sandballot accuses him of treason against the king. This is outrageous. You're rebuilding as well. He responds with an answer that's kind of directed toward them, but that also, I think, is directed toward God, the God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants will start rebuilding. But as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it. So now we're kind of getting both sides of it. At trust God, we're doing what we're supposed to be doing. Again, I think Nehemiah has got clarity on this through line from the prophecies of Ezekiel and Jeremiah that we talked a little bit about yesterday. I think he understands that God has said that he said to Moses, he said other places. Like if you do this, if you turn back to me, I will restore the people. I will restore you. I think he gets that. I think he's acting on it and trusting that God actually said that and the God actually means that. But in this second prayer, the second statement that could be construed as a little pray. We see him saying the positive stuff like, I think God is in this, but we also see him starting to say the negative stuff, but you're not. You are the other side of the equation here. It almost reminds me of Matthew 16 when Peter hits an ale in the head and Jesus like, Hey, who do you all say that I am? And everybody's like, Oh, some people say this. Some people say that. And he's like, Yeah, but who do you say that I am? And Peter says, Christ, I got them, Messiah. And Jesus is like, Yep, that's one. That's that's it right there. That wasn't even revealed to you by you. That's from God. And he says a bunch of other profound stuff that we talked about at length when we covered Matthew 16 in detail. And then right after that, Peter immediately screws up and Jesus is like, and I'm going to go die now. And Peter's like, No, no way, not on my watch. We'll never let that happen. And when push comes to shove later, Peter, of course, is the one to draw the sword and go chopping off ears, trying to prevent that from happening. But Jesus in Matthew 16, as soon as Peter starts saying that kind of stuff, says, get away from me, Satan. What Peter is saying is so antithetical to the plan and what God is doing in the moment that Jesus uses that kind of language. And there's a little bit of that tone here. You have no part in this thing away from me. So the prayer that we get in Nehemiah four, I burned all of our time, setting it up, whatever we got time to split into two if we need to. The prayer starts in Nehemiah four, four. This is after a few good insults from sandballot, one dopey insult from Tobiah about fox is knocking over their wall. And Nehemiah says, hear us. Oh, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Okay. That's part one of the prayer. And yeah, that's a pretty aggressive prayer, right? I mean, it's a judo prayer. If you think about it, it's not offensive martial arts where you just go out and karate chop people with judo, where you turn the momentum of the aggressor back on themselves, turn their insults back on their own heads. In other words, there would be no insults to turn back on their own heads. If they weren't initiating the insults. And remember, Nehemiah happens after Esther, just one generation after Esther, the story of Esther and Mordecai and what happened to Haman. All of that stuff is deeply in the storytelling, the narrative DNA of all of Persia. And certainly most of all of the Jewish people. Well, whose gallows did Haman hang upon or whose Pike, you could say, was Haman impaled upon? Well, it's his own. He made those gallows. He made that pike or that spear that he ended up being mounted upon for the whole city to see. He made it for Mordecai. He made it to punish the Jews, but the insult returned on his own head. The aggression turned back on his own head. The vengeance his mind say at the Lord and very dramatically God redirected that evil back on the person who was initiating it. So it makes a ton of sense for Nehemiah to invoke that same spirit of God, that same spirit of justice upon these guys who were acting a little bit Haman-y right now, frankly, give them over his plunder in a land of captivity. I want to totally get into it with the other, I want to turn over. I want to look at Habakkuk. It's a prophet in the Old Testament. It totally relates to this and I got to give it fair time. So hey, we're just going to hit pause there and we will continue breaking down the details of Nehemiah's rather assertive, rather combative sounding prayer next time around. But I again cannot find a lot of fault with Nehemiah. I get to this passage and maybe I've just lived long enough. Maybe I've done enough stupid stuff. Maybe I've seen enough stupid stuff done that at this point in my life, look at that, I'm like, dude, I actually kind of relate to that. I don't feel totally comfortable admitting that into this microphone, but I guess that ship is already sailed. So there you go. Nehemiah is at a very real place and I'm going to take his prayer seriously and we'll look at the next two parts of the thing and break that down. Manana. Finally, I don't know if you heard the other day or not, but the next book of the Bible that we're going to cover, the next season that is, is going to be on the book of Galatians. So we'll be back into the New Testament. We're going to jump forward in time, 500 ish years. We're going to hang out with the Apostle Paul for the first time, get to know him a little bit together. I think it's going to be a ton of fun. Also, I'm excited to mail out our Matthew stickers to everybody who supports the program at any level on any platform. It's not going to take me very long to get this mailing together. We're already gathering details on it. So yeah, the stickers, we got the gold outline stickers. They're special edition limited edition. The only way you can get them is by supporting the program. That's my way of saying thank you for supporting this thing and making it happen. You don't have to do that. It's cool if you don't want to, but it's awesome that some of you do. So thank you. Also, there's a cool hologram, super special edition version that I'm going to send out to a few of you who've gone silly above and beyond. Thank you so much for that. All right, that's plenty. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
