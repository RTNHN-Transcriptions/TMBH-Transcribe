This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and yesterday we started breaking down Nehemiah chapter 8 where the priest Ezra gets up in front of this whole assembly on September 27th, 444 BC and starts reading the book of the law of Moses to them and explaining it to them in a way that I'm guessing didn't sound like just a bunch of yelling and a wall of words. It looks like there's a bunch of cues in the text that there was a lot of intentionality about this because he really wanted them to get it and they seemed really enthusiastic to get it. And so if you haven't listened to yesterday's episode, you go catch that one real quick because we're going to dovetail this one right into it after my close personal friend, Reverend Jeffrey Foote, plays some wholesome music for us to get into it. Nehemiah 8.4, Ezra describes stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right were a whole bunch of people and on his left were a whole bunch of other people. So we got this big dirty platform, there's a whole bunch of people up there. Some of these names would have popped maybe for the initial original audience. Last time around, I noted there were a couple of them who'd come up with another person, Nehemiah, and I hadn't even noticed that until just now. So they obviously don't pop as much for me. But important people are standing up there. This lens legitimacy to the scene. Ezra, I imagine his body language and his facial expression is an eyebrows up in the middle kind of posture, like the friendly eyebrows up in the middle, not the angry eyebrows down in the middle kind of posture. He seems very tender hearted to the people and they seem very tender hearted toward what's going on and toward the law. Verse five, Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them and as he opened it, the people all stood up. Ezra praised the Lord, the great God, and all the people lifted their hands and responded, Amen, Amen, then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground. If I'm reading this right, I don't even think we're into the part yet where the book is actually getting read. I think they're just warming up like this is the text here it is holding it up. And people are celebrating that it's there. Ezra gives some sort of prayer or statement almost like an invocation to say, you know, this is what we're here to do. This is the point. You know, God, some sort of summoning of God's blessing upon the events that are about to unfold. The people are into it. They're saying, Amen, Amen, they were all standing with their hands out to receive metaphorically to assume a posture visually of, we want this, we're ready to receive what you were about to give us. Assuming a right posture is a theme throughout the Bible where the people who assume the right posture before the king, there's something to that, that physical outward appearance of responding rightly to what's going on in front of you is a big thing that seems to be the case here as well. So I'm picturing a scene where you got a grandfatherly figure who has seen a lot. I remember he's made a difficult trip from Persia himself. He risked his name on this. He is sort of the cultural inheritor of the legacy of Mordecai and Esther. He is the inheritor of the legacy of the priests who went back with Zarubah 80, 90 years earlier. He's the inheritor of the legacy of the last of the good priests who were there and serving in the temple before Nebuchadnezzar's conquest and the destruction of the temple. He's sort of the caretaker of the honor, the baton of the role played by the descendants of Moses brother Aaron. He's a very important man, but he doesn't seem haughty. He seems soft-hearted. He's standing up high for everybody to see. I have to think that late September in Jerusalem, things can get pretty toasty. I have to think that that is part of the reason that this event assembled at the Watergate because think about what's going to be at the Watergate. It's right there in the name Doug. Water. People are going to need that real bad as the day is going along and there's a spring. I even have my little map here for which spring it is. There are people who know this and you're yelling it already because you know everything about the geography of the Bible. Okay, I know the pool of Siloane that's way down on the south end of the city down by the dungate because remember like the boot is kicking the dungate. It looks like this would be the gihon. I never know how to say it and I'm always nervous. G-I-H-O-N spring would be right here as well. Therefore as the day gets long and things get hot, people can receive refreshment. They can cool off during this time. This is a very empathetically very thoughtfully put together event. Verse 7, the Levites, Jeshua, Benai, Sarabiah, Jamin, Akub, Shabbatiah, Haudiah, Mahasaya, Kalita, Azariah, Josabad, Hanan and Paliah instructed the people in the law while the people were standing there. They read from the book of the law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was being read. Now this is interesting. It feels almost like what's being described here is a relay system where the crowd is such that Azra maybe can't project in the way he wants to to cover everything or maybe it's even just a matter of his age and the physical demands that it would take to do all of this himself. So the Levites, I mean what's their job? Remember we've talked about this. The temple servants and particularly the Levites, their job is to assist the priests in their duties to prop up and facilitate the activities surrounding the temple. This is awesome. These guys are doing their job and this is a payoff here in verse 7 of a whole bunch of different lists that we get in Nehemiah even just last chapter, chapter 7 and then going back to Ezra. What was that? Chapter 2 we get the list of all of the different people who went back to returning exiles or temple servants, so there were Levites that is to say there was a clear investment in the resources of the returning exiles. I'll say we need these temple servants. We need these Levites who help assist in these things. That's going to pay off. They play a very important role. There's only so much you can ask of the priests. The priests are in limited supply and boom. Here's a pleasant little logistical payoff right here as we get the list of the guys who were able to understand what was being taught in the law, who were able to understand what Ezra was saying and who you kind of get the impression knew their people well enough. Maybe they served different neighborhoods within Jerusalem and the surrounding communities and so maybe they had a little bit more of a sense of how to talk to the people of this family or that family, but it's like they're taking what Ezra is doing and explaining it in a way that people can understand. Preaching in general is incarnational to use very theological terminology. It's you take something that is ordained by God and then you try to articulate it in a way that is going to make sense to everyday people who you know and who know you. Even if a person isn't absolutely perfect at it, I think it's a very noble task and these guys were willing to take that on. Again, they're reading from the book of the law of God, but they're not just reading it. They're also making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people can understand what was being read. So look at all the markers of empathy that we are getting here. You got the platform so that people can see what's going on and track with the body language of the person who's officiating this whole gigantic event. You got this thing situated by the Watergate so people can receive refreshment throughout the day. You got this thing set against the backdrop of the temple. The temple would have been right behind them as they're watching this event unfold as a reminder of all the all the stuff in Deuteronomy and Deuteronomy has got all that language about, you know, but even if years from now you screw all of this stuff up big time paraphrases mind and your hearts are softened toward me and you repent. I'll bring you back to this land. We'll put you back here. We'll get you set up God saying all of that stuff. The fact that the temple is there and that they're by a gate in the rebuilt walls and that a priest descended from all of the line of priests going way back is up there. All of this is a visual reminder of visual. It's a metaphor for the big story beats of the promises of God and what they're looking at in the book of Nehemiah. That is another marker of empathy. So what do we got? We got the stage, we got the water, we got the setting with the walls and the temple right there. We have the care in explanation for the crowd and we have a thoughtfulness about the fact that this gets emphasized repeatedly through Nehemiah 8 that everybody's there and they were trying to make it make sense to everyone who could even possibly understand. Sometimes you go to an event and you get done and you feel like, huh, that was entirely about the person upfront. That was all about things they needed to say or do for their own purposes to look like they did something or were busy or justified their own existence. We all hate going to things like that, whether it's church, business stuff, work stuff, a perfunctory practice for a sports team. These kind of meetings are stupid and they don't provide any value to the person who is having to sit through the whole thing. But we've all gone to something where clearly the point of the exercise was for me the attendee to get it, to understand it, to own it, to have this thing in my hip pocket and walk away built up, to walk away knowing new things I didn't know before, to walk away really grasping the point so I can take that with me and do something with it in my life. And this is one of those kinds of events where tremendous thoughtfulness seems to be put into it so that people will get it and it'll give it the best chance possible of sticking. We are going to look at how more of this plays out, how the people respond starting in verse nine next time around. Thank you again so much to everyone who's taken the time to go and subscribe to the new YouTube channel that is this podcast, the 10 minute Bible hour on YouTube. That is a big help and I greatly appreciate it. If it doesn't make sense to do that, don't feel bad or weird. You totally don't have to. All right, y'all are awesome. I'm Matt.
