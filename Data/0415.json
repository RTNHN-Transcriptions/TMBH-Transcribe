It's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. There's this friend I had in college and on past college who was fun to play sports with, you know, good athlete, pretty good sport most of the time, but he would do this thing when he was a little outmatched, depending on the quality of the court. If we were playing basketball or whatever sport we might have been playing where he'd do the thing, he was like, oh, I'm a little injured, take it a little bit easy on me. And then if we got too physical or shoved him around, he would remind us that we need to take a little bit easy on him because he's a bit banged up. And then one time, one of the other guys in our circle of pickup game players brought a couple of younger kids, maybe high school, middle school, something like that, and like, hey, do you mind if they jump in? And we're like, yeah, yeah, sure. And everybody kind of knew what to do except Mr. take it easy on me because I get a little bit banged up sometimes. This guy went really hard on the kids, flexed on him a couple times, blocked a couple shots. And finally everybody was like, dude, you can't, like, you can't want us to not play physically against you if you're going to play physically against little children. But if you can understand that little social anecdote, then you're super double triple extra more going to understand this incredibly clear, better example that Jesus uses to illustrate his point about if you're given grace, you got to give grace away. The situation is this, we're in Matthew chapter 18, Jesus just got done explaining what you're supposed to do, what steps you're supposed to go through. Somebody does something wrong in church or if things get sideways relationally in church. And then Peter wanting to demonstrate that he's on board with the teacher, the person who's in charge of the room comes to Jesus in verse 21. He says, Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me up to seven times? And this really was a very forward thinking thing for him to say. It's like, well, you know, the text that usually the religious leaders of the day would draw on to answer this question. They'd say, well, you know, three times, maybe up to four, maybe. And so Peter is saying like three plus four seven, which is pretty cool. But Jesus takes it even further. And he answers, I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times or 70 times seven. It's rendered sometimes and he goes into this parable that's better than the lame one that I opened with and goes like this. Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. And he talked yesterday about the introduction here being the kingdom of heaven is like. That's reminiscent of the kingdom parables formula of Matthew chapter 13. And here we have a king who is wanting to square things up with those servants who are doing some sort of business in his name or business with him. In this case, it looks like debts. Verse 24 says, as he began the settlement, a man who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him. I do not know off the top of my head what a talent is. I suppose I could have Googled that and then just impressed you by being like, this is how much it is. But I actually have no idea. And so I am Googling it right now. And that's why I'm stalling and buffering and you're all listening trick to you. Okay, 75 pounds is what this is saying. The measure of weight around 75 pounds, dang, that is a lot. So a talent, it doesn't say what kind of metal, but let's say it is a talent of silver. Okay, 75 pounds times 16 ounces. That's how many is in a pound. I do happen to know the current price of silver is around 26 bucks. Oh, yeah. So that's a lot like 31 grand. Oh, no, but it's 10,000. That was for one talent times 10,000. Whoo. Okay. Yep. That's a lot of money. $1,000,000 if we go by modern silver values. Okay. I guess he probably wasn't able to pay it back. So then in verse 25, it says, since he wasn't able to pay the master, the 312 mill that he owed him casually, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt, which is not even going to come close. So then in light of the 312 million figure, the servant does the only thing that makes sense, which is beg. You're never going to get an audience with this master ever again. You're never getting out of jail ever. I mean, you're not going to earn $312 million walking around town with all your freedom, let alone $312 million sitting in jail. So this is your one chance the debtor recognizes the opportunity and he goes big, be patient with me. He begged and I will pay you back everything. Now, if I'm the master here, I guess I have a follow up question and that is really, really if I'm just patient with you, you're going to come up with a third of a bill. Come on, man. I don't think that's going to happen. There's no way it's an incalculable figure and this guy is begging and pleading. Maybe he's trying to buy time, but weirdly, verse 27, the servants master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. We learn a lot about the master in that one little verse one. He can afford to forgive $312 million. So this king, this master has unending riches. If he can just write that off and call it as a loss, a suggestion of kindness to someone who really wasn't that good to me anyway. And that brings us to a second thing that we learn about this guy, which is that apparently you don't have to be that awesome for him to be merciful to you. Because if he's $312 million nice to this guy, I mean, how much nicer would he be to somebody who actually impressed him and who he got along with? So not only is this master incredibly generous with his money, he's got an unbelievable resources but he has an unbelievable reservoir of patience and not just for people who could give him something back, which I suppose is the third thing we learn about the master here. There's really not much you can give somebody who has resources to draw on like this. Compliments aren't going to work. This person's been complimented for a long time. They've heard it all. There's nothing you can buy with money that this guy couldn't buy with money. There's no security that you could give this guy that he couldn't get himself. There's no smarts or intelligence. You can't crack a code better than this king, this master has cracked the code. So he's definitely in the position of strength here, but weirdly he's giving an audience to this little guy. He listened to this little guy beg and his heart was soft toward this little guy and he let him off the hook out of empathy and kindness toward him or toward his family or toward everybody. This is a wildly generous, wildly good king. Then we get the twist of the parable in verse 28 says, but when that servant, the one who owed all the money went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denary. And guess what? I also don't know how much a denary is and I also could have googled that, which I am doing now. Looks like that's about a day's wage. So let's say that a day's wage is, let's just make the math easy. We're going to say a hundred bucks. So dude earns a hundred bucks and what does he owed here? A hundred denary. Oh, that was pretty, a hundred times a hundred equals $10,000. So it's still a pretty nice chunk of money, I suppose, but it's not a third of a billion. And dude has no patience. He grabbed him and began to choke the one who owed him. Pay me back what you owe me. He demanded his fellow servant, fell to his knees. A little bit of the, it's like poetry, a rhymes thing going on here. This is the same exact thing that happened when the other guy was in daddy, he falls to his knees and he begs him, be patient with me and I will pay you back. Be patient with me. He begged and I will pay you back everything. So they have the same plea. They assume the same posture before the person they owe. And so you would think the person who just got forgiven $312 million would be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, somebody just let me off the hook for $312 million. Honestly, if you can't get me back right now or ever, I think that's the least I can do all the best. But we get a further twist. He refused. Instead, he, the servant who got forgiven a ton, went off and had the man who owed a little bit thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened. Then the master called the servant in, a wicked servant, he said, I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Didn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you? And in anger, his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed. And so it's important to note at the tail end of this story that the servant who was forgiven much did not just get the same punishment he was going to get. He got a worse punishment than he was going to get because he got showed so much forgiveness, so much mercy and couldn't muster even a little modicum of mercy in light of what he'd been shown. That's a breakdown of the story next time around. We're going to break down the theology of the story and figure out how it fits into this whole bigger thing, especially the whole speech we're getting in Matthew chapter 18. I talked to the people from Africa Renewal at africarenewal.org slash TmbH the other day. And it was really fun to hear about how many of you have jumped in to sponsor a kid in Uganda. Uganda, however, is going back under some kind of lockdown right now. So they've got it particularly tough and it looks like Africa Renewal is going to be doing what they do best, which is thinking on their feet and meeting the needs of an ever changing situation. The reality is a whole bunch of you just made that a whole lot easier by sponsoring a kid through Africa Renewal. And so I just want to say thanks for doing that. If that's something you're still thinking about straight up, I'm asking you to think about it and maybe even give it a go. Again, you can learn more about that at africarenewal.org slash TmbH.
