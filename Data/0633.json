This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Kiafis is the high priest. He's the guy in charge of the whole religious pyramid during the time of Jesus that is decided that it would be much better if Jesus were dead. So I thought it would be fun to be like, wow, I see him as important. We should try to figure out what makes him tick. And that's what we've been doing the last few days. And I'm having a lovely time with it. And where we left off yesterday was we had just finished up a kind of a big historical survey from the beginning of the high priesthood in the earliest days of the Old Testament, not quite the earliest, but way back in the Old Testament. Looking at that going all the way up to the time of the Greek overlords, the generals who succeeded Alexander the Great and tried to Greekify the Jewish people and how part of that Greekification or Hellenization impulse that the Greek overlords inflicted on the Jewish people was to have those Greek overlords start choosing high priests themselves as opposed to from their Levitical tribe of Levi heritage. And I guess we haven't just overtly made that connection, but you know, the book of Leviticus in the Old Testament and how it's about like what the priests do and all the sacrificial stuff and all of that and clean and unclean business. Because it's like Leviticus Levi's. He it's like the stuff that the priests would worry about. I'll just fits together. I'm making the gesture with my fingers where I put my fingers in between my other fingers. And then I say, it all just fits together and I smile and I feel really good inside. I hope that it helped you be able to picture that. All of that to say now we're in the second century BC and we got a problem because the high priesthood has been messed with. It's been disrupted. It's been politicized. It's been bastardized in the minds of many. And what do you do? I mean, it's become hereditary at this point. Well, do you disrupt this new religious dynasty? I hear everybody saying dynasty now. I'm trying it out. I don't know. I still like dynasty. But then that sounds like that that show from the eighties like that prime time. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just I'm going to keep going with dynasty. It still sounds right to me. I can't I'm not classy enough. I can't bring myself to it. So what do you do? Do you disrupt this religious dynasty or do you try to tap back into the whole Levitical thing? It looks like there's an impulse to try both. But ultimately the Maccabean kingdom that the Jewish people put together in the mid-second century BC in place of their Greek overlords, they deposed. Their system is pretty corrupt and it's a political mess from the very early going. And the high priesthood, it's solid. It just never seems to feel the same after this moment. It's not even really a hundred years and the Romans come along and start inflicting their influence on the entire Mediterranean world. And Judea is ripe for the picking and eventually Nius Pompey, Magnus, the great general, the buddy of Julius Caesar comes along and again, quote unquote, liberates Jerusalem and gradually Judea becomes a client state, a subject state of the Romans where you have local rulers called ethnarchs. This is the Herod family working in concert with ethnically Roman governors like Pontius Pilate. And it looks like during the Roman era, the high priesthood, it was something that the Romans saw the importance of and they wanted to get that on a leash. And so a whole bunch of deals got struck to put certain families in charge that caused a degree of resentment. But also the high priesthood was representative of like the point of historical connection for Judaism going all the way back. Then there were some Levitical overtones that I think were enough for people to feel good enough about it. But biblically and extra biblically, it's also pretty evident that people didn't feel great about the system they had in place here. They felt the burden of extra religious expectation. And I think those leaders who were a part of this religious structure, if we're to think of them in the most sympathetic of terms and given the most benefit of the doubt, they're looking at that big ugly hideous story that I just told you and they're like, that happened because we didn't honor God's law. And so we've got to honor it way more tightly. People's individual behavior, even in the privacy of their own homes or their own handwashing or whatever, that has a national effect. And now we're under the thumb of the Romans. And that's because people didn't honor God enough in these detailed ways. And so we are going to make sure that we make rules on top of rules to get this stuff right, trying to learn the lessons of the people who came before us. Well, then Jesus comes along and he's like, you, you didn't learn the right lesson. The right lesson is God wants your heart. God wants you to be a, a bot in participant in his kingdom who loves the things that he loves and all the stuff we've talked about with the values of the kingdom. On the other hand, to look at these religious leaders and the least sympathetic light possible would be to say they were stool pigeons of the Romans while holding themselves out as being ardently defiant of the Romans. This is an old political trick and we shouldn't underestimate the reality of this. Oh, that said, back to Kiafis, this guy is going to be feeling the weight of all of the chief priests who have come before him. He's also going to be feeling the weight of family dynasty. He is the son-in-law and successor of the previous high priest, Anis, who still casts a very long shadow over what's going on. And in addition to that family pressure and that historical religious pressure, some of which may have been well-founded and even noble, he's also got political pressure because he's got to keep the Romans happy. He's got to keep the ethnarchs happy and he wants to keep his people from rebelling. So he wants to push back on the various messianic claimants who come along and the more zealous groups within Jewish society want to get rid of the Romans because if the Romans get overturned or if there's a rebellion, even one that fails against them, that's going to be disastrous for the Roman appointed leadership, both secular and religious in Jerusalem. And at this point, Kiafis and the Roman governor Pontius Pilate and the members of the Herod family who were in charge, they all know this thing is a powder keg and that anything can set it off. Are they concerned then with justice for Jesus of Nazareth, some homeless guy from up north? No. It's one guy, small price to pay to keep things together and maintain their family interests. Are they concerned at all with doing what's, you know, like right because it's what God wants? Well, yeah, doing what God wants is one in the same with their position. They don't have to think about it anymore. Anyone who would in any way threaten or oppose the position of high priest is therefore automatically bad. And so there isn't a lot of moral complexity to this equation for them. It's pretty easy in that regard. Defending the institution is defending God. But what if Kiafis had been like Nicodemus, the religious leader we meet over in the book of John, you know, where we get the famous John chapter three and where Jesus explains how much God loved the world and he gave his only son and all of that business. And then, you know, Nicodemus converts, what if Kiafis had had an experience like that or Anas had had an experience like that? What could he have done? Whew, it'd be tough. His hands are pretty tied institutionally and the fallout and the betrayal and the injury he would inflict on so many people who were counting on him would have been massive. If I am to be as objective and fair as possible in evaluating Kiafis's options in this situation, I really think he'd already painted himself into a corner with a whole bunch of little decisions that he had made and a whole bunch of little decisions that people had made before him. Well, the way this high priesthood thing plays out is that it really only has another couple decades of legs left to it after the execution of Jesus because ultimately there is a rebellion. The powder keg does get ignited. And when that goes off, it is utterly calamitous and the priestly sacrificial Levitical system effectively goes away. My understanding is that the chief priest thing, as we know it from distant history, as it was known in the time of Jesus effectively goes away with the rebellion in 70 AD, meaning that in the convenience and simplicity and ease of history and hindsight, we can look back and say, look, even if Kiafis didn't have a lot of plays available to him, it looks like the ones he made still probably were not the right plays. In the grand scheme of things, the Bible says he did exactly what he was supposed to do because Jesus had to go to the cross. He said it was going to happen and the entire redemptive plan hinges on him going and being given up as a sacrifice in that way and being brought back to life on the third day. There, we talked about Kiafis. I feel like we just got done with one of those episode five or episode six flashback, make the bad guy a little more sympathetic episodes that you get in from a streaming TV service. I mean, it wasn't quite as well written or is tightly executed, but I've had a lovely time and I hope you have to on with the story next time around. I'm Matt.
