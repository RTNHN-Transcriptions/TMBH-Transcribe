And it wasn't like a whole kids kind of laughing that we did. It was like legitimate laughing because it was super funny. And I don't know if that kiddo has ever pulled that off before. But you know where this story is going when that happens and a kid makes joke work, you know what they're going to do. They're going to go right back and keep pushing that button again and again and again and again. And the kiddo did exactly that. And you don't want to tell them like, Oh, it was only funny the first couple of times and they don't understand the concept of endurance humor yet. Just grinding that joke into the dust until it travels the full joke arc from funny to miserably unfunny to funny again. But I get it. They pushed the button with the joke and the joke hit and they liked the way that felt and they just figured, well, you just push the button again and then you should get the same exact result that you got the last time you pushed the button. But that wasn't how the thing works. And we all understand that. Likewise, when we look at the story of the temple in the Old Testament, it makes perfect sense that given that very metaphorically speaking here, there was a button they got pushed with the dedication of the tabernacle. It's the tent where they did sacrifices and where God dwelt among the Israelite people. They pushed the button and God's spirit showed up and then they probably felt like, Oh, and now we got Solomon's temple built and then they did a dedication and vastly metaphorically stretch speaking. They pushed the button again and the spirit of God showed up again. None of this is a suggest that I think God just does whatever the people want or that that's what the text is suggesting. And I think you see where I'm going. And so it makes sense then that after that temple gets destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in the 500s BC and then the Persians topple Nebuchadnezzar's descendants and the Babylonians and now Cyrus, the great is in charge and Cyrus sends the people of Israel back to Jerusalem to rebuild their temple and they do lay the foundations of the temple and they get started. You would expect that they would just go back and try to hit the same humor note. They would go back and try to hit the same button again, like this work before it should work again. And that brings us to the book of Ezra where we get the answer as to whether or not it does work again, but you're smart and you know, I wouldn't be using an analogy where my kid cracked a joke and then it quit working after the first try. If the temple dedication was going to work out the same way it worked out the first couple times around. Here's what went down. We get into the book of Ezra and they got a bunch of money and they get cracking on laying this foundation and Ezra three reads thusly versus seven through nine. Give a little bit of the story of how they get the money together and they got the lumber from Lebanon. They're doing all the stuff that looks a lot like how they did it last time. So they're kind of pushing that button again. And then verse 10, when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, the priests in their vestments and with trumpets and the Levites, the sons of Asaph with symbols, took their places to praise the Lord as prescribed by David King of Israel with praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord. He is good. His love to Israel endures forever, which is exactly the same kind of stuff they said last time they dedicated a temple and they're following the manual that was given to them by David. This ought to work. We did this before. We got a certain result from God. Now, this isn't the dedication of the temple. This is just the account of the getting started on the foundation part in Ezra three, but already something is off. This doesn't feel like last time. This doesn't feel like the last temple. Obviously nobody who was there for the dedication of the last temple is here for this dedication. You're talking about 500 years of time that has elapsed between the two, but there are people here who still remembered what the old temple looked like in its glory before it got torn down. And that leads us into this little detail and all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. But verse 12, many of the older priests and Levites and family heads who had seen the former temple wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid while many others shouted for joy. No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping because the people made so much noise and the sound was heard far away. In other words, even though the youngsters who were born in captivity and have only ever known captivity and didn't know what the temple was like or fully what it meant, they're like, yeah, we made a long road trip. We got money. We're building the thing and they're right to be excited. That's really cool. But the folks who much like the family in that Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara sitcom, I was talking about a couple of days ago, much like they knew what real splendor was and now the little victories are kind of hard to savor. So these people who saw the glory of the old temple are like, Oh, no, that's it. That's what we can afford. That's what the new thing is going to be. And from the get go, it feels like this is not quite the same proposition that it's been in the past. And so there's a bitter sweetness here. Joy, it getting cracking on getting this thing built again, but sorrow at the realization that is probably never going to be the way it was. Well, there's still the one thing hanging out there. What's going to happen when they actually finish it and dedicate it and start doing all of the temple sacrificial stuff in the normal way that it would have been done before it was torn down by Nebuchadnezzar. Will God show up the way he did before or will he not if we push the buttons and do all the right things and recite the same Psalms and have the same ceremonies? Is it going to work? Short answer is no, it's not going to work. And whereas both kings and chronicles give us a massive description of the dedication of Solomon's temple and give us specific unique details about how God's spirit showed up, some that we get in kings, some that we get in chronicles, as opposed to the pages and pages and pages of material we get in kings and chronicles about the first dedication. Here is all the second dedication inspired Ezra to include Ezra 616, then the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy. For the dedication of this house of God, they offered a hundred bowls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel. And they installed the priests and their divisions and the Levites and their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in the book of Moses the end. This is a different time. This is a different economic reality. The sacrifices are comfortably two hundred times smaller than what had happened at the first dedication. The sacrifices, the sacrifices, the real main event here, the real highlight, the real question, the real point of tension is will God show up? And maybe he did, but he doesn't make it physically evident. Or if so, Ezra left it out of his book, but why would Ezra leave that out of his book? It would be incredibly important to the people involved to know that God did show up and that this is precisely a continuation of what happened with the tabernacle and the first temple. No, instead, there's just a passing acknowledgement that there was a dedication, that we didn't really have a ton of money to sacrifice a lot of animals or anything. And glaringly absent once again from this account is any notation of the supernatural and physically obvious arrival of God. Now this takes us into a new chapter in the history of the temple. There's a temple again, but is it really like before? Is it occupied like before? Does it mean the same thing as before? If not, what do we still lack? What haven't we done here to get this thing where it needs to be, to get our hearts where it needs to be? Why isn't this working? My joke hit the first couple of times. And so I said it again, and it's not hitting now. And the same kind of confusion that a kid has when they're understandably learning the tricky art of humor and they don't know why it's not working anymore seems to be present here, but on a much more weighty grander scale. We'll talk about how this bittersweet arrival of the second temple and this bittersweet dedication of the second temple affects the mentality and the religion of the Jewish people moving forward toward the time of Christ next time around.
