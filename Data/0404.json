This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and disclaimer right up front that clicking sound right there. It's my Ricola cough drop. This episode is not brought to you by Ricola in any way, shape and form, but it should be because these cough drops really help. I've got this dumb seasonal allergy cough thing. It doesn't do anything, but if I sit in a room with any kind of air conditioning, it makes it impossible to have a normal human conversation. It's like every two seconds you want to seize up and do this meaningless cough. So hey, cough drops a hoy. We're just going to do this thing. Thanks in advance for indulging my disgusting mouth noises. Having said that, we are talking about Matthew 18. Matthew 18 is the chapter that contains the fourth of the five great big speeches of Jesus around which the book of Matthew is structured as we've been talking about. And this one has a bunch of different names. It's kind of funny. The sermon on the Mount. It's just the sermon on the Mount. Matthew five through seven. Everybody calls it the same thing, but this one you'll hear talked about is like the church discourse, the family of faith discourse. Anybody say that? No, that's just my term. The community discourse. You hear that one a lot. I don't think I even brought that one up yesterday. Maybe that's the most popular. I don't know. Whatever the case, it's the one in Matthew chapter 18 where Jesus talks about the church what it looks like for somebody who is a part of the kingdom, a son, a daughter, a child, an agent, an heir of the kingdom to live out their relationships within the community of faith within this new family of faith in such a way that they do right by other people, that they honor God and that outsiders can look at it and be like, Oh, that's very, very compelling because it's so weird and different and beautiful. I think I would rather live in a kingdom with those values than to continue to operate under the normal default setting of world values that I operate under. In Matthew chapter 10, Jesus outlines the message they're being sent out with. It's the same one that John the Baptist said back in chapter three, it's repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand, which sounds like it's not really much of a message, but there's quite a bit there. That message assumes that humanity is getting things wrong, but the imminence of what God is about to do should give us a sense of urgency to reframe that getting it wrong into some new way. And if people heard that message and they were like, cool, I want to, but I don't know exactly what that means. They might ask questions similar to what God asked of John the Baptist back there in chapter three and all these different groups are recorded as coming to John the Baptist and be like, Okay, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. All right, but I'm a plumber. What does that mean for me? And then John the Baptist is like, well, plumb like this, then another people are like, I am an accountant. Well, account like this, then. And other people were like, I am a professional hand model. Well, then hand model thusly. What we see is that in every profession that comes to him and asks, what does this look like? It would seem that justice and integrity and kingdom values are what he points them back toward. Then we go from that vague message of John the Baptist to something that puts a little more flesh on it in the sermon on the Mount, chapters five through seven. Here are what these values look like. Then in chapter 10, in the second great discourse, this being the missional discourse, we see that the message is reiterated, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand, but also it's backed up by the miraculous power of God. Then in chapter 13, we get more details about how this thing is supposed to just be indiscriminately scattered everywhere is it go tell people about what this message is. It's going to grow up in ways that look weird and clumsy to you, but don't worry. God's got it covered. The kingdom is going to grow up in ways that some people really obviously notice in other ways, it's going to look like this tiny little thing that's doing nothing, but it's growing up and it's becoming gigantic. And so the attentive reader now, the original audience then, the disciples, the squishy middle crowd who are following Jesus around, all of them would have had that stuff in the back of their brains. They're still thinking about it. And then we get to chapter 18 and we discover that, oh, there is a second prong to this approach to showing the world what the kingdom is about. One is this message, the seed, the repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand, the articulation of the values of the kingdom, that is half of what the followers of Jesus are equipped with to go out into the world and to duplicate the kingdom and to quote Matthew 13 to give away the values of the kingdom and to see that duplicated 30, 60, 100 times over. But when we get to chapter 18, we discovered that there is a second prong to this that Jesus, the king is ordaining for his kingdom citizens. And that is just how you are, how you are with each other is going to be apparently very, very important to how this all works out. And thus we get the community life discourse and I'm going to digress for a moment. This turned out to be true. If you go and dig deep and we'll do some of that in coming episodes into why Christianity caught on so much in the first and second century, what you find is that overwhelmingly it was people following what we are about to work our way through in the upcoming days and weeks. People who followed Jesus did this stuff and it was weird. And this stuff in terms of how they treated each other in terms of how they thought of their possessions and how they thought about the value of other people, that was weird. It was counter cultural. It was transformative. It was not the norm and it was wildly attractive. This is going to sound like a slight critique of church now because it is. I don't think Christianity does this as well anymore. I think Christians have done a pretty good job over the centuries of handing down the basic principles of like be nice to people and don't be mean. Like the basic individual piety stuff that we're going to see in chapter 18 has passed down through the ages pretty well. I think the revolutionary different lifestyle that stands in stark relief against the normal default way to do life in the world and the normal default way to do relationships. I don't think most Christians have had the clarity or the courage to do this. And I'm in a phase right now where I'm a little discouraged. I'm a little frustrated that there doesn't seem to be this clear, very different expression of Christian life and community that exists in the conversation right now. If there were something happening right now that were as wildly counter cultural that scratched every deep abiding itch that is placed there by our maker and our designer God, I think the conversation would look a lot different right now in terms of the gospel and church and where it's all at. But I don't think right now most outsiders to the faith, including a whole bunch of you who I know are here having this conversation. I don't think a ton of people look in from the outside and are like, dang, that is way different. Whether it's a result of bad press or poor execution on the part of the church, some combination of the two, I think most people outside the church, at least in the Western world right now would look at the church as just another special interest group that is trying to get certain policies in place and that is trying to protect their base and to win whatever this silly culture war thing is that we're doing. And maybe that's all terribly, terribly important. But as we work through chapter 18, I think what you're going to see is that it doesn't seem to be the driving agenda here. The driving agenda here is entirely inwardly focused. This whole game plan we're going to look at smacks in a lot of ways of the Abrahamic Covenant all the way back to the beginning of the Old Testament. You're going to be this people. Here's something that's very focused on the descendants of Abraham. But then right at the end, there's this thing about you're going to be blessed and all the nations will be blessed through you. Well, Jesus is making a new family of faith here. This new family of faith has a way that it's going to do things. I mean, it's a covenant family. This new family of faith is set aside. This new family of faith has unique kingdom values. This new family of faith is built to get things right internally with each other, which then, just like the Abrahamic thing, becomes a blessing to people outside of it. But as we go through chapter 18, I think we might have the temptation to look at this and say, this is a personal piety chapter about how each one of us as individuals, if we believe the Jesus kingdom message stuff, this is how each one of us should individually behave because naughty and nice. And do you want to be mean and naughty to God? After all, he's done. Wouldn't you want to be nice and well behaved? Do you want God's approval? Do you want this millstone stuff? And while yes, that individual level is there, the text is also obviously indicating that there's something much bigger at stake. And that is that how this new family of faith, how the kingdom citizens do their business relationally, how they treat each other is part of the message, is part of how they go and spread the seed to draw on the chapter 13 parable metaphor. The stakes are much higher than just personal naughty and nice, personally receiving approval from God or correction from God. The stakes are the fate of others. This is how other people are supposed to look at the transformative power of the kingdom of God and the superiority of the values of the kingdom and be like, whoa, oh, I can picture it now. Okay, well, I would want to do that. And Jesus told people to count the cost. Well, part of counting the cost is I need to be able to see somewhere how this works. It was it looked like when people believe this and they think Jesus is the son of God and the Messiah and the Christ and King and they believe in his teachings. Is that different? Do people dress differently? Do they build different kinds of houses? What is it like when they go to work? How do they talk to each other? What do they do when they get into a fight? Is any of it different than what we already do? And if so, how? And is it beautiful? Is it better? This discourse in chapter 18 then could in a way even be called the proof of concept discourse. Don't just do this because of Nadia and Nice and because you want the approval of God because who doesn't do this also as you imitate the humble servant generous attitude, patient attitude of Jesus toward others. But even beyond that level of just doing kindness to others, you're also illustrating what the kingdom is and what the kingdom values are all about for everybody to see. And with that, we'll call it a day. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
