It's a Star Wars TV show and if you're not into Star Wars, just keep listening. Don't worry, this isn't going to take very long. I think it'll be helpful whether you've ever heard of this or care about it or not. I do care about it. I have a love-hate relationship with Star Wars. It's been around since basically I was a little kid. Star Wars and I started it about the same time and it's been fun to watch that. Mythology unfold, sometimes very discouraging and disappointing. Other times, triumphant and just a blast and something I can share with the kids. Star Wars has been flagging pretty hard for the last 10 or so years, but then a show came out a few years back called The Mandalorian. People seem to really like The Mandalorian. It's a space western with a cowboy character who goes around and dishes out justice. When he goes into the space saloons, you can almost hear his spurs jingle and the musical theme is evocative of the good, the bad and the ugly. It was just a blast. Season 1 was super, super fun and I straight up recommend it, which I usually hesitate to do to anyone and everyone, whether you're into Star Wars or not. It was delightful. It's that rogue with a heart of gold goes to look after someone who needs his protection and discovers something new and softer about himself. It's fun. Season 2 was fine. Season 3 was maybe not quite as cool, but what I did like about Season 3, it just wrapped up and this is where I relates to the stuff that you and I are talking about here with Esther and everything. In Season 3, they are laying it on thick that the whole show is an allegory for what we're looking at here with the Jews in exile. See, there's these people from this planet called Mandalore. They're Mandalorians. That's the name of the show. And Mandalore ran afoul of the great big grand empire. In this case, I suppose it would be a metaphor for Babylon. And so the empire comes along and destroys the planet of Mandalore, wipes out most of the people and destroys their central religious hub building there as well. And whatever's left of the Mandalorians, they scatter to the ends of the galaxy and some of them are all cynical. I'm like, gosh, forget it. Let's just blend in with the culture of our new overlords and others, hold fast to the old religious ways of the planet Mandalore and they believe in prophecies and predictions that one day they will return and rebuild their planet, including this main religious center that is analogous to the temple here in the Old Testament. And just in case you think I'm making this up, by the way, it's actually spelled out somewhat explicitly. There's one little moment where you see an artifact from Mandalore. It has some space lettering on it, which is translatable. I mean, people on the internet do this thing for a living and they went and I wonder what that little space trinket says there in the Mandalorian. They translated it's Exodus chapter 10. Exodus is in Star Wars. The Bible is in Star Wars. How weird is that, right? I don't know what that all means, but what I do know is that means that they're making it really clear. Like, no, if you're catching Jewish overtones in terms of the exile period in Babylon and Persia and the return that finally happens and the triumph of that return. If you're catching those kinds of hints with what we're doing with this space Western TV show, then you are picking up what we are putting down with the Mandalorian because indeed that is intentional. And indeed, as you watch the show, you find yourself rooting hardcore for these people to get out of exile, to come together, overcome differences and go and rebuild a thing that was maybe beautiful once upon a time. You're rooting for them to put it back together. And likewise, even if you don't think that there's a God and you're not really into the theology part of the stuff that we're looking at in the Bible, I mean, I think there's a God. But I know many of you who listen, you're not persuaded of that. But either way, whether you're like me or whether you're like you, either way, you're rooting for the underdog in these kinds of stories. You're rooting for people to overcome past oppression and horrible things. You're rooting for the not extinction of a people group because we like people groups. And so when we get to the end of second Chronicles in the beginning of the book of Ezra, we get this celebratory moment where it looks like everything is ruined. But then the scattered remnant finally is allowed to go back home and start rebuilding. And it's this massive note of optimism and hope that we talked about at the end of second Chronicles last time around. And I told you last time around that all you got to do is turn the page from the end of second Chronicles to the very next book in the first chapter of Ezra. And you see that this edict that was issued by Cyrus the Great First King of the Persian Empire, this edict was a really big deal for the people of Israel, not just because of what it did, but the words itself, they viewed as somehow being providentially ordained by God. Prophets from centuries past had predicted that this moment would come that by name, a guy named Cyrus would come and be used by God to let the people go from exile in Persia and to return and to rebuild. And so the opening lines of Ezra go like this, and if it sounds familiar, it's because it's basically the exact same thing as the closing lines of second Chronicles. In the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, that's the prophet who said before any of this stuff ever went down before the exile ever happened. He was like, Hey, God told me that we're going to go into exile and you're going to need to go there and you're going to need to live faithfully and trust that God still has good plans for you as a people and that things are somehow going to work out. But the punishment is coming. You are going to be defeated by Babylon. So that's the Jeremiah we're talking about. The Lord moved the heart of Cyrus, King of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing. This is such an important theological element whenever Cyrus is coming up throughout the Old Testament. He gets mentioned north of 30 times. And so often this theme of Cyrus is the servant of God without even knowing what he's doing is there whenever Cyrus gets mentioned. We don't get this as much with other kings. The idea is always there throughout the Bible that kings think they're all that, but they're actually clowns and God is the actual king. Even when he's totally unseen and unacknowledged, he directs the hearts of kings like a water course. God is completely and totally in charge. The rival to God's kingdom, which is human government is no real rival at all. And so both at the end of second Chronicles in here at the beginning of Ezra and over in Isaiah as well, it's very heavily spelled out that this wasn't really totally of Cyrus is doing even though he signed the sheet of paper etched the cuneiform little etching stick. It was really the work of God who ordained all of this and providentially pulled together all these disparate threads of this tapestry of a story that we've been looking at that involves the stiages in our pagus and Nebuchadnezzar and the Medes and the Assyrians and the battle of car commission, all these other things. The Bible holds all of that stuff out as being providentially perfectly worked together to get us to Cyrus who for whatever reason in the same way that God for whatever reason chose Abraham and for whatever reason chose Moses. Now he's for whatever reason choosing Cyrus is like this guy is going to be my instrument to do the thing that I wanted to do and to fulfill the prophecies that I've put forward about life after exile. So picking it back up in Ezra, this is what Cyrus king of Persia says. The Lord the God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Anyone of his people among you may his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the Lord the God of Israel and the God who is in Jerusalem. And the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold with goods and livestock and with free will offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem. Now if you remember yesterday there wasn't quite that much detail in what the chronicler recorded at the end of second Chronicles. All we got there was the first part of the decree that takes us up to the point of saying hey let him go up and that gives me the impression that what the chronicler was trying to do part of the motivation in writing first and second Chronicles was to write to the people in exile who were like well should we stick around here and be Persian or should we go back and rebuild this thing. I mean who are we now we've been here for a couple of generations. What do we do? It looks like there's a persuasive element to first and second Chronicles to try to motivate the people of the time to go and be a part of this rebuilding thing. And the book of Ezra is being written after the temple has been rebuilt after people have returned 80 or so years after the initial decree and Ezra seems to be really interested in stressing the idea of being holy and set apart for God. Let's not squander this opportunity because what God has providentially put together for us let's nail it on all the stuff that we got wrong before. So Ezra is going to recount all of the details of how unlikely this amazing reversal of fortune is so that the people who read it again 80 or 100 years after the edict was initially given will see that and be like whoa we cannot squander this. This is such a unique opportunity that we have here we have to keep this thing we have to seize on this chance that God has given us. And so I think that's part of why Ezra gives us the rest or more of the decree of Cyrus and in doing so he answers the question how are we going to pay for a temple right like it's one thing for Cyrus to say I grant you leave to go do it. Good luck building temples I've been told it's pretty pricey but you know I hope it works out for y'all let's see how that goes. No Cyrus specified how it was to be paid for as well and it's very reminiscent of that plundering of the Egyptians that happened in the book of Exodus during the Exodus you recall that when the Hebrew people were leaving they just asked all of their masters for their stuff and everybody's like yeah sure here's like clothes money and stuff is that enough do you want more and so in doing so the Hebrew people plundered the Egyptians on the way out the door and here there isn't quite the spike the football ha ha take that Persia kind of tone that you get in regards to Egypt and Exodus but it's certainly a reminder that hey the God who led you out of slavery in Egypt and met your needs even when it seemed like there was no way for those needs to be met that same God is the one who's at work here and he behaves the same way in this situation as he was behaving in that situation and so Cyrus here by the prompting of God issues as edict for the temple not just to be allowed to be rebuilt but to be paid for in the same way that when you watch through the Star Wars show the Mandalorian you can't help but find yourself rooting for the exiles to put it all back together and to pull together the last little bits of the remnant and to become a people again and to preserve this thing maybe get one more shot at getting right what they got wrong in the past in the same way that's a very satisfying story there so it's a really satisfying story here you're rooting for these people whether you understand all of the theology about it or not yet they went through a horrible calamity and part of their own making and part inflicted upon them but now the land has had rest like we talked about yesterday now it's a new day and there's a fresh opportunity and maybe redemption is at hand and indeed the book of Ezra opens up with the suggestion that it is at hand and this long awaited good outcome is now about to happen very fun more on this manana amat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again soon. you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.84, "text": " Hey, have you all seen The Mandalorian?", "tokens": [50363, 14690, 11, 423, 345, 477,
