This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. And yesterday we started listening to a curious recording that I was able to procure from a first century Applebee's where a Pharisee named Jeff is hanging out with a really good listener friend named Mike. And Jeff, it sounds like he's just trying to process over a few drinks. Something that went down in terms of how the relationship between he and his buddies and Jesus of Nazareth fell apart. So we cut it off right in the middle because it's a long recording. We're just going to pick it up where it left off and get the Pharisee version of events about how this relationship went sideways. If you didn't listen to the episode yesterday, you're probably going to want to because this will make a lot more sense. But with that said, let's just pick it up and go back to the recording. I'm good. I'm calm. I'm back. A little beverage. It helps cool things down. Mike, you are the best. Thank you so much for letting me get this off my chest. I think it's so important to process these things emotionally in the moment while they're fresh. I'm not going to lie, Mike, this next part of the story is going to sound like it crosses some lines. But this is what happened. Jesus knew exactly what he was doing when he had his disciples eat food out of fields on the Sabbath when we were watching. He knows we're not going to like it. Of course, we didn't like it. I'm calm. I'm good. I'm good. And then, yeah, we set it up this way because we wanted to know what he would do. We put a guy in front of him with a busted up hand and then he'll get with a busted up hand on the Sabbath. He couldn't have done it the next day. Would have killed him the way today. That guy's hand has been wrecked for years and years and years. I think he can live with one more day of having his hand messed up. No, we have to do it right now. Why to make a point to stick it to us to drive that wedge even further. I'm not going to lie. I was not one of them, but there may or may not have been some talk after that in particular incident about maybe he's just gone too far. And maybe it would be better if something were to happen to him and he were no longer with us. Oh, man, it's just gross. He's just totally obsessed with us, always thinking about how to stick it to us and how to make a point. He needs to get on with his life and think about something else. So anyways, after that, he went out into the wilderness and we followed him out there to see what he was going to do next. And sure enough, he starts doing the same stuff he was doing before, casting out demons. Well, how can someone who we can obviously tell is bad cast out demons, which are bad? The answer is because he's in league with the demons and he's uneducated. Bumpkins can't see that. So he gives another speech and everybody thinks it's really good. And I admit he made some good points in this speech and we're like, okay, read the room, read the room, Pharisee Jeff. It's not going to work. Keep firing off bullets like this. Everybody's crazy about the guy. Let's just ask him a nice question and show that we're civilized here and that he's the one who's the problem. So I just went up to him and was like, I just, could you just, can we just have another sign? Like just do another one of the things that you do. Everybody loves miracles, do another miracle. And then he goes off on this whole thing about, oh, it's a wicked and adulterous generation. And I'm just trying to play along with what you're into and try to give you a chance to prove yourself and show that you are who you say you are and then you're mad about everything again. And I'm like, I just cannot win with you. There's nothing I can do with you and I have to have a break. And so we wake up one morning, dudes going out of town. Fine. We took the opportunity to go get some downtime for ourselves and I'm like, good. Finally, because this isn't my job. It's not my responsibility to chase around some Galilean out in the wilderness watching every stupid thing he does so I can call it out and keep it in check so it doesn't spread like some kind of cancer and ruin everything. It's my job to go to work at the temple, to think about the law, to think about things that bring order and rightness to society. It is my job to serve people by giving them guidance and wisdom. So yeah, sue me if I'm a little bit grouchy about what this guy did to my schedule. I'm going to find out during this downtime that apparently Carl, back at the home office, isn't satisfied with my progress on the Jesus situation. So he and a couple other heavy hitters come all the way from Jerusalem and they're like, oh, we'll show you how to do this thing right. This is totally off the record, Mike, and I know that I can trust you, but Carl is like 600% incompetent. Everybody at the office knows it. Say what you want about Jesus of Nazareth, but dude is good. He knows what he's doing. We all who've been up there are like, you know, I'm just going to stroll in here and fix this thing, Carl, but good luck, homie. And his big plan to sort the whole thing out is you're going to get kicked out of this. It's too complainative him because his disciples don't wash their hands well enough. Like we didn't try that already, man. He rolls it out there and Jesus is in a particular feisty mood that day. He starts quoting Isaiah and calling people hypocrites and Carl's standing there looking like an idiot deer in the headlights. What I do to telling you that is what happens. And after that day, it just seemed like we never had a chance up there again. It was super uncomfortable anywhere we went. And speaking looking at us differently is right after that Jesus and his crew went off on another one of their kumbaya spirit hikes up in the mountains or whatnot. But when they came back down from that, it's like they all looked at us differently. It's like after that they just knew what we were planning to do. I think that's on Carl. I'm telling you, he is the worst. I mean, we tried a couple things when we did see him. We sent the guy that collects the temple tax to ask him if he was going to pay it and then he just paid it. And we asked him some questions about worse and remarriage and he just came out looking stupid in front of everybody. I'm telling you, man, the tide had just turned. There was no winning up there falling back. It was the smartest thing to do. But what we didn't expect is that he was going to follow us to Jerusalem, which he did. And so in that respect, I kind of think what happened to him is sort of his own fault because that's kind of jabbing the bear. You're going to where we all work. I mean, up north you got a bunch of, well, like leather farmers and people who I don't know, smash rocks together all day. You can dupe these people into falling. You dumb parlor tricks, but Jerusalem is sophisticated. You're not just going to walk in there and have everybody fall all over you like they did up north. I don't know what outcome he was expecting when he came south, but I will not be made to feel guilty about it. He gets into Jerusalem and pass over a week. I don't remember what day is early in the week and the place is packed. And to his credit, he had more of a following there than I would have guessed. People were excited. They cheered and celebrated as he came into town. Rather than just riding the wave of goodwill, leaving things well enough alone, he goes to the temple and he wrecks everything we heard about it, Mike. Why would you do that? Do you want people to like you? It's a stupid move, stupid move. But I don't know. All of us kind of got to laugh out of it because the money changing crowd is a little bit uppity. You know, they're for a minute. The enemy of my enemy thing kicks in, but what I thought was going to happen didn't happen. People were fine with it and they started coming to him and he started doing the same kind of stuff that he was doing was a little traveling road show up north. And now this is happening in Jerusalem and everybody's getting pretty excited about it and people are starting to throw around the son of David thing again. And I'm telling you, dude, if you were there, you could just see it in his eyes. He knows exactly what that means. He knows that is Messiah talk and he knows he should shut it down and he won't. He just lets them say it. So we give him a chance to walk it back to make a public statement and get the thing under control. We go in front of everybody, no secrecy. And we're like, hey, the children are saying this about you. Could you please clarify those remarks and tell them to stop? And does he listen? No. Instead, he just quotes some Bible verse from Psalms at us. And Mike, this right here is the point where I am no longer apologizing for my part in this whole thing. If he wants to have this clown show way out in the sticks where it affects some farmers or something, you know what? Fine. You can be the king of the farmers. But if you come to Jerusalem to Jerusalem and pull those kind of stunts here, we're not going to tolerate that. Look man, everybody who's everybody agrees that we got to do something about that. We have a meeting that night and I mean everybody's there. The Sadducees are there. The chief priests, the elders. Heck, we even had Herodians there. Now we agree. If he shows up in the temple tomorrow, we're going to hit him with everything we've got and we're going to humiliate this joker in front of everyone. Next day dude, just like Lockworth, he shows up, we send out Team One. And we're like, hey, where do you get the authority to do this stuff? Perfectly reasonable question, right? And he responds with, well, I'll only answer your question if you answer my question. What about John's baptism? Does that come from heaven or from men? We're like, that's what aboutism? What the heck are you even talking about right now? But even if it's a dumb argument, everybody's right there looking. So we kind of go off to the side for a minute like, I will say that John's baptism is from heaven. He's going to be like, why didn't you believe him? And if we say it's from men, he's going to melt down and freak out right here because he's got him totally hoodwinked. So we just told him we didn't know. We totally did know those dirty tricks. I mean, what the heck are you even supposed to do with that? And so he tells a couple of stories and of course we come out looking like complete idiots in these stories. In front of everyone, mind you, I'm standing there and acting like we're respectfully listening, but the truth is, the ship is sailed. Like at this point, we just have to admit, these ideas are dangerous. These ideas are a threat to everything about our system of government and our way of life. And some ideas are simply too dangerous to let go unchecked. We need to get the guy arrested, which means we have to work with the local authorities, which none of us find to be a great option. But you got to do what you got to do at some point. And I say again, I'm not going to be made to feel guilty by critics for doing what has to be done for their own good. Do I sound unhinged to you? The way you're looking at me seems like you think that I'm unhinged. No, no, you don't have to say sorry. I'm sorry. I was probably reading your face wrong. Just the way you were looking at me, but I'm not the crazy one here. He is. Whatever. We followed through on all the things that we said we were going to do at our meeting. Some of my guys came up and asked a question about Pantax's disease and he totally ducked that, but everybody cheered and was thrilled with his answer. And Darryl and Marv, the Sadducees, you met them at the Christmas party last year. Yeah, he's the tall one. Yeah, and Marv is the one who always brags about the crossfiting. Yes, those guys. They came up and they asked him this labyrinthine question about marriage and dying and who's going to be married to who in the end. I don't know. They were trying to bang there. We don't like the idea of resurrection drum. It didn't play well with anyone. And then God bless him. Glenn, you remember Glenn, the guy with the incredibly soft heart who always gives everybody the benefit of the doubt who's been on the board since forever's. Well, he walks up and is like, you know what, maybe I'll just ask a nice question for a change. He's like, oh, which one's the greatest commandment? And Jesus is like, I love your neighbor as yourself and love God with everything you got. And Glenn was like, oh, that's actually a pretty good answer. And we're like, thanks a lot, Glenn. That's super helpful. Okay, you can go now. That didn't work. But still think it was a good plan is just flawed execution. But you think Jesus then would be like, okay, I'm probably done talking with these people and he said, he comes over where we're all huddled up. He's like, I got a question for you. And we're like, OK. And he's like, oh, what do you think about the Christ? Two sun is the and we're like, well, he's the son of David. Everybody knows his son of David. And then he goes on to quote Psalm 110 at us like the Psalm that we always talk about. It's like our theme verse and he tries to flip it around on us to be like, oh, David calls the Christ Lord. How can it be his son? And we're like, well, I mean, it's that. OK, it's a good point. It gets that's a reasonable way. Look, it doesn't matter if it's a good point or not. The point is he's a threat and we've established that and we've seen that from the beginning. And at some point, it's just not a conversation anymore. We're not having fun. These words have consequences and implications and somebody has to have the courage to do something to make it stop. People are going to start getting hurt because of these words. And that's where the boundaries of his freedom to go around and spout all this stuff is. And that's where it's happened. Like, I didn't want it to come to this. I did not want to get to a place where the only solution is to put a guy to death for word crimes. But some word crimes rise to that level. And this is it. I see that. Look on your face, man. I'm not happy about it either. But if you had been there for the whole thing, you would be saying exactly the stuff that I'm saying right now. Oh, sorry, bro. That was too much. I just, my nerves are shot. Things are a little bit raw and like straight up between you and me, this thing is going to come to a head in the next couple of days and you might not want to be in town when it does. But seriously, you are a great listener. I'd like to make a blanket catch all statement regarding pretty much all of the material from the last two episodes. And that is this paraphrase is mine.
