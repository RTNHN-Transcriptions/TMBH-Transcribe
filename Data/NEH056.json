It's fast, fun, free, daily, deep-dye Bible, and right now we're working on the book of Me Amaya. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here, or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy to use format at thetmbh.com. The first series we did on this podcast was on Matthew. A bunch of you were there for it. Thank you. It's awesome to have you around still. It was a blast because Jesus is in it, and it took forever to get through his 800 episodes long. I loved doing that, and we'll do another gospel someday. That'll be fun. But one of the things I love about it is you get to hang around with Jesus, not just because he's held out as being God in the flesh and the Son of God. I mean, all of this stuff's pretty great. But also, he's just so dang witty. He's smart. He always knows what to say. I don't think Jesus ever walked away from my conversation. And then half an hour later, he was like, oh, I should have said this because I do that all the time. But Jesus seemed like he always got his money's worth and did so very efficiently, saying a lot with very little. And a key example of this is a turn of a phrase he uses a couple of times in Matthew 26, where with just a few little words, you have said it is so or you have said so. He tells an antagonistic person two things once. One, the thing you are saying that you don't fully understand that is profound and important is indeed true. Two, I see that you're being duplicitous is just absolutely brilliant. And yes, I'm going to give you those two examples. And it's going to make sense. We're going to talk about Nehemiah here in just a minute. So one is at the last supper, you got Judas skulking about. And Jesus said, I'm going to be betrayed by one of you guys and Judas who would betray him. This is verse 26 of Matthew 26 said, well, is it I rabbi? And Jesus said, you have said it is so or you have said so. And in doing so, he brilliantly bounces it back at Judas is like, come on, we both know what's going on here. And yeah, you know, dang, well, it is you. And then Judas does betray him and Jesus gets arrested and the religious leaders are getting after him and they're like, well, aren't you going to answer? What about these testimonies that these men are given against you? But Jesus remained silent. And then the high priest said to him, I adore you by the living God. Tell us if you are the Christ, the son of God. And then Jesus said to him, you have said it is so. And he goes on to say, but I tell you from now on, you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of the power and coming on the clouds of heaven. I just wanted to read the rest of that because it's pretty awesome. The twice Jesus uses that little turn of a phrase to say, yeah, you don't get it. You don't totally understand what you're asking. But even as my enemy, you have accidentally spoken truth, a profound truth, a big truth that goes much further than what you understand. And I feel like we get one of those moments in Nehemiah chapter four. The last few days, we've been talking about sandblots, insults to Nehemiah and the Jews who are rebuilding the walls. And I keep saying that there's one of these phrases we're going to come back to. The final insult of sandblot is, can they, the Jews and Nehemiah, bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble burned as they are? And I would submit to you, my friend, so that this is a, you have said it is so moment on the part of sandblot. He has no idea what kind of language he is tapping into here. He has no idea the thread, the through line that goes through all of the redemptive plan, all of the Bible that he is inadvertently referencing. But he is pointing to something where the answer is, I mean, in a sense, yes, stones will be brought back to life. Now, I mean, the first reference to this is early on in the Bible and the idea that the animals and that life is something that God brought up out of the dust. He made it out of the dirt, pulled it out of the dirt. So clearly the Bible holds out the God of the Bible as having the ability to bring life out of something as lifeless as dirt or stone or dust. But then you skip ahead a little bit to a book that is later in the Bible as you just turn pages and work your way through it left to right. But earlier chronologically than what we're reading here in Nehemiah, and that is the very curious book of Ezekiel. Well, this guy was one of the initial exiles, one of the first people to get taken away into captivity, 160 years before the events we're reading about in Nehemiah. He was probably in that first wave of exiles who were deported along with Daniel, Chadrak, Meshach and Abednego. And Ezekiel wanted to be a priest. He figured out pretty quick. He was never going to be one because he wasn't going to live in Jerusalem. He was going to live in exile in Babylon. And he has this vision and he records it and the vision kind of takes you all over the place into unseen and different spiritual realms. But also the whole story is about God's dealing with Israel, God's seeing through his redemptive plan and using Israel for those purposes. There's some language in here about bringing life back out of something that is stone cold dusty dead in Ezekiel 37. It's a pretty famous passage. Let me read some of this to you starting in verse 1. The hand of the Lord is upon me and he brought me out by the spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a valley. And that was full of bones. He led me back and forth among them. I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley. Bones that were very dry. He asked me, this is God asking Ezekiel, son of man, can these bones live? Now that son of man phrase right there, that's ringing a bell. We went and looked at this passage when Jesus started using that title son of man in the book of Matthew as well. So if it's familiar from our conversations, that's probably where we talked about it. I said, Oh, sovereign Lord, you alone know that he said to me, prophesied to these bones and say to them, dry bones, pure the word of the Lord. This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones, I will make breath enter you and you will come to life. I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin. I will put breath in you and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I was commanded and as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound and the bones came together, bone to bone. I looked in tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them. I said to me, prophesied to the breath, prophesied son of man and say to it, this is what the sovereign Lord says, come from the four winds, oh breath and breathe into these slain that they may live. So I prophesied as he commanded me and breath entered them. They came to life and stood up on their feet of vast army. Then he said to me, son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say our bones are dried up and our hope is gone. We're cut off. We're prophesied and say to them, this is what the sovereign Lord says. Oh my people, I'm going to open your graves and bring you up from them. I will bring you back to the land of Israel. Then you, my people will know that I am the Lord when I open your graves and bring you up from them. I will put my spirit in you and you will live and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken and I have done it, declares the Lord and Nehemiah would have been totally aware of this passage. He would have been aware of the prophet Jeremiah, the weeping prophet. Both Jeremiah and Ezekiel were fully aware that God's chosen people were going to be punished by foreign nations, that they were going to lose custody of their land. But also both of them were made aware by God that there would be a restoration that would occur that this dead land would be brought back to life. Obviously the imagery here in Ezekiel illustrates that in a way that's very, very memorable and vivid for the imagination. Nehemiah would have had that in his head. Ezra would have had that in his head. I think part of the reason Ezra acted so confidently the way he did with how he went back in the book we looked at before this is because of these promises, these visuals. But this through line in the Bible of God taking stone cold, dead, dusty, dry things and bringing them back to life doesn't just deal with Israel and their political coming and going and their exile and unexiling. It carries on into the New Testament and it goes to the heart of man. It goes to the soul. It goes to the whole grand redemptive plan that extends beyond the political history of Israel and beyond what God is demonstrating, as he says explicitly here in Ezekiel 37, about himself and his redemptive plan through his workings with Israel. It goes to a much bigger place and this theme of life coming out of absolute deadness is illustrated most profoundly in the resurrection of Jesus himself. But then that is treated in the New Testament as the first fruits, the first example of how God's going to do that in the lives of people. The Bible describes us, people as dead in our sins, dead in our transgressions, absolutely hopeless but God by his grace through the work of Christ, through the power of his ability to give life and to give forgiveness, breeds life into these dead beings like the dead bones, the corpses in the valley that we're talking about here in Ezekiel. That happens for anybody who is in Christ according to what is taught in the New Testament. And even then that is not the end of the theme of this dead stuff being brought back to life or life coming out of things that are seemingly dead and inanimate. The further step is that these people who are in Christ and brought from death to life, people like you and me, is that those who have this new life out of death then have responsibility and a role in the whole kingdom, the whole redemptive plan of God as well. And that is spelled out. I'm scrambling for it. It's in first Peter, could have written it down. Thought I knew where it was. Don't have it. It's not on the page where it is. Yes, I am stalling. Thought it was first Peter one. It isn't. It's first Peter too. Found it right here. As you come to him, the living stone, talking about Jesus now, rejected by men, but chosen by God and precious to him, you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For in scripture, it says, see, I lay a stone in Zion in Jerusalem, a chosen and precious cornerstone and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame. Now to you who believe this stone is precious, but to those who do not believe the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone or the capstone and a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And you could probably tell that some of that in there was prose and those were quotes from Psalms in Isaiah. So the point is that in Nehemiah chapter four, Sanbalat is raging, grouchy and angry about things, just firing off insults in all directions. But in the middle of all of that, he has a, you have said it is so style insult. It happens to nail a motif that runs through all of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament, a motif that is introduced at the very beginning of the Bible with creation, a motif that is accentuated when Israel goes through its darkest days, losing custody of its land with the destruction of the temple being taken into exile. But God still promising that he will demonstrate his glory by breathing life into this seemingly dead thing to make these grander points. And then that motif and that through line that Nehemiah plays a part in by rebuilding these walls, a visible, tangible illustration of what God is doing redemptively in the bigger picture. All of that through line then carries through into Jesus his work on the cross, how salvation and hope for human kind works and the role that those who are in Christ play in becoming living stones being built into the spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to God through Jesus Christ. The temple and the city that Nehemiah is rebuilding here, that's for a moment, that's for a time. But as we follow this through line that Sanbalat stumbles upon in his sloppy insults through into the New Testament, what we find is that there's more than just a physical temple that's going to happen, that Nehemiah is custodian of a moment in this story, but that the fulfillment and the completion of this story about the temple and everything that surrounds it and the security of that is culminated in Jesus and what he does in the lives of people and how he raises up dead stones. People who are dead in their transgressions as dead as a rock, he raises them up into something that is not only alive but alive and thriving and glorifying to God and components that build up this collective whole that is this holy priesthood, that is this new family of faith all bringing glory to God in the end. Sanbalat thought he was just yelling about stuff, turns out that it was a, you have said it is so moment and I thought it was really cool and I wanted to pull on that thread a little bit. All right, that's plenty for today. I'm Matt, this is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
