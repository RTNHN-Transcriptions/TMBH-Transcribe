This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Pop quiz. What is the biggest city in Nebraska? 54321. It was Omaha. You got that one. Come on. Alright, pop quiz number two. What's the second biggest city in Nebraska? 54321. It was Lincoln. Very good job. That's capital. Very, very good job. Pop quiz number three. What's the third biggest city in Nebraska? 54321. If you said Grand Island, because it is known as the third city, you are wrong because Grand Island hasn't been growing for a while. I don't know what the deal is there. It's a nice town, but Bellevue has surpassed it. Bellevue, Nebraska. This is going somewhere. Stay with me, but you're still kind of wrong because really the biggest city in Nebraska is a seasonal city that happens seven times a year during Nebraska home games. Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska holds like 90,000 people and is therefore by my rendering because I declared it and I bought a microphone and put things on the internet. Therefore, I'm the authority figure. That is the third biggest city in Nebraska. Some of the time, which is incredible to think about, but you got something like this where you live, right? Like a thing that makes the area swell beyond capacity and everything feels different and looks different and the businesses are different and the lodging and accommodations are different. For us, it's the sturges motorcycle rally just up the road from where I live in the black Hills and that's not exactly my family's speed or style, but I know a lot of people like it and wow, can you tell when that's going on? Everything changes around here for a week plus. Well, if you can understand what that scenario is like in Lincoln, Nebraska, the black is a South Dakota, wherever you live, then you can understand what was going on in Matthew chapter 21 when things are ramping up for the Passover. The Passover is a gigantic, important Jewish festival. It had been for a long, long time before this moment in history. It has been for a long, long time after it is obviously connected to the story of the Exodus and the book of Exodus and the Old Testament where God told everybody to slap some blood on the door posts of their houses and then they would be passed over by this angel of judgment and doom that came as part of the series of judgments of plagues that came upon the people of Egypt to make it really clear that the one true God was behind these people and that the Pharaoh was supposed to let them go. Again, more on all of that later on. Passover is a gigantic deal though and Jerusalem is where you go to celebrate the Passover. And so everything is swollen to capacity. It's beyond Memorial Stadium and Lincoln, Nebraska on game day. It's going to be nuts. And we have to remember that that's what's going on behind the text of this event and that everybody in Matthew's Jewish audience would have been like, Oh, no, we're doing this right now. Like, really, this is when all of this has to go down. Like that's that's bike rally season. Well, you can't do that on a Saturday in October. That's the Oklahoma game or whatever your thing is where you live. You would have known like, Oh, whoa. Okay. That's not normal Jerusalem. That's Passover Jerusalem. And it is going to be absolutely bonkers there. And I think that reality comes into play in a couple of things that we've already looked at in Matthew chapter 21. First of all, you got a little bit of that festival atmosphere. You ever been to a music festival? We used to go to cornerstone rock festival in Illinois. And it was nuts. Everybody dressed different. You live different. You functioned different. Your schedule was different. Everything was different for a week. And when you're in that festival mindset, you just jump in with anything spontaneous. I mean, what else do you have to do? You're there for the experience. And so all the people jumping in spontaneously and being like, Whoa, Louisiana, the son of David, blessed is you comes in the name of the Lord. That energy would make perfect sense given the week. And again, the original audience would have been able to envision that like, Oh, well, yeah, of course, people were going to get excited that week. People are excited about anything or pretty fickle. I mean, it's festival time. And then after that, when Jesus goes to the temple, this isn't normal business hours. This is Black Friday. I mean, everybody's there to make their sacrifices, big ones for the year. The lines would have been long. Things would have been crazy. And people in the original audience would have been like, Are you kidding me? He flipped over tables that week. Wow, I wait a time it to really emphasize your point in front of everyone. And then you got to figure as we move on in Matthew chapter 21 to the fallout from the flipping over of tables, it included lots of people being really excited, but the religious leadership being really mad. You got to remember like this is the, this is prom. This is the most magical time of the year for them. They put all this time into it. It's also where they probably do like half of their business and somebody's coming along and somebody they didn't already like very much anyway. And he's wrecking everything and messing with it. Like we have to address this thing right now. These are children who are out there yelling this stuff. Jesus, like surely you're going to denounce this is nonsensical festival chatter from the unwashed masses. I mean, it doesn't count. And then we run into yet another detail that I think makes more sense when we consider the atmosphere at this moment in the year that's going on here. And that is the fact that Jesus is not staying in Jerusalem at all. Verse 16, here we go. This is the religious leaders yelling at Jesus. Do you hear what these children are saying? They asked him, yeah, Jesus replied, if you never read from the lips of children and infants, you have ordained praise. And then verse 17, and he left them and went out of the city to Bethany where he spent the night. Bethany would be back. I think it would just be the way he came in. I don't know. Maybe there's another route into Jerusalem from the northern end of the Dead Sea that you could take where you'd avoid Bethany night. He went through Bethany, didn't he? I think he went through Bethany or he went right by it at any rate and it would make sense that he would go through Bethany, both because it's the natural route up from Jericho. And because he knows people there. Bethany is not just some town to him. This is a town where he's got meaningful connections and some pretty legitimate messiah support because of things that people there have seen him do. Now you and I have gone through one of the four gospel accounts, one of the four accounts of the life of Jesus and that is Matthew. And Matthew, like all of the gospel authors, has made editorial decisions about the three years that are largely in focus in Jesus' life because you just can't cover all the stuff. So Matthew lumps a bunch of things together. Like he healed their sick and he said some stuff and is great and people believed and is great and then he went on to the next thing. He's always summarizing to move us along. Whatever he includes moves forward the theological thesis that is introduced in Matthew chapter one, which is that Jesus is the son of Abraham and the son of David and that he's the Christ. He's the Messiah. He's the fulfillment of all the stuff that happened before. This is the one you're looking for and everything we're going to do from here on out is going to be in narrative service of that thesis. Well the other gospel accounts also have a thesis. They're also trying to do stuff. They're also making editorial decisions. John comes right out and acknowledges those editorial decisions that he made saying like there's a ton of other stuff that he did. I suppose like if you want to write it down, it would take up a ton of space. I think John even acknowledges that twice. Luke acknowledges that he's going through a research and editorial process at the beginning of not just Luke, but also act. He's like, yeah, that was a good idea to put together all of this stuff. My dear buddy Theophilus. And so here it all is. I did a bunch of research. I got witness reports and I did my homework and here you are. And implicit in that is the notion of editing. Well, John edits a little bit different than the rest of the gospels. Stuff lines up pretty neatly with, I think, one grand exception. And that is that John orders his account in such a way that we're back and forth to Jerusalem or back and forth from up north to near Jerusalem down south. It looks like maybe more than once. Now I acknowledged the other day that there's some debate about how to read this in terms of whether there's one clearing of the temple or two clearing of the temples because John places it really early in Jesus' public life and the synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke that all see it from the same chronological perspective. They place it obviously right here during passion week, Passover week toward the end of Jesus life. But no matter how you slice it, all of the gospel accounts in one way or another agree that Jesus was connected with Bethany. And in particular that he had friends and sort of like almost such friends that they're almost like family, Mary and Martha are from this neck of the woods. Luke has Jesus there in Luke chapter 10. It doesn't explicitly say he was in Bethany, but it looks like that's where we're talking about. And then most famously in John 11, John has Jesus going to Bethany. I mean, that's where Lazarus lives and raising Lazarus from the dead. So in line of that, what I want to do in this next conversation is look a little more closely at Jesus connections with the town of Bethany and what the stuff that happened there would mean to the original audience. What is it supposed to mean for us that he's staying there and not in Jerusalem? What would the base of support look like there? And I want to frame all of that from today's conversation tomorrow's conversation in light of the reality that we're talking about, not normal Jerusalem, but Memorial Stadium and Lincoln, Nebraska on a game day in the fall, swollen Jerusalem and that swelling with religious pilgrims coming from all over the place, flocking toward the temple and toward having a special meal that would occur during that given week. All of that stuff is going to bleed out into the surrounding countryside and the surrounding villages so that this is even more than just a Jerusalem event, a Jerusalem buzz that Jesus is creating here. There's a whole regional effect occurring and that is a pretty fascinating thing in terms of this biblical notion of the fullness of time and how all of these rhythms play out for maximum effect in terms of the redemptive project that the Bible is describing Jesus as being the culminating character in more on festival Jerusalem and the significance in the gospels of the town of Bethany, manana.
