And yesterday we got into the sort of interpersonal deep water stuff talking about two talent guy and how underrated two talent guy or two talent lady is. And the advantages of conceiving of ourselves as somewhere in the middle as opposed to the very, very least vested or the very, very most talented. And today I want to pivot on to another observation or another thing I've been thinking about the whole parable of the talent steel and actually over in the subreddit where we discuss these things together. I noticed a couple of you raised to the question as well. But this is one I've thought about a ton as I've reflected on this passage over the years. And that's this one of two talent guy or five talent guy busted their butt and they were like, I understand the character of the master. I know who you are. I know what you want me to do. I think I understand your values. I understand what you vested me with. I want your kingdom to win. I am all in. So I am going to take a big chance and do this thing that I think is right. And I'm not doing it out of pride. I'm doing it out of humility and submission. Let's give this thing a go and they take a big giant swing and they throw their whole life and all their potential and their reputation and everything out of it and it just that I know it's just that it's nothing really happens. It just kind of didn't work. And that was it. And then the master talks to that person. He's like, all right. So I gave you five talents. That is a ton. What do you got for me? And then maybe in hypothetical number one, five talent guys like, uh, okay. I know who you are. I know what you want me to do. I think I understand your character. I think I understand your values. I really thought I was being shrewd. And this was a good idea and I went and I did this stuff and it didn't work. I got a zero percent return. I didn't burn through your money. I also didn't make you any money. I mean, actually I lost like 75 cents. So I came real close. I wanted it to work. I wish it had. Here's everything back. What do you think the master does in that situation based on what you've read in this parable and what you've seen throughout the whole book of Matthew? And on that, let me run a hypothetical number two. Let's say five talent lady does all the same stuff, all the same motivation, everything. And then the master comes back and the master's like, all right, I'm back to five talent lady. What'd you do for me, Brenda? And Brenda's like, okay, about that. So I had a really good idea and I feel like I understood exactly what you wanted me to do and who you are. And I care deeply, like entirely like I'm fully committed to your household and your success and the growth of your holdings and I'm in, I'm completely in. I saw a thing. I thought I was being shrewd about it. I took a gigantic swing and it went super, super, super badly. Well, like what kind of badly are we talking about, Brenda? Like the kind of badly where I don't actually have any of it anymore. Like there's zero. I have zero. It's just shot. I'm super sorry. What do you think the master does in that situation? Now, at this point, it's really easy to be like, oh, well, there's a Bible verse for that. Word of the Lord, it won't return void. Or we could go to Matthew 10 and be like, I'll tell you what to say. I'll tell you what to do to navigate these things. So that's impossible. It's impossible that Brenda could truly be all in and fully committed to the kingdom, all in on the values, everything and invest the riches of the master and then have it come back just straight up empty. It couldn't possibly happen. But I don't know. You hear stories. You even see things unfold with people where, man, you watch the way their life goes. It seems like they're super in and they're smart and they're capable and gifted and it seems like they get it and that I see what they're doing. That seems like a really good idea. That's great. And then just something breaks the wrong way and it doesn't work and there's kind of nothing to show for it. I think I like some missionaries I know who saved up a bunch of money and put all of their energy into positioning themselves to pay off their student debt and everything else so they could go into the mission field in a certain place and then they get there and then like four days later, there's like a civil war and they have to go home. And that's kind of it. And that was it. That was my 20s. That's what I had. Sorry, I got nothing to show for it. Maybe you could say nothing to show for it is just impossible with this master that that could be that always there's there's something to show for it and the master might see value in places we don't. Maybe the master metaphorically goes back through the tailings at the bottom of the gold sluice and is like, well, if you just look right here underneath these riffles, you'll see that actually you did capture that gold all along. Well done. Good and faithful Brenda. Come on in and enjoy your master's sharing his happiness is great, but also maybe not. Maybe sometimes people come out of the right way and they try to be shrewd and because they're not got to just it doesn't work out and then there's no return whatsoever or worse yet. It looks like everything was just lost completely with not only no return, but like not even able to give back the initial investment. Maybe the metaphor stretches thin and kind of breaks down at that point. Well, again, I asked, what do you think? What does the master do in that situation? And I keep coming back to this. If we just look at this parable in its immediate context chapter 24 and 25, first and foremost, it isn't necessarily about the individual behavior as much as it is more about an orientation. It's having your head screwed on straight in terms of the kingdom values of history, how time is going to unfold and what it looks like to get it right and why some of the people in Jesus time who had gotten it wrong, those being the religious leaders, why they just got called out the way they got called out a couple chapters earlier. So acknowledging that there is definitely an immediate context here. I still think we can get an approximation of how the master would have responded based on all of the other things that we learned about the master from all around the rest of the Bible and the New Testament. So what I see, for example, in another parable over in Luke and one of you in the subreddit various tootly anticipated where I was going with this and pointed it out and that is awesome, but there's a super famous parable of the lost son. This is the one where the kid goes to the dad and he's like, I want all your riches. I want all your vestedness right now. I just, I got some partying. I have a bunch of different types of booze that I want to try. It's like the old Chicago, they do this thing now where you can tour the whole world and beer and I want to do it like a thousand times and I'm going to need all your money. Then he goes off and he just gets hammered at old Chicago all the time and then he ends up like eating pig slop and he's miserable all his party buddies. I don't love him anymore. The sex thing didn't make him happy and booze and the drugs like it all didn't work out. It just burned down and went to garbage and he's like, you know what? I could eat this pig slot forever. I could just go back and be a slave in my father's household. Maybe take me back. And so the kid prepares his whole speech and he's going back to his father. And while he's still a long ways off, the father's like, what? I've been looking for this for a long time and he sees the kid and the father. He doesn't even care about his dignity. He's another master of the household. The servants are watching. Everybody's there. He's like, forget it. And he goes running off the porch, clear down the dirty, disgusting road. He doesn't make the sun come crawling to him. And then the runaway son is like, I'm an idiot. I did a bunch. I'm not even worthy to be back here. And the dad's like, forget it. Like my son was dead. Now he's alive again. You're back. Put the ring on him. He's my son, my heir. He burned through everything I've invested in with like an idiot. But here he is. And he's forgiven and he's restored and there's celebration for all of that. You kind of got a square Matthew 25 with Luke 15, right? The context of Luke 15 is a bunch of fancy religious leaders and the people who are being condemned and like the context of Matthew over in Luke, the fancy religious leaders. They're like, ah, sinners are awful. Jesus hangs out with them. And that's what makes Jesus bad. All these sinners were like, they were figuring it out and they were repentant. And then Jesus tells these stories of the lost coin and the lost sheep and then the culminating story, the lost son that we just reviewed. And so the point is like, I don't know, the provision of the grace of the master in this household is enormous. The master is so benevolent and so patient and so loves the kid and yearns for the kids return that he responds to the way he responds over in Matthew chapter 25. What we're getting is a parable that comes right on the heels of the failure of the religious leadership being highlighted by Jesus and the disciples being like, okay, the whole system's getting taken apart. Everything's getting busted up. There's judgment coming because I guess we all missed the point, but now we'd like to get the point. What does it look like for us to be oriented to you and to the point moving forward? And Jesus lays out the parables we've been looking at in light of that. So then the question is, what about the forgiveness of Luke 15? Could that apply to the situation of the person who got it wrong as we read the parable in Matthew 25? And I think the resounding answer has to be yes. I had suggested earlier that we were going to have a short conversation landing the plane on Matthew 25. But what I am discovering as I sit here and game it out with you is that in my heart, I really wanted to talk a lot more about it because I am thinking about this too. And I don't want to rush it. We're going to hit pause there, we're going to pick up right where we left off tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
