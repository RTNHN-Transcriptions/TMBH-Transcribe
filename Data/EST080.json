Now it's time to just put the ball in play and see what happens famously, of course, Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon after the politics turned ugly and Rome and they turned against him because of all of his massive amounts of success and because of just the quirkiness of Rome in general at that time. Famously, Caesar is said to have come upon the Rubicon River, the place where you have to leave your legions behind if you're a general, you can't bring them with you into Rome and Caesar gets there and he crosses it with his legion and he says the die is cast. That wasn't a phrase that he made up or introduced into the vernacular right there and the image of a die being cast is something that had thousands of years worth of legs behind it before that point and it's got a couple thousand years worth of use since then as well. It's just a beautiful little metaphor, that little simple, sick-sided in most cases, cube tells the story of randomness. It is randomness incarnate. So when I say it that way, you would think that we're talking about a rival deity to God, who Jesus is God incarnate at dice or a die is randomness incarnate, but if God is really the sovereign over all things and he really is providential over all of history and surprised by nothing and knows everything that might be or could have been, then that would mean that such a deity has known literally what every single die that has ever been cast was going to come up, including the fateful die that are cast in the Bible. We're looking at one of those that gets cast right here in Esther chapter three as Haman has his associates, his royal officials, his attendants, his diviners, his clarimancers, whoever throw the die for him says in Esther three verse seven in the 12th year of King Xerxes in the first month, the month of Nissan, they cast the poor. That is the lot in the presence of Haman to select a day and month and the lot fell on the 12th month, the month of Adar. Well, as we talked about yesterday, there are a lot of indications from other parts of the Bible that again, how that die comes up isn't really random or at the very least isn't really a surprise to God. Perhaps the philosophers and theologians might argue that there are some castes of the die that determine nothing about the unfolding of the redemptive plan and really are totally inconsequential. Perhaps God does not move his hand over the top of that die to create the outcome that he's ordained or that he wants. Perhaps their other die, where the casting of them gets you closer to the central thread of God's redemptive plan, and they're much like Qui-Gon Jinn might wave his hand over the dice, metaphorically speaking, to get the outcome that he wants. And a close reading of the text in Esther chapter three indicates that that might be the case here. As we've discussed, we don't know for sure why Haman let the lot, let the die, let the poor make the decision as to how this would all time out, but he did. And in doing so, he gets the worst possible outcome if indeed he's looking for a hasty resolution to his genocidal ambitions. Look closely in the 12th year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nissan, they cast the poor. What does it fall on? Well, it falls on the 12th month, the month of Adar. So it's the longest possible lead time that could have resulted from this clairomancy process that Haman engaged in. Bad luck, maybe. But there's another interesting hint in the middle of this casting of the die passage that maybe further points us toward our, we are expected to read this as God having waved his hand over the dice, Qui-Gon Jinn style. Look right here, it says again, they cast the poor and then in parentheses, that is the lot. Now, the word poor is not a native Hebrew word. It's a loner word that Hebrews would have been familiar with, but it was drawn from the Akkadian language. I don't know all of this, obviously. By the way, this is kind of stuff that I have to look up. I'm not some kind of expert in ancient Akkadian, but you're smart. If you know your way around the internet, you can Google these things and research the veracity of them for yourselves as well. But the Akkadians were a very ancient people group who had risen and fallen prominence a few times in the Mesopotamian world, the Assyrians, and then especially the Babylonians, and now the Persians, sort of been heirs to the Akkadian legacy. The Akkadians had cultural overlap with the Hebrews, some linguistic overlap. So the poor is a term that was drawn from them that was popular in the Persian courts for this, but the word Purim is a Hebrew pluralization of that Akkadian loner word. But the Hebrews apparently also had their own word for this. Again, no way I would know this at the top of my head. I Googled stuff. This is work we can all do. And the Hebrew term, which I understand to be Goral or Goral, I don't know exactly how you pronounce it, is exactly the word that is used to describe those big decisions made in other parts of the Old Testament where a casting of lots or a casting of the die was used. So here's the interesting thing. It looks like Haman is imagining that he is using a tool of the trade, a weapon of spiritual war that is from his people or from the Persian side of things. But he's not an object, a relic used for determining fate like this is something that is putty in the hands of a sovereign god who knows everything and can do whatever he wants. And so we see that in the result turning out the way that it does. There already have been, and there are just so many more little things like this, where even when a poor Goral, a die, a lot, any object of Cleromancy isn't specifically mentioned in the Book of Esther, it still is. Surely when I did my summary on the Book of Esther, I said, when you visualize this book, picture that die. Surely I did. I don't know that for a fact, but hopefully I did, because it's the perfect image for the entire book. It looks like a thing that determines stuff randomly, but if a die actually exists in a universe created head to toe by a god who is all powerful and knows everything, then that die is not actually an object of randomness. It's actually an object of providence, or at least it is whenever an all-powerful god would choose to use it as such. So many things in the Book of Esther just look like they just happened, and it just went that way. But the ability for the outcome of the Book of Esther to be positive, to be the Jews being spared, and the redemptive plan sustained is such an unlikely outcome that required so many little roles of the die coming up, sixes coming up, you know, whatever the desirable number is in this illustration, that it ends up looking like the best explanation for the whole thing. And this is that there is an unseen force waving his hand over the top of the die, both literally and metaphorically in these particular high stakes narrative forks in the road throughout Esther to get the outcome that he desires. So if that theme wasn't super pronounced yet, it now very much is, as we're getting here into the middle of Esther chapter three. All right, yesterday I said that was the end of all the dice talk. Now I think that's actually the end of all of the dice talk. Next time around we're going to look at Heyman going to pitch this plan. He's got all lined up to King Xerxes. And we'll see how that goes in the next conversation. All right, thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
