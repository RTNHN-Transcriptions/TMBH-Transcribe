We're all getting in a stab because we're all going to have a hand in this and we're all going to own it. I don't want like just one guy running in there ahead of everybody else and being like, I'm getting in all the stabs myself right away. Everybody gets a stab. Everybody needs to walk out of there with blood on the knife because it needs to be very clear that we all had a hand in this and that this wasn't some rogue actor. This was a comprehensive bipartisan rejection of this tyrant, Julius Caesar, and we're all going to own it in front of everybody. Likewise, I think Matthew is giving us a scenario like that, but with a very different tone in Matthew 27 and what we're going to see in the final chapter 28 that's coming up, it's becoming really clear that everybody has a knife in their hand. All these different parties and groups have some kind of ownership here. I mean, over the last couple of days, we've talked about the ambiguity and confusion that people have felt sometimes for very nefarious reasons over the centuries about who's really to blame for this thing. When in reality, it shouldn't be very difficult at all. Matthew and the rest of the Bible are making it super clear that the people responsible for the death of Jesus of Nazareth is everybody. Everybody's got a knife in their hand. Everybody's getting in a stab just like what happened with the conspirators who killed Julius Caesar. The common Roman gets in a stab as legionnaires, executioners actually put Jesus on the cross. The Roman governmental system gets in a stab. Roman political cowardice gets in a stab. Dirty corrupt Jewish religious leadership gets in a stab, maybe two or three. Matthew goes out of his way in chapter 27 to give us a sense that some of the common men in the crowd from the Jewish side of things, they get in a stab. But heck, one sixth of Jesus' disciples even kind of get in a stab. Judah sells him out completely and Peter bales under pressure, five-sixths of the disciples scatter off to who knows where with only John making a vague appearance here or there. The fickleness of the crowds gets in a stab and I suppose along with that, the human tendency to chase after trends and fads and the latest news cycle and the tyranny of whatever is new and fashionable gets in a stab. The historic religious leadership who persecuted the messengers that God sent before, they get in a stab. The Samaritans who rejected Jesus and didn't want him to come to their village, they, I suppose, get in a stab. The people on the far side of the Sea of Galilee who didn't want anything to do with them are like, get out of here, weirding us out with all of your demon casting outing. They get in a metaphorical stab. The pseudo-Jewish kings who were really descended from rival kingdoms of Israel, so those old tribes that were a thorn in the side of the Jewish people back in the Old Testament, they get in a stab through their representatives in the Herod family. And then as we've discussed so much, all of humanity, past, present and future, gets in a stab because of the disease and plague and wilfulness and intentionality that is sin. You might have listened to yesterday's episode and you were thinking like, well, but wait a minute. Sin is handed down to everybody through Adam and Eve according to the Bible, according to what we read over in Romans. Then why isn't it possible that sin could just be handed down from that crowd in Matthew 27, 25 from one Jewish generation to the next for all of ever and ever in all time. But one of the key differences there is that it isn't just Adam and Eve who chose sin. It's everybody. According to the Bible, everybody just keeps picking it and we don't need really any generational help on that. We do it ourselves. And I suppose if a Jewish person or anybody chose to reject Jesus, that would be their own choice. Maybe they are re-upping a generational trend, but that is then the decision of the descendant and not the person who declares it one time in a courtyard somewhere. Here's what I'm driving at. If we try to simplify this whole thing down to one root cause of why Jesus got killed and that thing that we come up with is in some way political or ethnic or conspiratorial limited to a few people who have been dead for two millennia at this point. I just don't think we're reading the story properly. The problem that Jesus is defeating here is not bad Jewish politics. It's not bad Roman politics. It's not the Roman occupation. It's not poverty. It's not poor living conditions in urban areas. It's not even societal ills and injustices. Those some of those things are definitely addressed and straightened out by the effect of the reality of the kingdom. No, first and foremost, the text is clear. Jesus is here in alignment with the will of his father to bring glory to his father. And he's doing that by playing the pivotal role in God's redemptive plan. What's being defeated here is sin and death, a much bigger target and a much bigger problem, much bigger fish to fry than all of the things that from our world kingdom perspective we might obsess about as we read through the text. There's a spirit of the age. There's a mindset that is on display here as we read through Matthew that at first is grotesque and how foreign and awful it seems like things must have been back then. But the longer we read it, the more we realize that it's not a painting of a distant time. It's a mirror that we're looking in that is reflective of our own time and our own motives and our own self. And as we get to the end of Matthew, well, we realize these problems have been going off for a long time. Humanity has a very distinctive brokenness to it that keeps repeating itself in all cultures in all places. There's a disease that wrecks us. There's a temptation that we can't resist. There's a test that we can't pass. And the underlying spiritual issue behind all of it, according to the text here, is this resistance of the king, resistance of the kingdom, resistance to God, a desire to elevate oneself to that position or to elevate things that we make, organizations that we build, whatever it might be to that place. But ultimately those things are all corruptible, but the king and the kingdom are not corruptible. Jesus is coming to defeat then is so much bigger than any of the human characters or their foibles or selfishness. Jesus is playing a completely different game than them with completely different stakes that they're not thinking about, that they can't comprehend. And it explains why Jesus is like, forgive them. They know not what they do. They just, there's a pity here. Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem. I wanted to gather you under my wings. They just don't get it. We just don't get it. And if he were here today, he'd be playing a different game than I'm playing, a different game than we're playing. So then part of the reason that this Matthew stuff, this whole story of Jesus is so compelling and why thousands of years after the fact here we've been talking about it so much, is that one, there is this sense that literally everyone has a hand on the metaphorical knife and that literally everyone is getting in a stab. Literally everyone, according to the Bible, bears responsibility for Jesus going to the cross, but another part of the reason that it's so compelling is that Jesus is playing by such a totally different set of ground rules. What is valuable to him? What is a win for him? What would be a loss for him is so totally different than how we're wired and how we think the otherness of it, the collective nature of our guilt, the fact that all of humanity is presented as having taken part in the evil, the wrong, the messed up stuff that sent Jesus to the cross effectively builds unity across the ages for all of humanity and that we share this problem and we share this responsibility. It should make it harder for us to remain proud. And when that is contrasted with this person who rises above ethnicity or one local story to address the entirety of the human problem, what you get is the story that transcends all other stories and accomplishes the rare wonder of transporting any reader from any time in any language out of that human place of blame and finger pointing. And this is that person's fault and I'm better than you to a place of shared collective humility for our role in the brokenness of the world, the brokenness of humanity and shared gratitude for the role that Christ has held out as playing to resolve that thing that we cannot fix for ourselves. I really think those are the emotions. I really think that's the orientation that this unjust debacle of a series of events in Matthew 27 is supposed to take us to. I said it yesterday, but today I really mean it next time around, we're moving forward in the story. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
