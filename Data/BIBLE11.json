Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about first Kings. Hey, my friends, it's Matt. This is a 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. I want to start with a thought exercise here. Let's imagine that the United States was founded a hundred years before it actually was, if you like a dinner party or something where you get together and listen to podcasts, and you want to impress everybody, you just blurt out what that year would be now. Your window for impressing people has now closed. So we're going to say the United States started in 1676 for this exercise. And now we're going to imagine that right now, as you're listening to this, we're going to decide to write a summary and an evaluation of all the people who ever served as presidents of the United States. Well, there's a couple of obvious questions. We got a tackle before we put pen to paper here, right? And number one, how much detail are we going to go into? How long is this book going to be? And well, let's say we're going to keep it pretty succinct. So we're not going to be able to get into lots of detail on these guys' lives because we're more interested in how good a job they did, which leads to question number two. Wow, good a job they did based on what criteria. I suppose there are a lot of different ways that we could evaluate that, but we've got to come up with criteria that transcends these 400 years stuff that would apply equally to everybody. So we're going to go big picture. And these are the three questions that in this exercise, we're going to evaluate based on number one, were they loyal to the United States of America? Or were they loyal to some other nation or were they bribable, corruptible, were they just loyal to themselves, some kind of political mercenary? We're going to gauge them on that number two, were they just toward their subjects? Did they care about the people they governed? Did they serve the people they governed? And number three, did they stick to the ground rules to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the civil liberty principles upon which the whole country was founded? Or did they just blow past all of that stuff to do whatever they were going to do? Now, maybe some of you were already starting to feel it right now. And you're like, ah, I'm uncomfortable though, because who's writing this book? Is it going to be somebody from a political persuasion that I don't like? Because they're going to get the evaluation all wrong. It's going to be stupid. Look, I can't speak to that part. And I'm not going to get into like who's right and who's wrong. I don't know. Okay. I know that was a lot, but we finally just got to where I wanted to be. If all of that made sense, then first and second Kings are going to make a ton of sense as well. Just like first and second Samuel, they're one book that gets divided up because of scroll length and other questions about the media on which they were written down and transmitted. We don't know who wrote these two books. Some people think it was Jeremiah, maybe Ezra. I'm not sure it's very important that it be one person or a well-known name. But even if somebody wanted to vigorously make the case and now I was written by this one big name character, that one big name character, you would still have to acknowledge because of evidence internal to the text that there were other contributors and that that author or editor was drawing on some old sources, older stuff that was written down. Because again, we're covering like 400 years here, think about what you were doing 400 years ago. This is a big swath of time that has to be taken into account here and it makes sense that there might be more than one contributor to this whole thing. But in terms of what the project is, it's just like the one that you and I were talking about someone coming from a very specific set of assumptions, a very specific angle is setting out to give us the story of Judah and eventually Israel. There's a split that happens early on here that we're going to talk about in just a second. But this somebody is trying to give us a big overview of the history of this era of God's chosen people using the reign of each of the kings as a benchmark, as a storytelling tool to walk us through it. And we know that this someone has an angle because we can detect it in the pages and that angle is that they seem very persuaded by what they read in the first five books of the Old Testament, particularly Deuteronomy. There's a bunch of nods to Deuteronomy in first and second kings. And if you recall from when we were just working on the book of Deuteronomy a few days ago, it centers around this second giving of the law. The old generation wandered around in the desert and they don't get to go in to Canaan, but the new generation is ready to go in and take Canaan and old man Moses lays it all out again, like, here, this is what you got to do. This is what the law says. This is what God wants. This is what the covenant is and then he renews the covenant with this new generation before they follow Joshua into the promised land. And as we've already talked about so many times, what is that covenant? Well, the one that God made with Moses is I'm going to be your God. You're going to be my people and everybody's going to know that I'm your God and you're my people because when you obey me, I'm going to bless you. And when you disobey me, I'm going to punish you. So whoever is putting together first and second Kings is really into that and is trying to stress to some future generations of Israelite, of Jewish people, hey, look back at our history and look at it through the lenses of what God did before we even had a land. Look at it through the lenses of the law and the covenant that God made. Look at how much we blew it. Look at how our leaders did not handle their business overwhelmingly correctly and look at what that cost us, which ultimately is going to be the wholesale defeat of God's chosen people and then being hauled off into captivity. That's where first and second Kings are going to end. So then the structure of the book is real straightforward. It's just like the one that you and I imagined putting together for all of the hypothetical presidents of a 400 year old hypothetical United States of America. We get introduced to a king either of the southern kingdom or northern kingdom again, more on that in a minute. Then we get told either very little about what they did or a great deal about what they did and we just see an evaluation based on three criteria. Number one was the king loyal to God and God alone. Number two, did the king promote the worship of God and God alone amongst his people or did the king allow idolatry to run rampant and finally did that king honor the law of God? Was he committed to the deal that God made with Moses, did he honor God and keep his commands? Over the course of first and second Kings, depending on how you count it all, we're going to see roughly 40 Kings evaluated in this manner. Now, maybe at this point you're like, hey, well, when do we get the summary? Because the summaries are kind of fun. Well, the answer to your question, my friend is right now is when you get the summary. It opens with David is an old man picking up right where we left off in second Samuel and just like those last four cryptic chapters of second Samuel where we see the good stuff about David and the bad stuff about David, so we get the same thing at the beginning of first Kings. It is clear that Solomon is going to win out and he is going to sit on his father's throne and much like old man Moses making his parting words to his people and old man Joshua making his parting words to his people that they should follow God and be faithful and loyal to him. So old man David does the same thing with Solomon except then right after he gets to his father's and saying all that beautiful stuff, old man David's like also, there's some murder and that still needs to be done. I got some people or I don't feel like we've squared up account to keep an eye on them. They're trouble. I'm telling you kid. They're trouble. It'd be better if you could go ahead and make sure that they die, you know, die. And so Solomon follows through on these weird grudges and this bizarre hit list he gets from David at the end of his life and opens his reign with a bunch of assassinations. You ever heard of that sword of Damocles principle? This is another tradition. This is Greek, but it's a story. I think it comes from the island of Syracuse. I could be wrong on that. But it's a story about this sword that is hung by a little single thread of horse hair over somebody who imagines that they could rule better than the king. And pretty quickly the guys like, I don't want to rule. I don't want to rule. Take me out from under this sword and the sword is a metaphor for all of the ick that one has to engage in to achieve that kind of power to obtain the throne in the first place. And then it prevents one from ruling with a clear mind and ruling with a clean heart because you got all that stuff in the rear view mirror. Well, that's sort of Damocles principle, which again, it's like it's not in the Bible. The idea comes through. It really plays out with how things work for Solomon. Solomon initially looks like he makes some pretty not wise decisions in keeping with his dad's advice. But then God shows up and was like, Hey, what do you want? And Solomon's like, I want to be better fit for this job. It's clear that a big part of what I'm doing here paraphrases mine. It involves judgment and trying to get justice right. And based on what Solomon asks, he apparently doesn't feel totally equipped for that. He's like, I want wisdom. And God's like, cool. I really, really like that that's what you asked for instead of superpowers or long life again. Paraphrase is totally mine. And so he grants Solomon this amazing wisdom. And that's quickly demonstrated in a famous decision that he makes about a dispute over who is the true mother of a child. And then shortly thereafter, God sees through the promise that was made to Solomon's father, David, about building this temple. And Solomon indeed sees through the construction of this magnificent temple. And this is one of the places where we see the Deuteronomy connections or really the Pentateuch connections in general. There's a massive aside here where it spells out all kinds of details like right down to a couple of pillars that even get given first names in terms of how the temple was built, the business dealings behind it, all of the materials that were used, the dimensions, the artwork. It's beautiful. It's fascinating. I don't know if we get any other accounts. This detailed of any ancient buildings off the top of my head. This one is amazing and much like God's presence physically shows up at the dedication, the completion of the tabernacle back in the day. So God's spirit shows up at the end of this massive elaborate sacrificial public festival at the dedication of the temple. The text holds out God as being straight up in that temple dwelling among his people. So that's kind of a big deal. Seems like things are going well, but much like last time I said something like that in a previous episode, then things start going not well. Then Solomon falls for a bunch of women who worship other gods and he wobbles in his dedication to the God that he just built this amazing temple for. There's a judgment pronounced against Solomon at the end, I believe, of chapter 11. And then at the beginning of, I think, chapter 12, the son of Solomon, Reabom, he wrecks everything. I mean, he doesn't even get out of the gate. And he's like, okay, how should I reign? I know with an iron fist and then all of the tribes of the north are like, nah, they were just not doing it. And they leave. They bail completely. And now there are two kingdoms, Judah in the south and Israel in the north in the south. Jerusalem continues to be the main hub religiously and politically in the north. There are a few different religious and political centers, but there's some weird stuff that goes on up there that looks like idolatry. And that just sets the tone for how the reigns of the kings of the north go. It's ugly, perhaps none uglier than King Ahab and his wife Jezebel, who are murderous and occasionally try to exploit God when it's helpful for them. But mostly they just chase after dark stuff. And it's in the context of their reign that we meet the first rock star prophet that we've seen in a long time. In a way, this is the guy who introduces us to a whole new era of prophets. These are the prophets who speak into the era of the kings. And his name is Elijah. And eventually we get to know that he has a successor named Elijah, more on that when we get into second kings. But in first Kings, Elijah has a showdown with Ahab, the king of the north's beloved prophets of Baal. And God shows up and Baal doesn't show up. Baal's a local Canaanite deity. And God looks awesome. Elijah looks awesome. And the Abb ends up looking like an idiot. And first Kings ends with a bunch of the prophecies of doom pronounced by Elijah against Ahab and Jezebel coming to pass their reign ending and a new rhythm being established from a literary perspective that we're going to carry with us into second Kings where you've got these questionable rulers, most of whom turn out to be a total flop. All of the northern Kings in fact fail that threefold test that I brought up a little bit earlier. But this new structure that we see is we get an account of how those Kings fail or occasionally in the south get it right. And their prophets, they're speaking into the situation. And then of course, as we get further into the Old Testament, we're going to reconnect with some of those prophets as we get some of what they had to say set against the historical backdrop that we're reading about in first and second Kings. What does that mean for God's promise to redeem everything and establish this king and this kingdom, all the things he promised to David and Abraham, well, we'll turn the page into second Kings. We'll see how this thing plays out and we'll try to get a better sense of it from there. All right. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
