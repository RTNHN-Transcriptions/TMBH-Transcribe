This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and if this is your first time ever here, you've arrived at the second episode in our brand new season on the book of Philemon. You don't know anything about this podcast at all. So I figured I'd just bring you up to speed real quick on what we're doing here and then we'll do some young Bible history Philemon stuff. My name is Matt Whitman and I am fascinated by the Bible and Christianity and expressions of Christianity that are different from my own. I am a Christian and I do think God is behind the Bible and that it's reliable and that it's accurate and I find this book to be incredibly compelling. I was raised around Christianity and that it really went great. My parents were and our wonderful dad was a pastor. He's retired now. He was great at it. It was a good upbringing but like so many people in that millennial Gen X age window, we have foot on both sides of this stunning technological divide in the grand history of everything. We were raised in the not technology or not internet era but then the whole world changed with social media and the internet and the smartphones and now machine learning and AI and everything being dictated by algorithms and feeds. It's one of the most dramatic changes that has ever happened in the history of the world and that happened right between my childhood and my adulthood, the family man age of my life. It's jarring to a lot of us and it messed with our brains and it messed with our hearts and I think there are a whole lot of people like me who went through a pretty serious faith crisis at some point after being raised around Christianity and belief. And for me that was a very difficult time. There's a lot that went into that. Maybe someday I'll tell you more about it. Ultimately, I guess you could say I did come out of it. I went from a state of belief to not belief to belief. Let me tell you. For one thing, that makes me really empathetic to people who don't believe in God. People who would like to believe in God but just can't muster it. Maybe there's too many questions. Maybe I don't know. There are lots of reasons that that can be a difficult thing. Faith can be difficult. It also makes me really empathetic to people who don't believe in God and don't really have any intention to at this time. I would like just so that you know, full disclosure, I would like all of you to believe in God. I would like all of you to be Christians. However, I love the fact that there are a bunch of you here who are not and who maybe you don't know what to make of that and you're kind of sizing it up right now. Maybe you're just here out of empathy for people in your life who are Christians and you want to understand them better and you want to understand their lore and their sacred book and their history better. If that's why you're here, by the way, you're awesome. That is incredibly gracious and forward thinking of you to be willing to invest time to understand the people you love better. Also I hope you become a Christian later. Also I'm not going to manipulate you into doing it. I feel empathy and I understand what it's like to be in a place of not belief and I understand what it's like to be in a place of belief. For me, I am fascinated by the Bible. I'm super curious to better understand all the time what people have seen in this. Why is this the most popular thing that ever got written down in the history of humankind? Why did it stick? Why is it so good when I read it? Why is it that it hangs together so well and seems to be so cohesive despite being written over 1400 or 1500 years? That's incredible to me by different people who speak different languages. I'm absolutely fascinated by the story. I'm fascinated by the ripple effect that comes out of the Bible and out of the life of Jesus of Nazareth through history. I love pinch zooming in on little moments, little spots in the Bible, little spots in the history of the world and Christianity to try to understand how it all fits together and how it works there. The reason I do this podcast is because I heard a rumor there were other people like you who might be interested in the same kind of stuff and that you might like to have a little bit of a laugh about things while you were at it and that you might not have a ton of time and so you might like to just have a few minutes every day where you just keep chipping away at it and work with somebody who is frankly pretty excited about this stuff and pretty eager to connect with you every day to talk about what's next. This podcast exists. We do 10-ish minutes of content every weekday and we pick a book of the Bible and we just go right through it. If you were here for yesterday's opening episode on Philemon, then you know that Philemon is the book of the Bible that we picked. We got 66 books here in this Bible that I have in front of me and Philemon might seem to some of you who are in the know or have been around church or Christianity for a long time to be an odd pick because it's so dang short. It's not quite the shortest book in the whole Bible, but it's close. It only has 25 verses in the Bible of verse isn't always a sentence, but it's roughly a verse is kind of a sentence-ish in length usually. It's not like 25-ish sentences. Dang, that's not that much. So why would we pick a teeny tiny little book that we could probably read in 60 seconds together to do an entire season on? And I'm prepared to answer that. Is any book of the Bible that we pick, I am picking strategically as a launching point into other things that I think are interesting. And the guy who wrote the book of Philemon is a very, very significant Bible character, a very significant character in the history of Christianity. And I mean, come on, a top 10 influential character in the history of humankind, maybe? He's a big deal. His name is the Apostle Paul. Anytime you see a church, it's called like St. Paul's or if you've been to Minnesota, they got a St. Paul there. It's that St. Paul, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and the same guy, St. Paul, St. Paul, St. Paul. He wrote more books of the Christian New Testament than any other author. And basically everything we get from him is in the form of letters that he wrote to either people he was working with to help establish Christian communities around the ancient Roman empire, or it's a letter he wrote directly to that Christian community, usually one that he helped found to help them out with the problem that they were having. And they all had problems. Like, what do you know? It was hard to start Christianity. And what do you know? The people who got invited to Christianity were all weird and insecure and had problems like everybody else does, like you or me. And those didn't just instantly go away as soon as they became Christians, because people are people. And so Paul was constantly giving guidance to these people. So every book of the New Testament written by Paul is very interesting to me, because they're all born out of a different tension, a different moment that gives me the opportunity to pinch zoom in and see people from the distant past who do look a lot like me in their flaws, maybe even in some of their good stuff, and to learn about their part of the world on the map, to learn about their culture, to learn about their peculiarities. And quirks and weaknesses and to learn from them, from their mistakes, from their successes. It also gives me the opportunity to launch off of that into other big chunks of the Bible that might be more intimidating to go and study if we just picked those. It also gives me opportunities to launch off of these little parts of the Bible that we picked to go and look at big, giant movements in history that'll just help us understand the world better and help us understand the Bible better. Philemon is interesting to me precisely because it is so tight and in just 25 verses, the Apostle Paul is trying to out maneuver and overcome an unwinnable situation. And the situation being addressed in Philemon is a legit problem for the ages as discussed yesterday. Now, one of the biases that you and I have got to get passed really early on here to ring all of the value out of the time we're about to spend in Philemon is we got to get passed our sense that old things were dumb and trite, but new things are very, very important. It is easy when we study history. And I do mean we like me too. It's easy to imagine that the social crises of the past were so dumb and silly and trivial and trite. Oh, you people, you were so worried about all these things. And what people thought back then, well, now you're all dead and nobody even remembers. So I guess it didn't matter. Yeah, but think about the things that you and I feel pressure about now. Does it matter? Yes, it matters. Those things, social pressure is real pressure. We might make fun of the politics of the past and just try to fight like, oh, they were so worried about this Roman political fellow who had aspirations to defeat that Roman political fellow. Oh, and they debated and people got very upset and they wore their little hats and they did graffiti and whatnot. Oh, they were so dumb back then worrying about things like that. We worry about things like that. Our politics matter. Whatever moment you live in, the social pressures you feel, they're real and they should be taken seriously when we look back on it. Whatever moment in history you live in, the political realities you contend with, the legal realities you contend with, they're real and they should be taken seriously. Well, the book of Philemon invites us into a very real set of social, political and legal pressures, institutional pressures within a fledgling church. So here's what we're going to do over the next few days or a couple of weeks or whatever. We're going to go and try to get a really good sense of the Roman political realities of the day, a little crash course on the bloody fascinating, colorful, flamboyant, corrupt characters that occupied the role of emperor leading up to this time and during this time. And then we're going to look at some of the laws that were in place, some of the cultural realities that were in place in this moment in the history of Rome. Then we're going to go and track down Paul and we're going to see where he went and why he went there and what his situation were and what was going on with these little churches, particularly the one in Colossae, which is the church in view. And then we're going to get up to speed on Paul's specific situation when he makes the decision to pull the trigger on right in this letter and sending it to try to do something about this difficult situation. So we are firmly set up to get into deep dive background mode here over the next little bit. If you've never done anything like this before and this moment in history is intimidating to you, be not intimidated. We're going to make it fun. And over the next few days, we're going to get a solid foundation for all of this stuff, even if you happen to be new to it. Okay, this concludes my two day intro pitch on why I'm excited about Feileiman tomorrow. We are getting down to business on the background stuff. All right, I'm Matt.
