This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and you understand the principle, right? Of having somebody who is guarding a vulnerable position for you and you got to trust them to have your back, so to speak, in that regard, because when you're trying to do things out front, you're vulnerable back there and so you find somebody you really can count on to take care of that to make sure that horrible things don't unfold back there. It's a rear guard. It's really important in American football. The left tackle is a very important position. That's a blocker who protects the quarterback. That's the person who usually throws the ball and a right-handed quarterback. They've got their back, generally speaking, to the position that the left tackle protects. You want somebody over there at left tackle who is of high character, high athletic skill, high football IQ, because the quarterback needs to be comfortable and no, they have got my back. If you understand this principle of a rear guard and what it is to maybe play that role yourself or have somebody do that for you, then you also understand what a great opportunity there is for the person in that position to injure you should they choose to quit guarding. That is a position of massive trust. Throughout the history of everything, we've got stories about someone who was trusted to provide a rear guard who intentionally betrayed the person they were protecting. Historically, in all cultures, this is pretty much universally regarded as the most reviled character archetype in all storytelling. You got the guy who let the Persians in to the back way to go and defeat Leonidas and the 300 Spartans who were holding the pass at Thermopylae. You got your Benedict Arnold. I mean, Benedict Arnold, that name is kind of the epitome of person who lets down the rear guard. You've got Aaron Burr who tried to sell America back to Britain. Did you know this? Then I tried to raise an army. I was going to meet the Brits in the Western frontier and reconquer the thing and become like Emperor of America. He had a whole deal worked out. Didn't pan out that way. That guy was a jerk, but that's just what we think of people who violate that sacred trust, that brotherhood, that sisterhood in that way. And maybe even more than Benedict Arnold, the most betray the sacred trust that is assigned to the rear guard character in the history of ever is Judas Iscariot. And Judas Iscariot comes up in this little passage right here in Matthew 26. That goes loosely. Here it is. Starting verse 14. Then one of the 12, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and asked, What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you? So they counted out for him 30 silver coins from then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over him, of course, being Jesus on its own. That's just grotesque on a bajillion levels. In context, you can see Matthew warming us up to the idea that that is coming. And in context, it's sort of stunning to realize the thing that pushes him over the edge. So let's start by thinking about that. And the next time we'll look a little more closely at who Judas is and what else we know about him from the text. But just look at this initiating event that causes the betrayal. If we go back just a little bit, what do we have before this? Oh, yeah. The chief priests and everybody, they're mad. They're trying to figure out a plan to kill Jesus. And then Jesus goes to Bethany. Remember? And he's out there at the home of Simon the leper and they're having this meal and some lady, the text here doesn't specify who comes and breaks open that alabester jar. And just dumps out like a whole inheritance worth of perfume, like crazy money perfume on Jesus and the disciples, Matthew records somewhat discreetly were offended. And they were indignant and like, why this waste perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor. And then Jesus responds to them with the stuff we've been looking at for the last few days. Like, I'm always going to be with us. Why are you trampling this woman's beautiful moment? Like she gets it and you guys don't get it as much as you should get it. And then he props her up and is like her legacy is going to be huge. Like this will always be told as part of the story of the gospel, part of the story of what happened here. And then the very next thing is what I just read you, Judas is scary it because trader of all time, he goes and immediately sells Jesus out. Well, what part of what happened there at Bethany? Do you think pushed him over the edge? I don't know the answer to that. I'm kind of thinking of it as we talk here. I suppose option number one would be that Judas is scary. It is the one who is the loudest. And he got called out the most directly by Jesus and Judas is scary it maybe had real thin skin and sometimes people with thin skin who lack the courage to address a perceived slight on the fly will hold on to those things and then look for an opportunity to wound you back as you have wounded them. Maybe that's what we're getting with Judas. A guy who really loved Jesus and liked him, but he wasn't the favorite and he wanted to be the favorite and he didn't know how to be the favorite. And so he thought he'd said something really spiritually smart and he kind of fired off his bullet here and he was the one leading the charge and he looked dumb and unlike Peter who could just ram his head against the wall like Gus Ferat again and again and again and keep coming back from it and be like, Oh, yeah, stupid. Oh, dang it. My bad. Okay, I'll do better next time. We should build hot snow with the hot. Oh, dang it. Okay, I'll do better next time Peter just seems to have been very thick skinned and very teachable and never got overly discouraged by the correction that he kept receiving. Judas is scary. It gets like the slightest ounce of pushback here and maybe he just wilts. That could be the reason that immediately he goes and does this. Now, I mean, look, obviously Matthew has editorial control here and he chose to roll right from this incident at Bethany right in to Judas's betrayal. Then, I mean, kind of like right after that, one of the 12 goes and does this thing. So Matthew, I mean, the subtle literary hints, the editorial organizational hints suggest that he was convinced reading the room that Judas is scary. It did this thing in direct response at the deal of Bethany is what pushed him over the edge. Maybe he just didn't like ladies. I don't know, like different views of men and women and for us in this day and age to have somebody be like, no, this lady gets it more right than you do. I mean, I know there are exceptions, you got ladies who kind of hate men, you got men who maybe think they're way better than ladies. I think the vast majority, the bell curve at this point is kind of like, yeah, men and women are a little bit different. People are pretty cool. And I don't know. Some ladies are real good at stuff. Some dudes are real good at stuff like whatever. I think that's mostly where we are. But man, we can't even imagine the sting that that would have had back then given the way gender roles worked. And maybe it was the fact that some woman got it right and Judas didn't that he just couldn't handle and he broke over that deep cultural insult that he felt had been given him in front of everybody else. Maybe that was just too much. Option number three, maybe the Bethany thing didn't play as much of a role as I'm ascribing to Matthew's organization and narrative flow here. Maybe it is just natural that the story of Judas initiating the betrayal came next because that's what the timeline was. Maybe this is something Judas was going to do absolutely all along. And the reason he was going to do it is because something broke in Judas's heart a long time ago and he'd always intended to steal everything. Maybe he would have liked it way better if that jar of alabaster perfume had just been donated to some kind of do future nice things for the poor donation and with Judas being in charge of the money. And Jesus saying I'm about to die and everything looking like Jesus is about to die. Maybe Judas was like, well, I mean, when he dies, there's going to be chaos. And in that moment, I can abscond with the whole treasury of things we were going to give to the poor. And that stupid jar of perfume was worth more money than everything we have on hand by like a lot. And she just wasted it. And that was actually like you're pouring out my money on him right now. That was my money. That's going to be my money. And like 48 hours. What are you doing? You stupid woman. Maybe that's what he was feeling. But whatever you make of that, one thing that is very notable is the price that Judas ultimately ends up landing on time wise. We'll get into that next time around. I suppose what I'm trying to say though is maybe Judas had some very complex emotional dad issue gender insecurity. Mad about women, misogyny, complex mess of things going on side brain and sad little heart that caused him to do something that's just grotesque on the grandest scale of historical rear guard betrayals of trust, historical sellouts. We do just really, really liked money. But I think when we look closely at how cheap the price was, I think that bolsters the suggestion that now this was more about the revenge act even than the money. But again, that's something we got to break down in more depth to come to any kind of informed verdict on next time around. In the meantime, I got some stuff I want to say quickly. I want to say thank you very much. So all of you support the program and to all of you who have supported the program for a while, but tapped out here in the last month. That is completely reasonable. Signing up to support a podcast on the internet is not a lifelong commitment. And I'm just encouraged by the fact that you did that for any amount of time whatsoever. The thought means the world. Sometimes you shoot me a note or something. Golly, that's just kind. I mean, it feels like kind of a one way medium sometime. And that back and forth is meaningful and appreciated and it's just super important to me that I say and that you understand that it is never weird between us when it comes time to tap out. Thank you so much for the encouragement. Thank you so much for the support. And I'm glad that we hang out here and we get to do this together. That's great. It's normal. That's awesome. I also want to say thank you to the number of you who have started doing the thing where you just go to the website. You're like, you know what? I don't know. I don't really do the Patreon account thing, but I'm kicking in five bucks. Like, golly, what a thoughtful thing. And I see that note and just a cool pick me up in the middle of the day. When something like that comes in, this podcast exists because of all of you to all the rest of you. We're like, I don't really want to kick in on a free podcast. That is an infinitely reasonable decision for you to make. And I don't ever want you to feel like you have to. So I'm super glad you're here. I'm super glad we get to do it. You can't tell this probably from where you're sitting, but this is the first time that I have recorded a podcast in several weeks because I did a whole bunch before I went on a trip with my wife. And I've missed you. And it's just really nice to be back sitting in front of this microphone, talking with a small percentage of you who I know in some way and a whole bunch of you who I don't know, except for through this. And I appreciate all of you and from time to time, I just like to make sure you know that. All right. That's what I got. More on this Judas Iscariot thing, manana. I'm Matt.
