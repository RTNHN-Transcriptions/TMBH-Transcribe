But they don't have the courage to make that all happen in front of everybody and totally own their decisions. They're going to wait to play their hand until a little bit later on. And it's been really fun gaming out here, why they're making the moves they're making and how they're making the moves that they're making. So let's pick it up from yesterday with this. Fast forward over here to chapter 26 once again. And it says that they have to go about this thing in a sly way. They're having a secret meeting in a place nobody else is allowed to go the palace of the high priest. And as they do so, they're saying, okay, look, we can't make this arrest at the wrong time because we get the country come to town crowd and they're not going to like it because he has support among that crowd. So we got to carry out this arrest in a way that's clever. It's off the books. It's out of the public eye. And that's something I just had never thought about before. You got a role on your side. You got your like probably temple guard thing or whatever you have there. I mean, you certainly have people who can work with you. I mean, they showed up in the garden later on to go and be a little bit of muscle. I just go wander through the streets Jerusalem fine. Jesus doesn't have to be complicated. It's be like you're under arrest for being a blasphemer and blaspheming the temple. And you're going to have to come with us and we're going to put you on trial should be easy. But they didn't know what kind of reaction they were going to get out in public. They weren't sure how it was going to play and they're trying to protect their position. Like, okay, well, we can't do it in a way that could risk a riot because then Rome will be mad at us like the biggest thing they went from us is just no riots. And that's like the one threat we have the one card we can play to put pressure on them. We don't want to waste it on this thing when it wasn't a riot of our making. Now I'm going to be clever with how we do this arrest. And that's why ultimately they find a real weasily way to arrest him out of the public eye. But Jesus knew that he could have avoided the arrest if he wanted to. He was doing what he wanted to be doing in the place he wanted to be doing it when he got arrested. If you really think about Caiaphas's position, he sort of only got two options and he's painted into a corner here. Option number one is do nothing out of fear of the country come to town folk who like Jesus. And you just let the thing ride. Let Jesus say the stuff he's going to say do the stuff he's going to do. But he's right there in the temple. He's talking about his father. He flipped over the tables and acted like he owned the place. We can't let it go. But one option would be let it slide. But that's not going to work out for Caiaphas because he can see the direction this is going. Jesus is one dude. It would probably be far cheaper in Caiaphas's mind for the Romans to go and strike a deal with Jesus. If the whole world goes after him religiously, you could just buy him and he's going to be way cheaper than the cost of buying all of the religious establishment and leadership. And I have to imagine that Caiaphas is projecting on Jesus his own motivations and imagines and maybe Jesus would like to strike a deal with the Romans. Who knows? He hasn't denounced the Romans. Maybe he's trying to curry favor. Who could say whatever the case if you're Caiaphas, you can't just let the Jesus thing go unchecked every time he talks. Every time he does something who you are and what you're doing looks more and more irrelevant. More on that in a little bit. Option number two is what Caiaphas ended up going with, which is you just got to kill him. It's not enough to shame him. We tried that route and it failed. Caiaphas no longer has the option available to send out his best and brightest and bearis and humiliate Jesus with some kind of scandal campaign or intellectual shaming campaign or something that demonstrates that all of Jesus teachings are a farce. It should be easy. I mean, he's an uneducated homeless bumpkin from up north. You should be able to crush him with all of your academic elites, but you can't. Every time you try, you just dig in the hole further in the minds of the people and the world of public opinion. It ain't working out. If you want to get rid of Jesus, you're not going to be able to intellectually assassinate him or shame him in front of people. You're going to have to straight up take away his ability to speak and the only way you're going to accomplish that is by murdering him. Well, the chief priest can't just go around murdering people. Theoretically, though eventually they just stoop all the way to that level in the book of Acts. No, theoretically, you need to do a proxy murder with the valid paperwork of the state behind it so that everybody knows that this was entirely legal and that this blood is not on the hands of the high priest and his people who find it terribly regrettable. What had to happen to Jesus of Nazareth? But you know how those Romans are. They just won't tolerate insurrectionists and Jesus was really controversial. He was stirring things up. So what's Kaiapha's is option? Well, viability, only the latter. He's got to kill him or he's got to admit that Jesus is right. And if he admits that Jesus is right, he's got to change everything he's doing. I got one more angle that I want to think about the headspace of the religious leaders from. And I guess we'll save that for next time around real quick. Like I've got a ton of good feedback from those of you who went and checked out the pour over the email list I was telling you about last week where they do a daily email newsletter that shoots pretty much down the middle in terms of giving you the raw details of the stories in super summarized form that everybody's talking about any given day. And then what they do in this newsletter that I like is they put that right alongside some Bible or to offer a kingdom perspective on the stuff that makes us all feel terribly frantic right now for understandable reasons. And so again, it's called the pour over. You can sign up at the pour over dot org. And they didn't sponsor this episode. These are just guys I've gotten to know from around the internet. And I like what they're doing. And I think this is something that you will appreciate. So hey, if you didn't check it out last week, maybe go give it a look. Anyway, that will wrap it up for the day. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
