I understand that if your answer to that is no, that it's a funny question is gimmicky. But if your answer to that is, yeah, actually there's just one time that somebody who they totally wanted to kill me and they maybe even were kind of trying to, that it's more of a horrifying thing that's not a lot of fun for you to relive. So I guess I apologize for framing it the way I did. Most of us are not going to be able to relate to what that feels like, but I guess that all of us can relate to what it feels like to have somebody hate us. I mean, maybe because of fear of consequences, they wouldn't have killed us, but to have somebody just loathe you to have somebody wreck your name in public to have somebody be so utterly soured and poisoned at the proposition of you that there is no chance of that coming back and they will actively do things to damage you. That is a horrible feeling. It's not just horrible because of the fear of what might happen to you. That sense of rejection, it really does hurt, doesn't it? The feeling that even though the person probably is wrong, there's still this outside chance that they're right, that they've looked at you, that they've seen something in your soul, that they've found it wanting and deep down, you're afraid, that maybe they have a point. And that rejection makes this feeling of isolation and loneliness. The other day, my little boy's feet stonky, he doesn't really think he'd feet, but he just did. I mean, it wasn't terrible. It wasn't anything bad. His feet just smelled a little bit. And so we all kind of ribbed him for it because we're a family and we like each other and we do stuff like that, but it got through his armor. And his little heart was hurt. And then we made it right and I patched it up, but I just didn't recognize what was going on there. And the reason when I coached it out of him was he felt my words, not his, rejected. Well, Jesus is in a place in Matthew chapter 12 where he is feeling rejected. Not just like a stinky feet level, go clean yourself up and then we'll hang out, but like, I want to kill you level rejected. And so we get done with two odd controversies about the Sabbath that we spent a couple of weeks trying to explore because I think those stories about the Sabbath are really telling details about the mental state and the motivations of the enemies of Jesus. But it doesn't matter what their mental state was or what their motivations are. I mean, for us, in this point in the narrative in Matthew chapter 12, the bottom line is what came out of it. And what came out of these religious disputes back and forth that Jesus had with these religious leaders is that he or rather his disciples ate some food on the Sabbath. The religious leaders thought they shouldn't have and Jesus healed a guy's hand and the religious leaders thought that could have waited until the next day. And instead of being excited about that healing, verse 14 of Matthew 12 says, but the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. So before I read you the next verse, what would you do? If you did something good and redemptive and not in a vacuum, but something that was at the end of a longstanding feud or point of tension with some significant people in your community, people who others would listen to and follow. And they got to a place where the social sector, this group within the community were like, all right, we just we utterly reject you and we're going to kill you. And what if you got wind of that? What would you do? I mean, seriously, I guess you'd call the police and you're like, Oh, there's some people from the country club who want to murder me. I think could you make them not murder me? I guess you could do that. Would you go and talk to them all one at a time? Would you go on Facebook and try to burn them down and expose them for what they are? Would you weasel like they were weaseling? I mean, that's a technique a lot of us use. You go and try to undermine their support system and their relationships. Would you do that? Maybe if you had the ability, you would just confront them directly in a, Hey, if you're trying to kill me, I'm going to come at you and let's just do this thing and do what may the best man win. Or there's this other option and it's the one that I bet most of you would pick. Maybe half the time it's the one I would pick. Sometimes I'm pretty willing to go and do the let's confront this thing deal, but this other option is very appealing as well. And that's the one where I just back off. It's like, all right, if all you all are going to be like that and we're going to start getting crazy and we're going to escalate this thing, somebody needs to walk away and I've decided it's going to be me. So I'm just going to let you all say the stuff that you're going to say. And I'm just going to live with that because I'm going to go be over here. I think sometimes it's a good course of action. And in this moment, a very human moment in the story of Jesus that we get in the gospel of Matthew, Jesus picks. Yeah, let's fall back. So verse 14 of Matthew 12, but the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. Verse 15, aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him and he healed all their sick, warning them not to tell who he was. This was to fulfill some stuff that the prophet Isaiah said that we're going to look at tomorrow. Look, you know how the story ends. This thing does get sorted out eventually, but rather than having that reckoning right now, Jesus apparently has other things that he'd still like to do and still like to accomplish before we rush right ahead to the whole part where he gets murdered. So he does this strategic withdrawal. And we're going to see this pattern repeat itself as the tension continues to ratchet. This isn't the last time he's going to go elsewhere. In fact, what we're seeing here is a narrative pivot from Jesus being very outward public ministry focused in his little neck of the woods on the north side of the Sea of Galilee to a version of Jesus that seems to be very aware of the inevitability of this now unsolvable strife between him and the religious leadership. This powerful emotional moment in the text because we've reached apparently the end of what a messianic claimant, what even the perfect person with the perfect attitude communicating a message of beauty and love and redemption and hope we've reached the end of what can happen and of what good can come out of it because this is why we can't have nice things because this is what people are going to do. There's this human resistance to this kind of language and this kind of stuff. And so he falls back and he pivots towards pouring his energy into the people who are going to carry the baton after this confrontation with the Pharisees boils up to a point that he will be killed and eventually will be gone physically from this world. And what will be left are these yikes still very raw, very clumsy disciples who clearly have a lot to learn and none of you, but I'm okay at math and I can flip through these pages and I'm like, no, we're approaching the halfway mark here. You're going to get those guys ready. It's kind of now or never. So that is the move that we see happening here. A narrative note that I think is important is that he's warning the people he's healing not to tell people who he is. So the people, they're figuring out what the demons knew from the start. You're the son of God. They get it. You're the Messiah, the Christ, but he's like, let's not exactly articulate all of that now. Is it because he was afraid of dying? Well, I mean, look at what he ends up doing. No, he's clearly not afraid of dying is because it works not done. The people who are going to take over there, they're not ready. There's still things that have to be accomplished before it's time to go to the cross. So that kind of rounds out that narrative question that we grappled with in a couple episodes earlier on about like, well, why is he telling people to be secretive about this? Why not just go around and be like, Jesus is amazing. And he's the Christ. And I've been healed. It's a miracle. Everyone should be happy. Well, because as we've discussed, no, not everybody is going to be happy. Three quarters of the types of people who encounter this are ultimately going to reject it. But I think it's also interesting here how we're seeing that in all of these passages, Jesus is modeling the values of the kingdom articulated on the front end of the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew chapter five in the Beatitudes. And here he's modeling meekness, blessed are the meek. Well, that isn't just him telling people how to be. That's a kingdom value that is reflective of the values of the king. So meekness or power restrained is something that Jesus is up for. It's something that he's going to do. I mean, the incarnation is the epitome of meekness of power restrained. I mean, how many times have you watched the superhero show or Star Wars or something like that? And you're like, ah, main character, seriously, those guys took you and now they're leading off to jail? Like, what is that about? It's ridiculous. It's whoop them. Same thing here. Like Jesus, come on. Like, you can control nature. You can transcend death. You can make matter grow back out of non matter. I mean, whoop them? How hard is it? Well, at this point, nobody really knew his secret ambition, which is to give his life away. And that is still for the glory of his father, what his plan is. He's just got a little bit of stuff that as we discussed a minute ago, he needs to do between now and then. So we have a theological moment here where the one being in all of existence that shouldn't need to be meek is still demonstrating meekness, power, restrained. And we have a narrative moment here where the tension has ratcheted so much that we've got to pivot away from this. We just can't keep having the same conversations banging our heads against the same wall about the Sabbath and stuff again and again, or it's going to accelerate the murder process. And then Jesus will not have accomplished all he needs to accomplish and getting his disciples ready and communicating other things that he needs to communicate before the time is right for him to go to Jerusalem and walk right into a trap that he knows is there and walk effectively straight into the crucifixion entirely voluntarily because he wants to, because it's a plan that he helped design and has been committed to since before time as humans understand it was even initiated. So he's not backing down from a fight. He's not being a coward. He's being true to serpents and innocent as doves here for the greater purpose of the redemptive plan. We'll look more deeply into how the prophet Isaiah and his words fit into this strategic withdrawal here in Matthew 12 15 16 and 17, manana. Thank you so much to everybody who supports the program at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. You do not have to do that, but you do. And it makes this happen.
