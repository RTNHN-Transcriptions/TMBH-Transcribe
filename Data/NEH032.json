And I want to read by you and we'll see what you think about this. It goes like this. If you got some kind of offense between you and another person and it's basically trifling, maybe even a miscommunication or lack of attentiveness, you don't ramp that all the way up with a big formal meeting where you schedule it out. And we need to get together and sit down and work out the thing. I didn't like the way you said that one word in that one phrase that one time we talked a couple of weeks ago, you just try to give them the benefit of the doubt, right? And then when you run into them next time, you find a way to maybe say sort of without saying something that will release the tension and reassure what you think is the point of tension between the two, you make that, you know, assuage it, make it better, or maybe just very casually have a little laugh about him. Like, yeah, the other day when you're hanging out, I said this, you said this, I think we were talking past each other. What I meant to say was this. So sorry if they came out weird, it's been on my mind a little bit. And usually the other person who will also think of it as trifling will match your pace and the thing just gets better. And good luck with that. And I've liked it when people have given me that treatment as well. But sometimes things are a big deal. Sometimes you do need to block out time and sit down and make sure you don't get interrupted. And in those situations, it is maybe worth ratcheting up the tension procedurally by saying I need to meet with you in order to really deal with the issue and ratchet down the tension after that difficult conversation and get to a place of really hard earned peace and relational solidarity moving forward. But generally speaking, if you use the wrong one for the wrong situation, I have found that that is not the best idea. Again, always here to learn, love here and how other people tackle things like this. I know we all think about it. I know that we've all, I mean, we all get sideways with people. Sometimes it's our fault. Sometimes somebody else's, somebody's, somebody's, nobody's fault, whatever. But you know, you think about these things. And really I bring it up because we're looking at a point of relational tension here over the last few chapters we've been looking at at the end of Ezra and into the book we're working on now, which is Nehemiah. You got a point of tension between the Jewish people and their leader, Ezra and God at the end of the book of Ezra. And then you've got relational tension between the returning exiles God shows in people and their leader or soon to be leader Nehemiah and God in Nehemiah chapter one. And in both of these situations, we see them size it up and be like, okay, this isn't really trifling. This isn't like a catch God in the hallway kind of thing. Have a little laugh about stuff, catch up on some other things, reassure each other, give each other the little nod of, we know we just covered that right without really saying anything. Both of these guys run the mental relational calculus and think, no, we got a huge problem here. We have a gigantic relational fissure that is developed. And in the same way that what I described is setting up a meeting with somebody is kind of suing for peace. So that is almost the tone that Ezra takes in preparing to pray to God in, what was that? That was chapter nine, right? And Ezra chapter nine, yes. And that Nehemiah takes in preparation of his prayer to God in Nehemiah chapter one. You remember in chapter nine of Ezra, Ezra comes back, he sees that things are a mess relationally. He kind of does this performative grieving thing. He invites other people into his grief. And it says in Ezra nine, five, then at the evening sacrifice, I rose from myself a basement with my tunic and cloak torn and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord, my God, and prayed. And yesterday I was like, I don't relate to Ezra's prayer as much as I relate to Nehemiah's, but then I went back and I read it last night and I thought, yeah, it's really, really good. And I guess maybe I just don't relate to the role of priest kind of as much as to the variety of hats that Nehemiah wears. But the point is the way Ezra prepares to even go and talk to God is demonstrative of how big a rift he thinks has developed. Well, then time passes between chapter 10, the end of Ezra that is in the beginning of Nehemiah and steps were taken. It's not like nothing happened in there. After that prayer, Ezra went and did some stuff. The Jewish people went and did some stuff and it was costly. It was big stuff. It was a bold move. And now we get to Nehemiah one a little bit of time has passed and quickly within just a few verses we find out things aren't really better. Maybe the problems are a little bit different, but it's all still in jeopardy and things are not right. They're not solved between God and his chosen people relationally. So for the second time in basically two chapters, we get Nehemiah doing the same thing. Verse three, they said to me, these are the people who came back from Jerusalem to report on the state of the city and the people there, quote, those who survived the exile under back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been burned with fire. When I heard these things, it's first person. This is Nehemiah talking now. I sat down and wept for some days. I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. So look, I guess Nehemiah is seen at the same way Ezra saw it. It's a huge rift. This is a jig gantap problem. This is not a catch God in the hallway kind of situation. This is a get my head screwed on straight. Sue for peace. Go to God and be very careful and thoughtful with my words. Do not be interrupted during this time of prayer and really communicate with clarity and intentionality type of situation in both of these cases, Ezra and Nehemiah see a huge problem and they ratchet up the tension for a period of days, even in Nehemiah's case, so that hopefully they can mend the relationship with God or begin to do so. And only then ratchet down the tension, if you will, to kind of stretch the relationship analogy in a human sense. Like I said, raises the question, what does a prayer sound like when you take a few days to prepare it and think about it and consider exactly what you want to say when you are hanging out with God? So this what we get Nehemiah says, Oh Lord, God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands. Let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house, have committed against you. We've acted very wickedly toward you. We've not obeyed to the commands decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses. Well, as always, there's a lot going on here. He opens with covenant language, right? Starts by saying, you are this great and awesome God, you're full of love and you keep your covenant and remember, I mean, the interpretive cipher for so much of understanding the Old Testament. And really a lot of the New Testament too, is that deal that God made with Moses. All the deals count, the one God made with Noah and Abraham and Adam and David, all of that's very, very important, but the ebb and flow that in and out the up and down the sine wave of the plot of the Old Testament, all hinges on this covenant with Moses, the one that is conditional. And that is exactly the one that Nehemiah is referencing right here. We have a covenant, you are great at keeping your end of the bargain. So there's not going to be any tone on the front end of this prayer of Nehemiah coming along and being like, well, you know, I knew that you were shrewd and clever and that sometimes you reap where you don't sow. And so I did this out of fear and here's some more excuses. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's nothing like that. He is on his face with humility, assuming this posture of complete submission to God, acknowledging all the problems in the equation are with me and with us. None of the problems in the equation are with you. All of the inconsistency in this relationship has been introduced by us. Everything you have done has been absolutely consistent and in keeping with the promise that you didn't even have to make to us in the first place, but you picked us and you singled us out and you gave us this offer of relationship and of great blessing. And there's a little bit of paraphrase here, but really, I don't think there's, I don't think there's much license that I'm taking at all. That is what this language would communicate. So Nehemiah is completely acknowledging that we're the problem. We have things to confess. I have things to confess. Please hear my prayer. Please be attentive. So he seems to even be acknowledging that God might not do that. Now I've been working on a video this week about Ezekiel chapters one through 10 and the crazy vision of angels that he has there, but the theology of that passage hugely over shadows, the just wild, almost biotechnical description of angels that we get there because it's the account of Ezekiel having the vision of God's presence, which is dwelt among his people in guiding them through the desert and the wilderness and exodus in the Ark of the Covenant in the dedication of the tabernacle, the temporary temple that was a tent in the Old Testament, the dedication of Solomon's temple, all of these places, there's a physical manifestation of the presence of God that shows up. But Ezekiel has a vision starting in chapter one and running up through, I think chapter 10 of Ezekiel, of the presence of the Lord coming up out of the temple in Jerusalem with time roughly corresponding with the Babylonian invasion, the predates, all the things we're looking at here by about 150 years. And that cloud of God's presence going out away from the temple, even toward Babylon, when they rededicated the temple, remember that cloud of the presence of the Lord, there's no record of it showing back up. There's a lot of ambiguity behind the text in all of this here about where exactly the presence of the Lord resides at this time. Are you hearing me? I hope you're hearing me. And in that regard, if you listened to the episode yesterday, I can very much relate to that from phases in my own life. Where is the presence of the Lord? I don't have clarity on it right now. Well, neither did Nehemiah. It's quite the predicament to be in. So I don't think it's just hollow words in verse six when he says, let your ear be attentive in your eyes. Be open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. And I especially don't think it's hollow because he goes on to say, I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house have committed against you. And we're going to think about what he means by that and why it's such a big deal that he's owning that and saying that next time around. This is a very good prayer. Like I said yesterday, I relate to it on so many levels, but clearly this is big enough material relationally. This is significant enough in terms even of the grand stakes of all the redemptive plan and all of history. The Nehemiah feels the way to that in the same way Ezra felt the weight of it a couple of chapters earlier and he's got the good sense to really think before he goes and engages God in this way. It feels nothing like a hallway conversation kind of flippant sort of thing. It feels like a very carefully crafted, thoughtful orientation of self first so that he could approach God while assuming the right posture. And I think that gives it a lot of kick, a lot of power and will unpack it more tomorrow. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
