And right now we are working on the book of Philemon but we haven't been working on it very long. This is just the beginning of the fourth episode in this new season on this little tiny book from the end of the Bible that's only 25 verses long called Philemon and it occurs to me as we start this fourth episode that I haven't actually read you any of Philemon yet. That's Bush league, this podcast has Bible in the name. I don't think I've read you a word of Bible in the first three days. Those are rookie numbers. Come on Whitman, this is embarrassing, that's my last name if you didn't know my last name is Whitman. Alright here we go. I'm going to read you Philemon 1-1-3 which is kind of the intro to the letter and which kind of gets us to what we're talking about in our setup here which goes thusly Paul a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy our brother to Philemon, that's the name of the book, our dear friend and fellow worker to Aphia our sister to Arcapus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Isn't that a lovely beginning? We're obviously not into the meat of the letter yet there but also dang there's a lot of questions raised just in that little introductory set of verses there. I mean pretend you got dropped in from space or heck just pretend you've never read any of the Bible stuff and you don't know when this is set or what's going on. There's a lot of questions here like who is Paul? Who is Christ Jesus? He seems important. Who's Timothy? Is it literally Paul's brother or is like a fake brother like we're just good friends brother? Who is Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker also? What are you working on? Who is Aphia our sister? Who is Arcapus and why are you calling him a fellow soldier? Are you fighting someone? And what is a church? What does it do? And apparently it meets in people's homes? How big an organization is this? How big were your homes back then? Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Well it seems like whatever it is it's a nice organization because I like grace and peace and you know God seems good. So there's a ton of stuff to wonder about here and we'll get to all of it but for me right now I'm fixated on the second and third word of this letter A prisoner. Paul, A prisoner of Christ Jesus. Prisoner. A lot of times prisoners are supposed to be in jail because they are bad or did something bad. I guess occasionally prisoners are the good guys. This Paul fellow kind of seems like he's the good guy. He's acting so far like he's on the side of things that are right but apparently he's a prisoner and if I'm to take that literally that raises a lot of questions maybe first and foremost being who put him in prison? Who operates the jail? Whose legal code did he violate that put him in this situation and that my friends is indeed the setup question that I've elected to start with on this season which is who are the people that made the jail and put him in jail? Well Rome. All of this is happening against the backdrop of probably the biggest most famous, this most influentialist empire in the history of history. I would argue that from the ancient world the three things that most affect your life on a daily basis today are number one Jesus of Nazareth the Bible and Christianity. Number two the Roman Empire number three Greek thought and philosophy natural science stuff like that. Rome is a huge deal with a very long history and yesterday we started with the deep background of that history. The ancient world is made up of a series of giant empires that hand the baton of control of culture and law and everything. One to the next Egypt is kind of always there but then you get the Hittites and you get the Assyrians and then you get the Babylonians and then you get the Persians and then you very briefly get Alexander the Great of Macedon. He's basically Greek and then you get the era of what fancy people called the Diadoki or the generals of Alexander who go and make all of their little Greekish empires the Hellenistic empires is what those get called all around the world but from around the time of the height of Assyrian power we're talking like the 700s BC way way way out west on the boot-shaped Italian peninsula right on the place where still you can go see the city of Rome. This little tribe of the Romans is starting to consolidate power. They defeat their enemies who live on neighboring hills and gradually they've got control of what might be like into a little county and then gradually they gain control of most of the Italian peninsula and then eventually they start to exert influence on the central and western Mediterranean and eventually they have kings and their kings have laws and they are somewhat powerful and in this era of kings Rome expands there's seven kings in particular that history remembers and probably romanticizes a bit you got to remember the era of the seven kings in Rome is a really long time ago so long ago that in a lot of Roman and Greek culture myth and histories you're still sort of intermingled back then but the Roman monarchy goes into collapse as the story goes when one king Tarkin is superbus and his punk kid who's spoiled in a rat does some really ratty stuff to particularly a noble well regarded woman in the community and the king doesn't really enforce the law because that's just my special little boy sometimes you know boys will just be boys he got a little bit carried away and the Romans are like no enough of this dumb crap you're fired we're done with kings and they depose the monarchy and they create for themselves the Roman Republic which has elements of Greek looking democracy it's not like you know everybody gets to vote no matter where you are in society it's a sort of representative democracy where the super elites have influence and kind of check each other but they create kind of like a bicameral legislature i mean that's a very American way to put it but they sort of end up with an upper house of elected officials and a lower house of elected officials they put together a table of laws called the 12 tables a lot of the laws if you live in the west like western civilization the west a lot of those laws you would recognize in your own constitution the founding laws of your country wherever you live even a lot of the latin terminology from these very ancient laws you probably still use in your country certainly that is the case in my country the united states well by the time you get into the 200s bc a couple hundred years before jesus Rome is really powerful and they've got a rival power it's a people group who used to live north of the jews north of the old kingdom of israel in a realm that we call phoenicia and those phoenicians under all kinds of pressure i mean i mentioned all those empires who came and went you can see how somebody who lives right in the middle of it might get sick of it they migrated to modern day tinesia and created a place that in their language they called the new city but that we call Carthage or cartage and Carthage was the rival people group of Rome Carthage famously produced the great general hannibal who was a rival with Rome but eventually the sheer force and magnitude and size of Rome wins out and they defeat their rivals the Carthaginians in a series of wars called the punic wars and then it's on once Rome has solidified its hold on the western part of the known world they start looking east as they go into expansion mode in the two centuries leading up to the birth of christ their republic you know it struggles a little bit certain people come along and they treat the rules and the equivalent of the roman constitution they didn't really have one but the equivalent of that they treat that with a little bit of flexibility and as all of these very ancient roman norms of how you do governance and how you operate the military and how you tax and how long you can serve in office as all of these old norms become taxed the stability of the roman republic is shaken the roman republic phrase a little bit around the edges and as you get up into the hundred years before jesus the republic is kind of a joke it's kind of a republican name only it's starting to behave more like an empire with a lot of central authority like an oligarchy with a handful of very wealthy people making all of the decisions the military has just gone berserk under the leadership of great generals like Julius Caesar the roman military is expanding like crazy up as far as scotland what are they even doing up there as far out as spain and what we now call portugal why are you over there they're all over north africa rome basically owns egypt rome is clear up pushing through germany and toward the part of the world that we would associate with russian culture and around the time of the ascendancy of julia cesare in the mid first century bc about sixty ish years before jesus is born a roman general named pompe or some people say pompe gets invited by the jewish ruling family they've got a little miniature kingdom going on called the hasmonian kingdom or the hasmonian dynasty but it's a mass it's corrupt they can't keep it together so they invite rome to please come in would you please send us your general pompey to fix all of our problems over here and so pompey or pompey is like yeah i'll come fix it for the low low price of we own you now and so he comes and he basically takes over and rome never really gives israel back to israel from there on out and it's about this same time that julia cesare is asserting his authority over everything there's a bit of a roman civil war that goes on cesare comes out looking pretty good there he forgives his enemies he rules for a while but then everything in the roman republic is destabilized when on the ides of march 44 b c julia cesare gets shanked to death by a bunch of his legislative buddies in plain view of everybody and now that cesare is dead people have to pick sides are you going to join with team assassin or are you going to join with team we were friends of cesare and we will defend his name and now roman roman politics really turns chaotic it is a political earthquake and those aftershocks and those fissures are going to run through the entire ancient world including the world that we have in view this fight from about a hundred years before the time the letter of philemon was written absolutely i mean massively shapes the world in which this book of the bible the letter to philemon was written even though roman does not get mentioned technically in this little letter it does get mentioned all over the new testament and even unacknowledged it is a major player in this pickle this conundrum this unsolvable situation this kobiyashi maru that paul is trying to solve in his letter to philemon and tomorrow or the next day we should be able to wrap up our little crash course on roman history and then we'll get into trying to answer some of the other questions that these initial three verses of philemon raise all right that's good for now i'm matt this is the ten minute bible
