This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast and wherever you are right now, I just want you to start shrieking out as many of the Bill of Rights as you can think of from the their amendments to the United States Constitution. All right, ready? Go. Just start yelling them. Like if you're yelling right now, you're exercising one of them. This is fun. There you got some other stuff about you got the right to bear arms. She'll not be infringed. That one's in there. You got the fourth amendment. Maybe you're yelling that one right now. That's one that says people can't just rifle through stuff. The government can't just go through all your stuff or say monitor all of your electronic communication at your own tax expense. Yeah, I got feelings about that. The fourth amendment, that one was a good idea. Wish we did it more. Maybe some of you are like, no, I don't have to say whether or not I know all of the Bill of Rights or which ones I do know or don't know because it might or might not make me look bad. Therefore, I take the fifth. That's the fifth amendment. Remember that one about how you don't have to testify against yourself? I remember that one because I learned it in fifth grade and it's the fifth and that was fifth. So it kind of stuck with me. I remember thinking back then, that's genius. Now, it seems like there'd be a lot of ways to work somebody into a corner with words in front of people to bind them up and make them say something even out of context that makes them appear guilty. And then you could reframe the whole case to make it so that whatever they said to the questions you asked a little bit ago, now make them look guilty and lighted that new framing. I just made it sound like that occurred to me. I don't think it occurred to me. I think my fifth grade teacher who's a wonderful man to make a genius Ralph Ravenschlaug explained that to me. I think more what happened was then I was like, dang Ralph, that's a great point and I'm going to internalize that. The fifth amendment was not something that existed in the ancient Near East as best as I can tell. There was no analog to that that existed in the weird hybrid judicial system of the Roman occupation coupled with the leftovers of the Persian allowed theocracy mingled also with the Hasmonean short-lived kingdom dynasty that existed prior to the Romans. It was a strange time legally and there are a lot of legal elements from back in those days that carry over to now. But I don't remember anything about the whole remain silent thing. I think that could be used against you in a court of law if you remain silent back in the day. It strikes me as being culturally not normative that Jesus is on trial here in Matthew 26 and he's like, yeah, I'm just going to go fifth amendment until you make me talk. Here's what happens. He gets arrested. They take him under the cover of night to the house of Caiaphas. We're not even going to have this trial in a normal place. We're going to have it in a super secret place. Then they trot in a bunch of fake witnesses who's like, yeah, they're not really that good. So none of that sticks. But finally something comes up and it's about the temple. Two people come forward and they declare this fellow said, I'm able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days as we looked at yesterday. We don't have any record of Jesus actually ever having said that. But the best lies run parallel to the truth. And that one sticks and the high priest Caiaphas, who was appointed by a Roman governor, is outraged at this breach of protocol at this blasphemous statement. He's not interested in knowing what it means. If Jesus did say that, I mean, it seems like that's a crazy statement for one guy to say that when he doesn't have any swords or clubs or anything. And he's saying it or he's purported to have said it by witnesses in front of a room full of people who just used swords and clubs and things. Like you would think that the curious person as opposed to the judgmental person would be like, what did you mean by that? Because surely you didn't mean physically destroy it because you have no army and you have no money and you're homeless and you're just one guy. So like, what did you have in mind there? If indeed you did say that, that would have been a good follow-up question. But instead in verse 62, 62, are you kidding me? There are so many verses in Matthew 26. Instead, it says, then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you? Oh, he's all right. All right, Matt, dial it back a notch here. Maybe in the friendliest reading of that, you could imagine that Caiaphas was curious. And he just wanted to know what did you mean, but based on all of his behavior, based on when and where this trial is taking place based on all the traps that have been set before, I think it's more faithful to what we've seen contextually read to suggest that it is like I was throwing out a minute ago. This is not a curious question. This is an attempt to get Jesus to say more stuff and back himself even more into a corner. They clearly want him dead. That's been evident for some time. Look at the way he just got arrested. It looks like what they're hoping to achieve here is to get him to say something in this formal trial environment that isn't just two witnesses saying it about him, but to get him to say something that they can be like there by his own words, he is condemned. He said it. I think that is at the heart of Caiaphas's question here. Perhaps I am being biased because of my favoritism toward Jesus of Nazareth, who I believe to be the Messiah and the Son of God and the Savior of all humankind. I like him more than I like Caiaphas. You can now take that into account as you evaluate my remarks. And so he says, you're not going to answer. What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you, but Jesus remained silent. Now he did not say I take the fifth because there wasn't the fifth. Well, in the case, he just didn't say anything about what he wasn't going to say. He just didn't say anything. Jesus remained silent, which reminds me a whole lot of this other part of the Bible that I have marked with a candied cigarette, Mr. Best of Bookmark in the world, because you can eat it. It tastes good. And it doesn't have nicotine in it. And Isaiah 53 7 says, he was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter and is a sheep before her shears is silent. So he did not open his mouth. So there we go. It looks like just, you know, I want to realize that maybe 10 sentences ago, Jesus is saying twice that all of this stuff has to happen this exact way for the scriptures to be fulfilled. Verse 56. And again, he says, but this all has taken place at the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. We went and read the writings of many of those prophets. Matthew has clearly demonstrated a pattern of wanting us to see that this is how Jesus operates. Jesus is the fulfillment, the completion of the law and the prophets of the story, the predictions, the civil law, the ceremonial law, the sacrificial system, he's the completion of the characters of the Old Testament, even the ones from whom he is descended in his lineage. He's the new David, the new Moses, the completion of Abraham. He is everything. He's the fulfillment and completion of all this stuff. So this fulfillment motif is all over Matthew. And of course, this is a very intentional thing because Matthew wanted to point out that no, he was silent. That fulfills the scripture, because surely people had heard, no, like he talked, he testified, he said something in that trial. And indeed, he does, but not until he is charged under the law, under oath, to speak to the thing. Now, to the person who isn't his fond of Jesus is maybe I am or biased in that direction to the person who's maybe a little more skeptical of the origins of the Bible. They might look at that and go, that fulfillment is not as compelling as some of the other fulfillments because he does talk like right after that. And that skeptical person or critic, I would say you have got a pretty good point there. I do not think this is quite as compelling as all of the other stuff, but taken in the context of all of the other stuff is just another drop in the bucket of this fulfillment thing. So we go on, then the high priest said to him, I charge you under oath by the living God. Tell us if you are the Christ, the son of God. Now that's really interesting right there because Jesus had some stuff to say about oaths. Remember all of that back in Matthew five, and it's okay. Prayer, adultery, divorce, reckons murder, adultery. There it is. Again, you've heard that it was said to the people long ago, don't break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord. But I tell you, do not swear at all either by heaven for it's God's throne or by the earth for its footstool or by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great king. And I jump back here real quick for two reasons. One, because they're trying to use the pressure of an oath to make Jesus do things and he did have thoughts on that. But two, look at the stuff that Jesus said about oaths. Did we catch all this on the first pass? I'm not sure we did. Saying all of this stuff about don't swear at all either by heaven for it's God's throne or by the earth for it is his footstool. Let me go over here and you think about the exchange that wraps up at the end of Matthew 22, where Jesus has passed all the tests. He outmaneuvers the super ultra teacher of the law and answers correctly on that question about the greatest command. And then Jesus, he goes back over to the Pharisees. Remember this right before he tells them all off in chapter 23. And he reasons with them from that exact same passage from Psalm 110 that he's alluding to here in the Sermon on the Mount with his comments about oath. Remember, he comes back over to them and he's like, Hey, what do you think about the Christ? Who's son is he? And they're like the son of David and he says to them, how is it then that David speaking by the spirit calls him Lord for he says, and now he quotes from Psalm 110. Then this is the excerpt from the original language says, the Lord says to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. And then Jesus rounds out his argument about Messiah and David and who Sonny is and all of that business. The point is, the high priest comes to Jesus is like, no more taking the fifth. You got to speak to this thing right now. I charge you under oath to do it and to the attentive reader that conjures Jesus thoughts on oaths and Jesus thoughts on oaths conjures Jesus understanding of the hierarchy of reality. God owns everything. The kingdom kingdom, the kingdom system, that's the real thing. The earth is a footstool for that king below the kingdom system. And Jerusalem is supposed to be the city of God, but here it's being bastardized and weaponized to kill God's own son who is there. So now Jesus is charged under oath and he actually is going to say something and we'll look at what he had to say next time around. Hey, you know that album that Jeff made that I've been teasing that we've played a few bits of music from and that I helped out with the teeny-tiny is a little bit. Yeah, that's here. That's available. It's on Spotify. It's out there. You should go and listen to it. And you should put it on repeat and listen to it a whole bunch here in the first couple of days, even in the background quietly, to help Jeff with the algorithmic presence, that sort of gimmicky thing actually gets it done. But go give it a listen, please share it with people. The album is called the clamor and the crash. We're really proud of it, especially Jeff, because Jeff's the one who's good at these things and did all of the work. I'm so excited to hear your feedback on it. I'm going to play another little snippet from that album on the way out the door right here. And we're going to be talking about that a bit more at the end of things as we wrap up over the next few days as well. Thanks for listening to the music. Thanks for talking about the Bible with me.
