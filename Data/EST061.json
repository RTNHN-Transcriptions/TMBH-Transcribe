And right now, we're going through Esther. Have you noticed how through two chapters, well, almost two chapters of the Book of Esther, the main heroine, the main character of the book, the person for whom the book eventually ended up being named? Have you noticed that she hasn't made any decisions yet? Everything through halfway through chapter two that we know about Esther or that has happened in Esther's story, including the story of her ancestors has all just happened to her. We don't get to know how she feels about it, what she thinks about it, what she was excited about, what she was afraid about, nothing. But it's going to pivot because we're moving from the part of the story where she gets positioned to the part of the story where no matter how constrained her little environment might have been, she's now got to take charge of where she is. She's got to take charge of her decisions and she's got to really get things done in that environment to succeed and to emerge from that class. You can see what I'm doing, right? This is that genre of storytelling where the hero gets thrust into a difficult situation. Maybe it's a prison they find themselves in. Maybe it's some sort of magical academy or high school type environment or the far eastern training dojo where they go. There's always a class. There's always a cadre, a group of people who you're with, your peers in these kind of environments. In this kind of storytelling, the individual usually doesn't have any choice about how they ended up there. Once they are there, it becomes clear to the viewer, the reader, that they are going to have to make a bunch of shrewd decisions in a relatively low stakes controlled, safe environment, roughly equivalent to high school in order to emerge from that. Now, in ancient storytelling, and I suppose it's the same still now, right? You got this thing like we saw in the story of Cyrus the Great, how the immutable characteristics of a great character, great hero or heroine, you can't suppress those things. Eventually, it's just going to come through and we learn things about what kind of great leader they will be later by what they do in these relatively safe, limited-choice settings they find themselves in early in life. We're about to get that kind of situation here with Esther. I think it's really easy to just blaze past it and forget the Hogwarts Jedi Academy moment in the development of Esther's character that we get here. That moment where she gets put in the harem, this is your world now, young lady, this is the moment where she starts to make decisions for herself when we start to learn things about her instead of just learning about things that have happened to her. So once again, there's a whole bunch of passive voice. Mordecai and the whole family, they were taken by Nebuchadnezzar. Nobody picked that. It just happened to them. And then this girl, she loses her parents. She didn't pick that. It just happened to her. She ends up with Mordecai. She didn't pick that. It happened to her. And then Esther 2 and verse, what are we at here? 8. When the Kings order and Edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Sousa. She didn't pick that. She was among those who got brought to the citadel of Sousa. Maybe she wanted to go. Maybe she didn't. According to the way the author builds the story, it's irrelevant. And she was put under the care of Hegiai, put under the care that's more passive voice. She didn't choose Hegiai. That's who she got. Esther also was taken to the Kings Palace. She didn't choose to go to the Kings Palace. Or even if she liked the idea, it happened to her. It looks like she's still not making decisions at this point and was entrusted to Hegiai who had charge of the harem. But really, this is all just backstory at this point. And now we get to see her in action. It's chapter one is backstory on one of the main characters, Xerxes. That bleeds into chapter two a little bit, then chapter two gives us backstory on Mordecai and now backstory on Esther. And all of this is kind of happening in a prologue. Maybe while the credits are still rolling a little bit, we're not really getting much in the way of lines from many of the characters on screen yet. But we can tell from the visual cues and the music cues and the lighting and everything that that girl, she's going to be the main human character here. And we know we're going to get to know her better. Well, now that starts to happen in verse nine when she starts making choices. The girl pleased him and won his favor. Immediately, he slowed page turn there, provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned her to seven maids selected from the Kings Palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem. Now, look, I have no idea how she pulled this off. And also, I kind of have no idea about the social graces and elegance of women. You know what? The ladies are just really good at reading other people a lot of the time. And the elegance and loveliness of a lady, young or old who has figured out how to navigate difficult waters socially, how to handle her business. It's something that is mysterious to me and something that I tip my hat to. I don't get how it works, but man, do I respect it. And so it would be really easy to look at this passage and be like, okay, well, if you go to Hogwarts, you're going to have to be really good at magic to excel there. If you go to a Jedi Academy, you have to be really good at the force and a lightsaber in order to excel there. So what do you have to be good at if you go to a harem? It would be really easy to use that kind of reasoning here. And I don't know. Maybe whatever you'd have to be really good at to be good at being in a harem and beat out your classmates and rise to the top of the class so that your successes and this lower level can translate into greater successes down the road when you're really in the big leagues. Maybe that's how you read it. But also, I mean, a harem isn't just about physical pleasure all the time in the ancient world. A harem or that collection of women. Yes, they were set apart and selected usually not through the most voluntary of means in the ancient world to provide pleasure to a powerful man, to a powerful king. We've got enough evidence and data on how these things work to know that not all of that was sensual in nature, that there was an element of companionship that may have been involved as well. And certainly the social arts and the social graces of just being a compelling and interesting and enchanting person would have been in play. But I don't know where Esther learned the social graces. I don't know where she learned how to express gratitude and ingratiate herself to people, whether it was from her mom and dad before they died, whether it was from Mordecai, whether it was just a God-given gift or something internal to her. But I think the balance of what we see in the Book of Esther is enough for us to say she was really good at that side of things. She did read people well. She was thoughtful about situations. She thinks on her feet better than anybody else in the story. She seems to know when it's time to say the difficult thing. And also when it's time to take a few extra words or few extra turns of a phrase to build somebody up or to offer a well timed or well placed encouragement or compliment. This is a sophisticated girl. And the same way you're supposed to know that Harry Potter and his friends are really good at magic anger, whatever they do over there. So you're supposed to look at this and be like, well, that has interesting tidings for her future because she got there as an outsider and immediately is handling her business relationally in this circle. Now, let's just step back from the harem thing and those connotations from it. And just picture the last time you were thrust into a difficult social situation with very serious constraints. What's the most difficult thing? Figuring out how to win friends and build alliances and carve out a place for yourself socially. And then once you've done that, what do you do with it? Do you use it to help other people or do you use it to secure your position? It's a challenging question. So I think it's okay to just say she was socially sophisticated and charming. She was likable and she becomes what I don't know if you say this anymore, but back in the day, like the sweetheart of the contest, the one that everybody seems to be kind of rooting for. We just watched a nice movie the other day. What was it called? Mrs. Harris goes to Paris and in that movie, oh, it's a lady's name. Leslie Mandill plays the main character. She goes and just charms socks off everybody in Paris and she becomes the sweetheart of the environment there, the situation there. And everybody's rooting for maybe some special exceptions get made for her. And that's exactly the same kind of thing that you're seeing here as Heggie Eye decides to provide her with beauty treatments and special food. Did everybody get that? Well, it looks like if I glance back here, yeah, everybody got that to some extent, but it looks like Heggie Eye is getting to a place where he's like, I want this girl to win. Maybe he knew that she'd be a good fit for Xerxes, check some of his darker impulses. She just had the right kind of spunk or energy or courage. I suppose you could say this is part of the theme of Providence that this guy recognized her talent and made the effort to help her out. But first, she endeared herself to him. And as a result, he goes even a step further and he assigns to her seven maids selected from the King's palace and he moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem. So we didn't give her just basic attendance. He went and got attendance who knew what Xerxes liked, what he thought was attractive, what he thought was interesting. All seven of these ladies have sets of ears and eyes and had been listening and observing how the King works and what had been going on. They could coach her up in great detail if they wanted her to win. This would be a magnificent advantage, but it's not a fluke that she earned it. The text is showing us that this heroine now that she finally is getting to the part of the story where she is making decisions, though admittedly, those decisions are occurring in an environment with very strict restraints and parameters. She's still flexing her muscles. But we still see she can handle her business and left to her own ends with no Mordecai around to look out for her. She's doing okay, but Mordecai is still in the picture. And there's one important detail about how she is to conduct herself in this harem and in this contest that we will talk about next time around. Hey, final thought. I'm sitting around here trying to catch up on email and stuff that I'm just way, way behind on. It's been kind of a stressful month. Not a bad month on scandalous or bad going on, I guess, because we had a repair that went wrong on the house and now we're trying to sort it out with people who did it. It's sort of a big deal. I'm whining. It's not the end. I mean, it's going to work out. It's not that big a deal. It's just the kind of thing that when I'm getting it, it takes your attention. You got to pay attention to it all the time. It's kind of consuming. So open it up the email and I'm just saying a bunch of really cool stuff that you sent me, the ideas and questions and encouragement. And I know that I am not always lightning fast to get back to everybody and I am behind right now. But as I'm starting to catch up on that, I just feel really encouraged. I'm grateful that we get to do this together and that some of you would take the time to say, Hey, means a lot. I appreciate it. That encouragement is well timed. Let's talk about more rest or stuff next time around. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast. Let's do this again.
