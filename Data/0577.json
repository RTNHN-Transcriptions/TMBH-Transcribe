Today is the second half of a two-parter where Matt is drawing to a conclusion the discussion of the phrase the abomination that causes desolation from Matthew chapter 24. So here's some music and then we'll jump right in. Clearly, there had been a profaning of the temple and something to sure sounds like an abomination that causes desolation in the distant past under Nebuchadnezzar repeated under Belchazar and surely what we read about in the intertestamental books, second Maccabees and material like that. And what we read about from the extra biblical material about what happened under Antioch as epiphanies and under the age of Greek rule. I mean, come on. If that's not an abomination of the temple, what is? But then also the Bible doesn't speak to Pompeii's conquest of Jerusalem in the middle of the first century BC that brought Judea under control of the Romans, but Pompeii apparently waltzed right into the holy of holies as well. Is that an abomination that causes desolation? They I don't know. I kind of think so. I mean, heck, the temple and the temple grounds are the place where so much of went into crucifying the Son of God who lives in the temple occurred. Is that an abomination that causes desolation? For crying out loud, they killed Jesus. You have to consider the possibility that maybe even that is in some way what's in view here. But you also can't dismiss the reality that Jesus is talking about the physical destruction of the temple. We know exactly when that happened, 70 AD and Luke and his twin volumes, Luke and Acts seem so very interested in the vindication of Jesus as being wrongly convicted. The law was incorrect in its judgment of him. The government was wrong. The people were wrong that it's just hints so much more strongly toward the vindication that happens when people take into consideration what happened in 70 AD. So I don't think you can divorce this passage from that either. Surely, this was a saying of Jesus that rightly came to mind for people as they watched the Roman legions around Jerusalem and other locations where the final holdouts were hanging on. But then also, you can't deny the fact that there's more language throughout the New Testament that points in somewhat vague terms to a future even beyond 70 AD. That's not the end of history. I mean, I hope not if it is. What the heck are we doing now? Why are we still here? Other stuff has happened since then. And the stuff that we see Jesus talking about later in Matthew 24 at that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They'll see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. I don't think that happened yet. If it did, it's weird that nobody mentioned it to me. It seems like that's going to be the sign that's really obvious. And it's like, all right, guys, when you really want to know for sure, you'll know because I'll show up and you'll be like, oh, we know him. Jesus, our king and everything came back to life. Yeah, and we know that guy. So yet again, then we come back to the question of what does let the reader understand mean? Okay, let me take a crack at this. One, I think it means all that stuff I just said. It has to be looking backwards. It has to be looking at the immediate moment and it has to be looking forward just as the theme of the profaning of the temple looked backwards. It looked in the moment and it looked forward in the book of Daniel. So the same thing must be true here. Somehow it's all in view and somehow it is evocative of the theme of God's judgment and the sin of planet earth. And also somehow it is evocative of God's mercy in providing a warning or a heads up to people who are paying attention so they can get out of the way of this very difficult moment of judgment and sinful wrongdoing that's going to unfold. So it's got to mean all of that. But also I think let the reader understand might have some more subtle meanings. It is worth considering whether what we're getting here might be some kind of nod to say, you've got this. This is understandable and knowable. Look at the times these themes come up. They're going to come up more. Think about the implications of that and the grand narrative of history and you'll have a little clearer sense of how things are unfolding. It's possible that's what let the reader understand means. Just pause here. Reflect on this deeply. Let it it'll inform how you move forward. It's also possible that what we're getting here is something that would be a part of Jewish lore and history that the occupying Romans knew about as well. And this could sound like revolutionary language. And so maybe Matthew is including this editorial note the way he does as a way to say like, Hey, if this falls into Roman hands, like I can't get any further into this. I'm not proposing some kind of armed revolution or something. But you guys get what I'm saying. And so as unsatisfying as this is, we might have to acknowledge that there are certain parts of the Bible that though we can get the gist and what God would want us as a modern reader to know, we can't get it with all of the same cultural precision and full fleshed out context that the immediate audience would have been able to bring to bear on the words of Jesus. And at least in this situation, I for one find that to be a bit liberating. It lifts the pressure off of me of being like, Oh, you know, we get together and we do this thing. I just need to solve the thing for you. Because clearly there's a formula here and this can all be figured out and resolved. I'm not sure it's that simple. I think what is simple is that the disciples asked how this whole thing was going to work out. And Jesus said there's going to be a whole lot of history that happens. History is going to history. It's going to be ugly at times. So you know this idea of like throughout all of our story together, whenever the temple gets profaned, it's like a judgment. There's a thing that there's a larger dynamic than just politics happening there. You've seen what the profaning of the temple has done to shake things loose in the past. There's more of that coming and be alert for that implicit in that would be the notion that everybody remembers that, Oh, you profane the temple. It might seem like you're getting away with it, but God will not be mocked. Something is going to shake loose there. There's a judgment. There's a reckoning that comes with that kind of attempt to trump God to mock God. And what I also think is clear is that Jesus is again, intentionally avoiding giving the neat tidy answer to the question with a neat tidy timeline with dates and charts and facts and figures. Instead, what he's giving them is what they need to know, which is some stuff is going to happen. Here are a couple of more specific hints as to what that stuff will look like as it unfolds, but your call, my disciples, my followers is to faithfulness is to kingdom agency through all of this thick and thin and the unfolding of history. Your call is to faithfulness, even if this seems like it is a long time for you, it is not a long time for God. And with that, I think we're well positioned to move into the next part of this all of that discourse and see if what we get from Jesus next lends even a little more clarity to what we've already covered here in Matthew 24. Last thought and it's a repetition. I know some of you have been around the Bible for a long time and you get the dance steps of the parts where we get into prophecy and you understand that these things make sense in hindsight, but they're not designed to make perfect sense looking ahead, just to give us a sense and a call to action. That's how the Bible generally uses prophecy. That's very much what we're getting here. So if this is your first time being around stuff like this, I repeat, please don't be discouraged by it. This is in keeping with the genre. This is in keeping with the style of writing that we see all throughout the Bible and the alternative. Frankly, I think would be calamitous and weird anyway. If you're going to speak to what's coming in the future, this is kind of the way that you have available to do it without making an impossible situation for how things all unfold moving forward. This is meant to be understood a little bit now and in clarity and totality looking backwards later on. Hopefully that takes the pressure down a notch for you as well. Thanks so much for working through this stuff with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
