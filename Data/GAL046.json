But I liked them. It wasn't something that I looked forward to every year necessarily, but by the time I got there and got through that first day and they made us do stupid, embarrassing things, or play games, they got the inhibitions down a little bit. All of a sudden I'd be like, oh, this is pretty great. This is pretty fun. You make friends, even some lifelong friends in that kind of environment. My wife and I, when we were just very cautiously starting to date in college, we worked at camp together our first summer. And then we got married at that camp. And it was rad. So I liked camp, even if some of the things about camp, real cheesy, a little bit silly, and probably deserved to be needled a bit. I like it because looking back, I can see that people who are older than me were trying to invest in all of us as best as they could in that moment in time to try to impart to us something they had found to be very meaningful in their lives and to try to introduce us to the truest, realist thing. So there's my little camp spiel. Camp's funny, camp's goofy, camp's weird, camp's campy. That's probably why you have the word campy, but also it's meaningful. It's fun. Okay, now you know what I think about it. Bear that in mind while I tell you this story. One year at camp, somebody thought it'd be a good idea to have a little confession fast. So they lit up a bonfire. So everybody would get all weepy-eyed and stuff. And they did it with all the guys and girls. I think there was a high school when this happened. Now we're out there and it's, I mean, the whole thing is just harmonally supercharged to the moon. But also there's a great speaker and great music and sincerely meaningful spiritual things were happening too. But they decided, you know, confession is important. We're going to confess. So they gave us some parameters at the beginning. They're like, all right, no sexy stuff. We don't want any of that here. It's boys and girls and confess that to your counselor or whatever, not here. Here but you know, other stuff here, you can confess like, you know, what you're going through at home or things like that, you know, stuff you struggle with, doubt, whatever, you know, it's all fair game except for that other stuff. No talking about that stuff. And I go, okay. So people start talking and it's pretty good. People are chiming in really sincere heart stuff. And you don't always hear that from other people and look across the campfire and somebody's talking about something that's going on at home or a question they have about faith and God that makes it kind of hard to believe or know what to do next. And you go, ah, dang, you're a human. Ah, maybe everybody's a human and it really has a tremendous softening effect. But eventually the mood flipped and a few people started to figure out that there was massive social currency to be gained by saying really terrible things about yourself and then competitive instincts kicked in or maybe just hormones and maybe people figured out like, ah, yes, my drive to find a mate and reproduce is telling me that the way to do this right now is to be deeply pathetic. I'm going to be the most pathetic. And so people really hit the gas on that. And there was one kid that just killed me. His missionary kid, his parents were awesome. He's doing his best, but he did not get it. And he read the room, the worst of everybody. And he just started saying stuff and more stuff and more stuff and more stuff. I mean, he got cut off. The whole evening got shut down because of the things that he said. It was like, you know, self loathing kind of stuff way beyond the pale before it's like, okay, all right. All right. Oh, this has been very fruitful. Let's continue this conversation with our cabin leaders and maybe make a mental note to never ever ever do this activity again. Camp leaders, but afterwards the, you know, the camp counselor types pulled a few of us aside and they were like, Hey, you don't have to like just hate yourself. It's not the point of confession and they tried to kind of correct it a little bit in one of the verses that they cited. And all of that was this one right here. Romans 12 starting in verse three, for by the grace given me, I say to every one of you, do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you. And I'm looking back on that and thinking, you know what? That was pretty dang good camp counseling there. Sometimes when you hear this verse, it's just be humble. Like that's just a lot of words from Romans chapter 12, but the point is be humble, but you look at it a little more closely and is it really saying that? Like it's saying, yeah, I just don't think of yourself too highly, but also, you know, kind of like Aristotle suggested was a virtuous thing to do. Know thyself. Think of yourself with sober judgment. Have a decent read on what you actually are and where you're actually at. And don't try to trick people into something more, but also maybe don't do what that well intention kid did. Can't fire confession thing and just obliterate yourself and despise and loathe yourself publicly and dump your guts out in front of everybody either. The guy who wrote this particular verse that I think contains very level headed, sane spiritual counsel for anybody who wants it. The guy who wrote this is the apostle Paul. This is from again, the book of Romans. This is, it's one of the longer letters that Paul writes in the Bible is writing it to the Roman Christians. That's why it says Romans in the name. And in this particular passage, I think he's kind of not just telling other people what to do. I think he's also talking about an ideal that he holds to with this idea of having sober judgment, a reasonable view of who you are and where you're at and what's working and what's not, et cetera. And I bring this up because in the book of Galatians, Paul opens with the word apostle Paul and apostle. Last time around, we were talking about the weight of that word and how much it means. And Paul constantly is talking about himself and defending his own authority and apostleship, defending the reality of his conversion, defending the idea that he has a role with the other disciples or apostles, the ones who were with Jesus. And that what he's saying is like is from God, he's giving counsel that is binding. He views himself as called by Christ to provide leadership to these fledgling churches, well, to go and start these churches, but also to provide leadership. But as he's writing this letter, there's this big question, this elephant in the room that just is, well, should we even listen to him? Like how binding is this letter what to make of it? And as we've discussed for the last few days, Paul is going out of his way in the first few sentences to be like, no, you should definitely listen to it. This is very binding. This is very real. This is very authoritative. And as I've mentioned as well, this theme comes up a lot. Paul's apostleship. And he seems to have had a really good sense of where he fit into all of this. He talks about it a lot over in first Corinthians. I got all of these written down from time to time. It just seems important to me to tell you that some of this stuff, and no one off the top of my head because I read this book a lot and some of it sticks, but it's big book. I don't remember all of it. And a lot of times I forget where things are. And so sometimes when we're going to look a bunch of Bible verses like that, like we're doing right now, I'll just get a sheet of paper and I'll write down some that I remember. I'll look up a couple that I didn't remember for sure, but I kind of remember the gist of. So I just never want to give you the impression when we're flying around here that, well, if you read the Bible a lot and you take this seriously, you should be able to just know where everything is automatically. I mean, it's nice to aspire to, but I don't know. It's a big book and it's hard to remember where it all is. Everybody's looking things up. So here's something I looked up. First Corinthians 15 verse seven, this is Paul writing to the church in Corinth. It says, then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles that he hears Jesus. And last of all, he appeared to me also as to one abnormally born. And that interesting that Paul views himself as an apostle enough to use it as word number three in the book of Galatians, but also he gets it's a little weird. He gets that he hasn't followed the normal route to apostleship of the people who you guys are used to here and walked around with Jesus. So the post resurrection appearances of Jesus, this is who it happened with these were all commissioning and I was last, but I was one of them. So he acknowledges that his route to apostleship was a little bit unusual, but it's still a calling. It's still legitimate and God still called him for this role back earlier on here in the book of Romans, he says, Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God called to be an apostle by Christ Jesus. That is his assertion. That is what the church understood him to be back over here in first Corinthians nine and verse one, he talks about it a little more. He says, am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? Even though I may not be an apostle to others, really I'm an apostle to you for you're the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. The case he's making there is I saw the Lord and if anybody wanted out that and there are people who do doubt that, well, they've got to contend with the fact that you the current the church even exists because you're kind of the validation. You're the seal of approval. You're the thing that proves that God supernaturally called me and ordained that I play this role of apostle and then back over in the book we're looking at Galatians itself and we'll talk about this more when you get there. He says, but when God who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased to reveal his son and me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't turn the page, consult any man nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus. We're going to talk about that whole timeline. I'm getting too far ahead of myself, but the point is even in the book of Galatians, he's acknowledging freely. Yep, sort of a weird route to apostleship, but also it happened in full view of the other apostles. I have the approval of the other apostles and the proof of the reality of this calling for those who are the most skeptical and do not accept the word of the other apostles and the other Christians. The proof is the proof of journey. Look at these churches. Do they exist? Well, where did they come from? Well, if I'm some false apostle who isn't teaching the true gospel, how come there are all these churches that have the true gospel that I was a part of planting? We're going to see down the roadaways in a future conversation, a future episode as we work ahead in this book that Paul was very candid about. I have problems. There's a thorn in my side. I have an issue that I can't resolve. He knows he's got limitations. He knows he is not flawless. If anything, he views his flaws as part of what God uses to make him effective. So why am I spending all this time on this today? Okay, it would be really easy for you and I from a distance looking in to see a few of the things that Paul says and be like, that's pretty arrogant. Like you're talking about yourself a lot. You seem to like yourself a lot. You seem to be really eager to play the resume card and be like, I'm this. I do this role. The churches I planted, like look at all of them. I suppose if we snipped it out of context, it could be taken that way. But when you really immerse Paul in the full context of the New Testament, you see a guy whose confidence is in Jesus, not even just from that one encounter on the road. I mean, obviously that one's a big deal too, but the stuff that he's seen, the stuff that he's encountered, his actual encounters with Jesus himself with the Holy Spirit himself, he can't shake that. But people who weren't on the road with him and people who hadn't seen all of that stuff at times, it benefited them to oppose Paul. And if they wanted to teach something different than what Paul was teaching or what Jesus taught, they had to kind of get through Paul. And the easiest, most vulnerable way to attack Paul was to be like, he's not even one of the real disciples. All of them are back East. We don't really see them or hear from them very much, but trust me, they totally agree with my position. Paul is the problem. He's not even real. He's just making all of this stuff up. He's more like Simon the sorcerer who he met on Cyprus than he is like Peter, James, or John. Those guys are legit. They probably agree with me. Don't write them a letter. Don't ask them, but they probably agree with me. Paul, he's just a fraud. Like Paul, he's trying to hijack Christianity and make it into a whole different religion, a whole different thing. So he feels really inclined or he feels like the best way to counter that argument is to point out that he is indeed legitimate. So we're going to get a lot as we go through Galatians about the legitimacy of Paul's calling, his apostleship and the message at the Galatian church received from him. And if we just know that going in and we take a little time to do what we just did here, then the whole thing makes more sense. And I think Paul also then comes off as a guy who was not excessively arrogant, was not excessively humble and just self-effacing in every way like the poor kid at the campfire. Either he is trying to do what he advised others to do in Romans chapter 12, which is view himself soberly and not think more highly of himself than he ought. He's trying to view himself accurately for what he is and for what God has made him. All right, next time around, we're going to actually move forward and take a little grounding Galatians. It's going to be fun. A mat. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
