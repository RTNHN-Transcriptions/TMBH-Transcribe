This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. We are working our way through the book of Esther and right now as often happens in the course of this podcast, we're in a little bit of a rabbit trail because we're in Esther chapter three and we're just getting to the juicy part with things heat up because you got a situation where King Xerxes who's a little bit goofy coming off of his defeat at the hands of the Greeks in 480 BC. Now here we are a few years later. He's gone through some personal crises of his own making. He's survived an assassination attempt thanks to the help of a Jewish guy named Mordecai who sits at the King's Gate and overheard some stuff and very recently as we start Esther chapter three. Xerxes has appointed an Aggagite guy who is possibly descended from an age old enemy of the Jews. If not, he's at least ideologically aligned with the age old enemies of the Jews and this guy, Heyman, just out of nowhere. He comes to power and gets appointed to a role that looks like it's above even the role of the seven families who helped Xerxes dad Darius steal the throne from the descendants of Cyrus a generation earlier. This Heyman guy, he's an upstart. He's a hot shot. He's a big deal. He's a real boy and he does not appreciate it. If anybody shows him any kind of disrespect or I would say withholds from him a certain kind of respect that he wants. Apparently there's some sort of imperial edict that says when Heyman goes by, you got to put your nose in the dirt. You got to bow down to him. Well one guy Mordecai. He ain't having it. He's not doing it. And eventually it catches up with him and he gets him in trouble. Heyman hears about it and he's like, okay, well, I'm going to show you. I won't just kill you Mordecai. I'm going to kill your entire people group, the Jews, and I'm going to use my proximity to the power of the king to pull it off. Just going to take a second to pat myself on the back because that was a pretty fast reset. And today I want to talk about the Christian ethics, the morality, the biblical thought surrounding what one ought to do, what Mordecai should have done in response to the situation. Because I have heard people go through the Bible and make a case that any time that you are required to bend the knee or bow down to any kind of human leader, you should not do that because it's idolatry, some sort of idolatry. I've heard other people who've read through the Bible and they're like, nope, God likes government and especially Romans 13 is a passage that comes to mind where it looks like God is saying that he puts all government in authority and so they are right and you should do what they say. Some people my point to Jesus saying, who's pictures on this coin? Well, is a Caesar's picture on there? Fine. What is due to Caesar? And so there really are two competing values that if you just look at a few little pockets of the Bible, you might come away with and I could imagine someone because of the ambiguity, the moral ambiguity with which the author of Esther writes, I could imagine somebody just having another idea from another part of the Bible quickly pop in their brain and being like, yeah, Mordecai was doing the right thing. Take that, Haman, bend the knee to no man, only bend the knee to God. I could imagine somebody else reading through this and be like, what are you doing? Mordecai clearly on your way into exile, the prophet Jeremiah in the famous Jeremiah 29 letter to the people says you're going to get taken. You're going to go into exile and you got to be good citizens there. You got to work for the benefit of the city and God establishes all authority and all government and Mordecai, you should have bent the knee to that thing and been a patriot and a good citizen and supported your country, which is Persia, instead of being anti-patriotic and showing disrespect to your country and metaphorically, your flag, you got everything wrong. Well, honestly, both of those things sound kind of good. I get how they could resonate with certain people, but I want to go to the granddaddy of all the passages that has to do with this topic. And that is Romans chapter 13. I know we're in the Old Testament and Romans is in the New Testament and it's a totally different social setting, but we're going to do it anyway just for a few minutes here. Romans 13, one through seven, it's one of the most controversial passages in the entire Bible and it's one that understandably gets a lot of airtime as Christians throughout the centuries have wrestled with kind of Mordecai's situation. What do you do when you feel like you live metaphorically in exile and you're not fit with these values or this kingdom, but you're still here and you still pay taxes and sometimes you agree with the government, sometimes you disagree, but also sometimes that disagreement is big time because the government does something really bad, but sometimes the government seems to do things that are noble and good. How does this relationship work? So the passage in question is written by Paul to the people of Rome in Rome, probably under the reign of the vile emperor Nero who put sticks up the backside of Christians, dipped them in pitch and used them to light his gardens while they were still alive. So this guy was not super friendly to Christians. I guess you could say during his reign. And so Paul writes this to people who are enduring or are about to endure stuff like that from their government. Here's how it goes. Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities for there is no authority except that which God has established, the authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. For he is God's servant to do you good, but if you do wrong be afraid for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He's God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrong doer. Therefore it is necessary to submit to the authorities not only because of possible punishment, but also because of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes for the authorities or God's servants who give their full time to governing, give everyone what you owe him. If you owe taxes, pay taxes, if revenue, then revenue of respect, then respect, if honor, then honor. Now, obviously this is being written 500 plus years after the events we're looking at in the beginning of the book of Esther, but it's not hard given the conversation you and I are having to just drop that right over the top of the book of Esther. I mean, like, wow, so if you owe someone respect, then give respect. And I think if we just grab phrases here and there, looking at this passage, we'd have to say Mordecai was wrong not to bow and scrape and bend the knee before Haman because the government had a rule that said you had to, so you have to. But let's just think about this passage I just read in Romans 13 in the context of the larger Bible, the New Testament, all of that stuff real quick, because I think there are some things that even though on the surface it looks like it's saying something, it can't possibly universally mean that. So for example, this can't possibly mean that since God established all authority, which I think it clearly must mean that God establishes all authority sovereign over everything, but this can't possibly mean that because God gave them authority to rule their right about everything and was Pilate's judgment right about Jesus? No. Was Harrod's judgment right to kill all the babies? I mean, it was that no. Pharaoh decided he was going to kill a bunch of babies. Was that right? No. Clearly that wasn't right. Haman's an authority. He decided he was going to kill all the Jews. Is that right? No. So just because a government is in authority, it doesn't make them automatically morally right. Second, this can't possibly mean that the government always does justice. Clearly, Paul here is describing an ideal that the government doesn't bear the sword for nothing and they use it to punish evil and to reward the righteous, but I don't see Mordecai getting any reward. Then I do see a whole bunch of evil stuff getting rewarded in Esther. Further, again, Jesus of Nazareth, pretty prominent character in the Bible and Christianity, he didn't do anything wrong and the government used the sword against him and executed him painfully in front of everybody in a shameful, embarrassing way. Paul would have been familiar with the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth. That would have come up in his studies as a Christian. So he was well aware of that when he wrote this particular passage, knowing that the government obviously often punishes the righteous and rewards the unjust. Further, I don't think this passage can possibly mean that you don't criticize the government. Jesus called Herod a fox. Well, Herod was appointed by God, dad, that authority. Then Jesus called him out as a scoundrel. If I understand correctly, he even used a feminine form of the noun of fox, meaning that his insult was much feistier than just calling him a fox. John the Baptist criticized the government. Moses criticized the government at the command of God. The prophets criticized the government's left and right at the command of God. It can't possibly mean don't criticize the government, but think about the letter that's being written here. It's from Paul to Rome. Rome already had ejected the Christians at least once at this point, along with the Jews. Things were really heating up with Nero. Nero eventually would take the author of the letter of Romans head with a sword. I mean, literally with a sword. The instrument that Paul says the government only uses to punish the bad and that very guy gets his head taken off in Rome under the reign of Nero with a sword. No, I think the reality here is that there's a little upside for the early church in challenging Rome. Rome beat Carthage. Rome beat Greece. Rome beat what was left over of the Persians and the Parthians at one point or another. Rome beat Egypt and more politically than militarily. Rome beat Gaul. Rome beat the Alamani. Rome beat Britain and the Celts. This little tiny fledgling upstart Christian movement. They don't even have swords. They're not even a military. They're not even government. You're not going to beat Rome. And so Paul's strategy seems to be to operate peacefully within the boundaries of the empire and even endure injustice because it's the shrewd move. This is written like somebody who knows this is going to be scrutinized by the government. And it's written like somebody who's trying to inceptionize for the king, for the emperor Nero, how good government ought to be. Almost as though to say, well, wink, wink, knowing Nero is right there listening in on all of this, but pretending not to know that he's hiding behind the wall, listening in. Well, the thing about Nero is he knows as any good king like him does that the sword should be used to punish evil and that government should be something that promotes truth and well-being as our current emperor well knows. You see what you're doing there. You're inceptionizing the idea for the powerful reader who might be eavesdropping in that, one, you have respect for his position, which Paul did, and that, two, you would have naturally only the expectation that the king, that the emperor would use that power for good things and for just. But there's even another wrinkle here in thinking about the relationship between Mordecai and Persia, thinking about the relationship between other characters and their governments throughout the Bible and Christians through the centuries relationship with the government. And that is at times, there's another question. Which government? What if you live in Nazi occupied Eastern France during the early years of World War II? Who should you submit to? Which governing authorities? As soon as the Nazis get there and they print out a map and they get a red marker out and they're like, this part of the country now belongs to us because it's a red marker. Does that mean that now that you just obligated? Because I mean, they bought a Sharpie and they drew a line on a map. So now they're the governing authority. Did they not become the governing authority until they root out every last bit of French resistance? And then when you're like, well, I'm pretty sure the French resistance isn't going to win. I guess I need to obey the Nazis now. Or is it not until they capture the capital, like it's a board game or something? Or what if you have two claimants? What if you live in Babylon when the Persians invade? Are you loyal to Babylon until they kill Belchaser? And then as soon as Belchaser is dead and you see his head on a stick, then you're like, now my noble altruistic loyalty is shifted to the Persians. Or like, do you still fight for a little while after that? The point is sometimes the lines of who is in charge is even ambiguous. What if a gang comes to town and effectively they run your city? Should the people of inner city Seattle have been loyal to Chaz when they set up a makeshift government and dumped a few bags of topsoil from Home Depot on a tarp and tried to farm? Is that your government now? Should you do what they say? You see what I'm getting at here. All of this stuff that we might glean from Romans 13 is still happening in an enormously complex context and to simply read it and say, well, this is Paul saying that you just can't disobey the government and they're always right. What's nonsensical? That doesn't square with the rest of the Bible. That can't possibly be what he means because Mary and Joseph disobeyed the government by not volunteering their baby to get executed when the king ordered that was to happen. I think that was a good thing. Peter disobeyed the government when he got miraculously freed from prison and left. You're not just allowed to leave prison because that would make prison a friendly suggestion more than a requirement. I don't think anybody would ever go to prison if it were a friendly suggestion. The Magi were ordered by the government to come back and sell out baby Jesus or toddler Jesus to Herod and they were like, no, I'm not going to do that. They're treated in the text as being right for resisting. But Peter is treated in the text as being wrong for resisting when they went to arrest Jesus. Each of these things require a shrewd, thoughtful, larger biblical perspective to think through what the right thing is to do in all of these different situations. Now, all the way back to what we've been talking about, Nestor, do we have that with Mordecai? No, I don't think we do. I don't think the author of Esther has given us enough details to provide moral clarity about what it is that Mordecai should or should not have done in this situation. I'm feisty. I like subversive things from time to time. I like checks on power. This way I'm wired and I'm wired that way because of how I read the Bible. Maybe I'm reading it wrong. But I got to admit my predisposition to liking a bit of feisty subversiveness toward stupid authority that does destructive, unjust things. So I'm going to read that and tend to like that Mordecai did a subversive thing. You might read it and say, I don't know. I've had different experiences with the state. Maybe place a little different weight on some of the different passages that deal with this in the Bible. I think Mordecai should have just done the shrewd simple thing and just bent the knee. Okay. Well, we probably both have good points as it pertains to that particular passage, but I think we can both agree that the Magi were right to disregard the orders of the king and disobey the government and go and do something different and not sell out baby Jesus. My point is this is not as simple as it is often made out to be. And it is incredibly easy using only biblical examples to punch holes very quickly in some of the lazier constructs that are born out of particularly Romans 13 regarding the relationship between the individual and the state. I guess my capstone takeaway from reading the New Testament again and again and again and again and reading through the larger context of Romans again and again would be this concept of shrewdness that Jesus is always emphasizing. And that same concept of shrewdness is on display famously in Jeremiah 29 when he says, be shrewd, you're getting taken. This has happened while you live in exile live in this way because it's shrewd and it's right. And that's what you need to be doing right now. I think Paul is saying it's not shrewd to go and fight Rome. We're going to get snuffed out. We're going to have to play a different game in the face of these particular circumstances. Even though Paul himself found himself at odds with authority several times by his own volition, Jesus says several parables that promote the idea of shrewdness indeed in the lesser commission, Matthew 10, 16, Jesus says, behold him sending you out like sheep among wolves, therefore be as shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves. That tension in and of itself, those marching orders from the king himself are going to require some pretty serious on the fly, principled, moral, ethical, biblical thought depending on the situation that you happen to face. So big picture, my best guess on the what can we surely take away from Romans 13 thing would be one, God definitely put all authority in power. Haman's in power because God wanted him there for his divine sovereign, providential purposes. Xerxes is in power because he wants Xerxes there. Esther though is also in power because he wants her there. Mordecai is in his modest position of power because he wants him there. Nero's in power because God wants Nero in power. Herod was in power because God wanted him in power. Pharaoh, all these kings, none of them are there by accident. God is unsurprised by anything. He's in charge of everything. Even if the point isn't a fun one in the short term, God does not seed his authority to kings just because they do some paperwork or some clever assassinating to obtain power. But further the scriptures also teach that God directs these kings as he sees fit and when he sees fit. It's not like he gives them power and then abdicates that to them and hopes it works out. God of the Bible is how that is being sovereign over absolutely everything even when his rationale or his plan is not immediately evident to the biblical authors or to you and I as readers or observers of history. But further when we look at something like Romans 13 or the whole biblical corpus of stuff that deals with the relationship between the Christian, the believer in God and the state and government, one thing I know we can take away is that kingdom values informed shrewdness toward the situations we find ourselves in is wise. We see some followers of God in the Bible assume a posture of great humility before the king, Nehemiah before Artaxerxes for example. And then God uses that. We see others say absolutely I'm not doing that thing. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego before Nebuchadnezzar's idolatrous statue to himself. Daniel refusing the edict not to pray to the one true God. In those cases it was shrewd and it was right for them to reject the authority of a human king, a human government. In other cases it was shrewd and it was right to simply bend the knee to that authority for the time being. The Bible does not give us a neat simple cut and dried. Always do this. Never do that kind of guide to interacting with this imitation, lesser version of authority than the one true kingdom when dealing with the world kingdom. The world kingdom is slippery. It's weird. It's dangerous. We will find ourselves in treacherous situations as we interact with it. And so the exhortation at minimum is surely to shrewdness and kingdom values, kingdom action, kingdom motivation and everything you do in your relationship as a Christian if you are one of those with other people and with the government. Did Mordecai get this right in his refusal to submit to Haman? I have no idea. Simply don't have enough data to say. As I mentioned earlier, some of us will resonate with what he did. Others might question what he did. But even though the author of Esther does not seem to give us a clear moral example here in the first few verses of Esther chapter three, what we can say for sure is that the author of Esther is painting enough of a picture for us to know that crossing this government and that official is a very dangerous thing that could come with some massive consequences. All right. That was a lot every now and then I just grievously violate our agreement for how long these are going to be. Sometimes I would split an episode like this in half, but this is one flow of thought. I wanted to get the whole thing in. It has certain implications. It's an unusual episode. Thank you for enduring with me on a little longer conversation than usual. And thank you for doing what really is just a very surfacy quick version of trying to tackle a huge question that comes up in the Bible and in the lives of people who are trying to follow God in the context of the world kingdom.
