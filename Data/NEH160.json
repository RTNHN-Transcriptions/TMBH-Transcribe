narrative turn of a phrase a little kind of plot summary thing for a chapter of your life that's just closing an episode that you went through and you're trying to make sense of it you're trying to be at peace with it you've been grappling with it you're kind of looking for that language that you can use when you talk to yourself or even others about that particular chapter and then maybe eventually you find the language you're like all right that's pretty much how i feel about that for example let's say you get to the end of a difficult time where you're very involved but you don't totally control the outcome of the situation and the whole thing's done you're not totally satisfied with how it went but you feel like you gave it your best shot you might say something like this well i think it did everything i could there see those kind of things do you have those i've got a bunch of those in my life i feel like in the end of nia mia here we're seeing a guy who is getting to that point and who is developing his language for how to make sense of the rebuild Jerusalem both the walls and the people chapter of his life he didn't totally control the outcome i mean he had probably more say in the outcome of this than pretty much anybody else in the world save maybe art as irkses himself he's clearly not at peace with everything about how it worked out and so as we get to the very end of the book of nia mia we can both figuratively and literally hear nia mia trying on language to make sense of what this was and i do think it's something to the effect of well i did my best and hopefully good things come out of it or well i conducted myself with integrity i made the best choices i possibly could it's beyond my control now that's kind of funny is just in your talking about it i'm running back through the chapters of my book that i keep mentally that i don't think anybody else has and i realize dang i've got a lot of these little chapter summaries that i lean into if you brought up this part of my life or that part of my life and they're like oh no i know what my chapter summary is of that my little blurb for that part that makes it all work for me and i think some of them make me look good especially when i'm younger a lot of those chapter blurbs are framed to try to make me look good i think the older i get the more the percentage of those chapter blurbs that i write for myself i think more and more those are more just trying to make sense of what happened what passed there and maybe there's a little more room for even honesty in the blurb maybe just a hint of honesty not too much settled out now about me being a multi-dimensional character who had positive but maybe even also negative contributions to a given chapter that's interesting i've never really gone down this road before i'm just doing it with you now but we got to talk about the end of niamaya that's the point okay business discipline come on Whitman we got this thing we got the end of niamaya here there's a little bit of squaring things up that still needs to be done it goes like this niamaya 1328 one of the sons of joeyada son of elia sheeb the high priest was son-in-law to sandballat the hora night and i drove him away from me even here at the end of all things we're seeing that these three purges that niamaya has put in place that being the provisions of the temple by throwing tabayas stuff out the reforms of the sabbath by going and threading the leh hands on the people who are violating it and then the reforms related to marriage by ganking out dude's hair and beating them and making them repeat the oath that they took earlier if he wants these three things to stick he knows that he also needs to fix whatever is wrong with the oversight of these things and ultimately the buck stops with the high priest and his family and niamaya's discovered that the high priest is not terribly competent or maybe not morally competent for the role it looks like maybe he wasn't in a position to depose elia sheeb the high priest instead it looks like he's trying to cut around the problem to make sure that it doesn't metastasize and spread and so he goes and looks at the family tree of elia sheeb and he's like okay well one of elia sheeb's grand sons is also related to one of the great enemies of us as a people and the enemies of the wall project and everything sandballot no we're not doing that we're not bringing sandballot into ownership of our people and our religious temple system by marriage no tabaya isn't going to get in using squatters rights and sandballot our other enemy here is not going to get in through some tricky backdoor marital inheritance thing where a few people die and with a heavy heart he'll have to assume leadership of the temple and the religious system or where he could have a puppet high priest where if sandballot can't get in through the gates he'll just sneak in metaphorically through the back door and control everything that's going on inside of newly fortified Jerusalem by using a puppet son-in-law to screw everything up what niamaya's doing here is he's trying to secure the ground he has retaken in the scurging of Jerusalem and these reforms these reforms of reforms that we're seeing here in niamaya chapter 13 does this make you tired it makes me a little tired if i'm him i would feel a little tired because i mean it's like whack-a-mole he's just chasing down the same stuff again and again i mean the tennis ball example boom boom boom the balls are coming faster than a person with two hands can pick up the balls and put them back in the cart he's trying to cut the problem off at the source i see what he's doing and now we come back to this language that i was talking about at the beginning of our conversation here this life chapter blurb if you will the niamaya seems to be workshopping throughout the whole book of niamaya it always starts with the word remember in this case it goes like this remember them oh my god because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the leviates now the majority of the remember statements in niamaya have been remember me i'm trying to get this thing right i tried so hard and i got so far but in the end is it really gonna matter i mean that's what the kind of stuff that he's grappling with but there's also some remember me language that is more judgmental in tones so the remember me language is gracious in tone you're so grace to me i'm trying you can see my heart got i'm trying even if it isn't all working i'm giving this everything i've got the remember them language is calling for judgment justice punish them for willfully wantonly and unrepentantly getting this stuff wrong verse 30 so i purified the priests and the leviates of everything foreign and assigned them duties each to his own task i also made provisions for contributions of wood at designated times and for the first fruits so there's a real clear pattern here in chapter 13 really in the last third of the book the pattern is this everybody makes a covenant to say they're going to do basically three categories of things niamaya leaves a whole bunch of people including the people in highest authority the people should be caretakers of those promises violate all three of those big categories of things then niamaya comes in and using his own hands and goon squad i assume he corrects physically what is going wrong with those violations then he puts better systems in place then he has basically an old testament exorcism he purifies the whole place physically purifies the whole setting and tries to put it back into this state of ritual purity so it's all reset and now maybe we can move forward again so one two three we see that same pattern cycling here and maybe you could even count this as a fourth pattern or maybe this is an overarching pattern to say okay we fix these three practical things now i'm going to fix the people in charge of the oversight of these things and i'm going to purify their office as well and you get to the end of all of that with only one sentence still remaining to us in niamaya well what can you say if you were niamaya what would be your chapter blurb here i mean really think about that if you were niamaya given everything you know given everything about the contents of the whole old testament what would be your chapter blurb for this chapter in your life i mean this is a pretty big deal you kind of marry yourself to this kind of language and so i'd want to take several more passes at it but my initial thought is back to what i said earlier well this situation was largely under my control but not totally under my control and i did my very best and i think i acted faithfully i don't think i was afraid of anyone i don't think i left fear dictate to me what i would and wouldn't do i simply tried to do the right thing without consideration of winning everybody's approval or being popular at every single turn but ultimately i'm not going to control the results down to my last day in that town i was doing my very best to do what i thought was right with my position to set this thing up for long-term success in the context of this grand story that we're a part of but now i'm old and my time leading this thing and being the caretaker of it is passing into shadow and somebody else is going to have to step up if they want to keep these reforms and i wouldn't be surprised if at least at some point that was niamaya's chapter blurb but his forward-facing language is outward-facing language the language that he uses with other people and immortalizes in this book focuses instead around the word remember and i've been teasing that for several days and tomorrow we're going to unpack those remember statements and read the final verse of niamaya together also final thought i'm really intrigued by this idea of how we i think all of us maybe maybe not you but i i think most people write chapter blurbs for these moments in their lives to make sense of things and i've only been thinking about this concept for whatever the 13 minutes that i've been recording here but i'm running through a bunch of those in my brain it's kind of a background process while we're chatting here i dang i have a lot of chapters and a lot of chapter blurbs maybe i need to revisit some of those maybe they're not as well written or as honest as i would like huh food for thought all right i'm matt this is a ten minute bible hour
