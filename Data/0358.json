This is the 10-minute Bible Hour podcast, and you are in the middle of a two-part conversation on Matthew chapter 15, and specifically the geography of the second half of Matthew chapter 15, which is a very important question because where this is happening really affects what this passage means and how the original audience would have understood it and how we understand the structure of Matthew. So we've been working through that historical question of where all of this business is going down regarding the following passage, Matthew 15, 29, and forward. Jesus left there. That's way up by Tyre and Sidon, north of Israel, and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountainside and sat down. Great crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others and laid them at His feet and He healed them. The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking. The crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel. And with that rattling around in our brains, let's get back to processing through where exactly all of this stuff went down and who exactly Jesus is talking to and performing miracles for as it is going down. Here's some beautiful music from Jeff. So even though these towns don't come up much in the gospels, you know, they're there and several of these places you can go and visit. And there are some ruins that you can walk along, colonnades, things like that. So we have a sense of how Greekish this all looked. And it was culturally very different than even archaeologically how things look in Israel. The styles were different. Clearly architecturally, you see a resistance to Hellenism in Galilee in particular, but also in Judea, whereas in the Decapolis, you see more of a leaning into this stuff. And the Decapolis would have been very proud of their independence. It's kind of like Deadwood, South Dakota. In the history, there is a bit complex and mired in broken treaties and mistrust with the Native Americans who lived in the area. But Deadwood, there's gold out there in whatever was the 1870s. And so people went to Deadwood and this is like your old West archetype. This is the town. And because it was completely lawless, except for the law that the citizens there upheld themselves, there was no outside government acting on it. And Deadwood was very proud of that. And Deadwood, even to this day, if you go there in the Black Hills, it still bears many of the marks of a place that thinks of itself as being different, as predating the larger government presence in the area of South Dakota and the United States. I think that these cities of the Decapolis would have held this value much more firmly. They had seen a whole lot of governments come and go and they had managed to broker independence with all of them, in part, benefited by their remote location. They had seen a whole lot of deities come and go, a whole lot of claimants to this messiah ship or that chosen one ship come and go. And they just watched them come and go and continue to do their own thing, which probably would have looked vaguely Canaanite-ish mingled with a ton of Hellenism and a healthy dash of Romanism. Now, at the point that Jesus is there in the first half of the first century AD, the Decapolis, I mean, these are 10 or 18 or whatever, very independent cities. This is not a league like what you got with the Athenians, Spartans way back in the day centuries earlier, clear over in Greece. These were just independent towns, seemed to do their own thing, manage their own affairs, have their own justice system, et cetera. It looks like at times there may have been some kind of small tribute paid to Rome, but they really were out on the frontier and Rome would have had a difficult time enforcing anything there anyways. All of this to say that if Mark is to be believed and combined with Matthew's account, we are able to recreate this travel that stems from an awful showdown with the elite religious leaders who come up from Jerusalem and want to pick a fight with Jesus about hand-washing and Jesus is like, okay, they're fine. And he goes way up north, crazy north to tire and side on. And if we can reestablish this route to have him coming back down and ending up on the east side of the Sea of Galilee in the Decapolis, then all the way back to the thing I was talking about with comedy and Bill Burr and all of that, then we've got our geography set and we realize we are talking about completely different people than the folks that we've been imagining Jesus talking to in every other part of the book of Matthew. It's been the home crowd in the book of Matthew, people who would know the Old Testament, people who would have a theological and political opinion about the Messiah, people who would have certain attitudes about Romans that would all fall within one given spectrum. And now we're outside of all of that. We're dealing with people who have a completely different set of considerations about the Romans because they're not occupied by the Romans. They would have had very different attitudes about God and the whole narrative of all of life and the body and sex and money and power and virtue. And so what we have going on here is not a conversation with an expectant crowd who just needs to be steered in their understanding of a shared religious cultural text and shared cultural history to understand that Jesus is the fulfillment and completion of everything their story has been about. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're in a completely different world now and that narrative and the stuff Jesus has been saying and doing, it's probably going to play a little bit different here because we're not San Francisco anymore. We're in York, Nebraska or vice versa. It's not really analogous, but I think you know what I mean. So we go back to this passage here in Matthew 15 starting in verse 29 bearing in mind that we are talking about Jesus interacting with a completely different group of people culturally, but also bearing in mind that Matthew is still writing to Jews who would have to conjure their opinions and assumptions about the people across the lake in the Decapolis and they're filling in gaps in their own brain about exactly who these people are and what they would be into and how they would anticipate they would respond. And we're playing some 4D chess here as we consider what Matthew is trying to accomplish by including this passage in a document written to the Jewish people. So let's just revisit the text and see how it strikes our ears now. Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Now I'm just going to insert a note from Mark chapter 7 in the corresponding passage in the region of the Decapolis. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. Great crowds came to him bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others and laid them at his feet and he healed them. The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing and they praised the God of Israel. Did you catch that last phrase? The God of Israel. And we don't really see that through the rest of Matthew. I don't think it's stuff like God or the language of Father, meaning some special relationship with the people Matthew is writing to and Jesus is interacting with. But here they use the language, the God of Israel. These are outsiders. That language wouldn't be present, Matthew wouldn't be saying that in addition to the fact that this is a repetition of all the miracles and signs we've already seen that confirm that Jesus is the Messiah in the style and sense predicted in Isaiah chapter 35. So you had all of that stuff up. It sure looks like we are somewhere else and Jesus is doing this stuff a second time for a completely new audience. Now that's going to play one way in Israel. It's going to break people out into three groups. Those who are really excited about it, those who are the squishy middle and those who already have a version of this religion and they don't really want that to be the Messiah and they don't like the way that looks. And so they angrily and violently reject him. Over here, you're going to get a different spectrum. This Jesus stuff is going to mesh with the cultural intellectual theological receptor sites of these people at different points and in a very different way. And I think that's what we're going to see play out. But what's really interesting here is that Jesus response is the same to them. Check this out. Jesus called his disciples to him and said, I have compassion for these people. They have already been with me three days and I have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry and they may collapse on the way. Wait a minute. Do you see what he's setting up to do here? He's setting up to feed another gigantic crowd of people who've been lingering around. Well, who was the last gigantic crowd of people he miraculously fed? They were all Jews. They were people who had followed him from West to East along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. They're the chosen people. They're the insiders or the inside baseball people, the people we've been talking to and about all along. Now he's going to do the exact same thing for outsiders. That's how it's shaping up and get this. How about this language? I have compassion for these people. What? That's the exact same kind of language that we just reviewed that he's used like three times when he sees the crowds. Remember, he looks at the crowds and they're harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd. I don't know why I'm turning so many pages. I know where it's at. It's the end of chapter nine and Jesus has compassion on those Jewish harassed and helpless people, those crowds. And he tells the disciples to pray that God would raise up people to do something about that. And then you move along a little further in Matthew chapter 11 at the end of it after another contentious thing. You get this stuff about come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest. It's more of that compassion language. In the middle of chapter 14, Jesus tries to get away after his cousin gets beheaded and the crowds follow him. And then it says, when Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, these are Jewish people, he had compassion on them and then he heals them and does miraculous stuff. And then he feeds them miraculously. He provides for them as is the kingly side of the oath of fealty that happens between a subject and a king. Look at what's happening here. It's a simple question of where is this going down? If it is indeed Gentile territory and I don't see how we can make a case that it's not, then what this means is Jesus is proclaiming by repetition of these actions that he is not just the provider for the Jewish chosen people. He's the provider for everybody that his offer of grace, his offer of kingship and the values of the kingdom and participation in the kingdom. And dare we even say, sonship and daughterhood that even that is being extended to these outsiders. It was unthinkable to most of the Jewish world at this point, but that's what he's doing. And that's what I think we're going to see as the payoff, the culminating event of Matthew's chapter 15 description of this road trip that lands Jesus in Gentile territory where he begins the process of establishing himself as the king there, just as he is the king over the Jewish people in Galilee and in Judea. This has massive implications. And look at us, we just spent two days on geography and history. I love that we do this from time to time. Then then I go and I look and I'm like, Oh, everybody's still there. That's cool. They must not hate the occasional geography and history in support of understanding the text. Good times. Hey, just as a heads up. They've sent out a large percentage of the field notes books to all of the patrons supporting at any level at patreon.com slash the T M B H podcast. Those are not all mailed out yet. Takes a surprisingly long time to get those all stuffed and put together. Those of you who have it already, you'll notice that I put some groovy little square, scannable share with your friends cards in there. I would be hugely honored if you would do that. You'll see that some of those have a little red YouTube logo on the front. If you scan the back, it takes you to the YouTube channel. The others say podcast on the front. If you scan the back of that, hey, it takes you to the podcast. You see what I'm doing there. The biggest honor that you can pay me is to think this is worthy of sharing with somebody who you want to impress and who you don't want to disappoint. I understand what a vouch means and what a big deal it is. And thanks to all of you who've taken the risk of passing this along to a friend. I appreciate you. Thanks for talking shop with me.
