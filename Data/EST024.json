If you're building a clubhouse in the backyard and some of the other neighbor kids come over and they're like, you're building a clubhouse? Well Gee Willikers, Mr. I've got a saw and I've got a hammer. We'd love to help you. And you were like, no, you have no part in the building of this clubhouse. And that'll hear you little rascals. We're going to make this thing ourselves and you will never enjoy the benefits of that. If that was the story in most circumstances, any fair onlooker would have to be like, why are you people being like that? Those kids showed up with their calyx and their rolled up pants and little dirt smeared on their face with their dad's tools and they wanted to pitch in and make a thing. And you just kicked them out. Like, total Jack Waggins, you're bad people. I hope lightning strikes your clubhouse and the whole thing burns down. Not while anybody's in there. I'd never wish that on any of these people. But as we discussed the other day, we've got a very weird social cultural situation, religious situation unfolding here in the book of Ezra. Chapter four gives us this weird scenario that at first glance seems like the Jews are being big time jerks. And when you look closer, only maybe are they being big time jerks. I suppose there's a couple different ways to read this. And if you want to know more about it, I covered this stuff in detail and what to make of it when I covered Ezra and Nehemiah in that last series we did. So you might want to go back and catch that there and maybe it'll be helpful. But this is what happened. Ezra four, one, when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin, okay, Judah and Benjamin are the two remaining tribes. Chapter seven, 22 BC, the northern kingdom of Israel, which includes 10 of the old school tribes of Israel. They get defeated by the Assyrians and the Assyrians weren't nearly as nice as the Babylonians. They obliterated those northern 10 tribes. They took them away. They intermarried them. They enslaved them. And some people say they can still somehow trace something back to these tribes. But I'm historically very skeptical of that. These tribes look like they are lost to history, which means that all that's left after 722 is the southern kingdom, which includes the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. So that's what we're talking about here. That is, these would be the two remaining tribes that got taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar and 586, as we've discussed so much. And these would be the two remaining tribes that would represent the Jewish people as they go back to rebuild things under the edict of Cyrus. So when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the Lord, the God of Israel, they came to the rubable and to the heads of the families and said, Gee willikers, mister, that paraphrases mine, let us help you build because like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esher had on King of Assyria who brought us here. And if it weren't for one key word in that description, we would need to jump to the conclusion that these people are just nice and their neighborhood kids who want to help build the treehouse and the Jewish people, if they don't accept them, they're being really exclusive jerks. But there is one key word there to keep in the back of your mind as we read ahead. And that is enemies when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building. So I just put up in in that. Let's move forward as we're four, three, but Zerubbabel. This is again, the direct descendant of David appears in the lineage of Jesus. He would be king if there were a king. So you got the right guy in charge. This is the one everybody's looking up to, but Zerubbabel, Yeshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, you have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the Lord, the God of Israel as king Cyrus, the king of Persia commanded us. A few points of emphasis there are mine, but those are all the words as they are actually written down. So what do we do with this? On the one hand, it is possible to look at this the way one might look at the exclusive clubhouse builders in my neighborhood example and be like, just let all the kids play together. Why are you being this way? And I suppose if you were coming from a place of complete ignorance about the history of this and all things being equal, that probably would be the fair read. If your mom or dad and you walk into the backyard and this is going on, you're like, Hey, guys, include everybody. Come on, quit being that way. But again, given this complex cultural moment, we pinch zoom in a little bit closer and we discover there might be some shenanigans going on here. I don't remember if it was yesterday, the day before, whenever we talked a little bit about some of the obvious jealousy that would be in place for those people left behind by Nebuchadnezzar and the dude in charge of taking all the Jews into captivity. I don't remember his name now. They're at the end of Second Kings. We call them Ron. I'm going to keep going with Ron. I guess they decided to leave behind some of the poor families to be vine dressers and plowmen to just maintain the land for Babylon in case they ever want to do something later with us. You got these hill people who are still around and pretty clearly there would be resentment that after 50, 60, 70 years, all of a sudden here come the old Judah and Benjamin types back and they've got a little signed piece of paper with a wax seal on it from Cyrus and they're all uppity and proud of it and they've got a whole bunch of money and we don't really have money. Then maybe they've got two choices all of a sudden. Choice number one is be resentful and just try to bury them. But it looks like these people who remained, people who got left behind by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC, but also some of the hill people who were resettled there by Assyrian kings dating all the way back into the 600s and maybe even the 700s. They're still there as well. These would be forced transplants that might have some ethnic vestiges of a little bit of the 10 northern tribes maybe, but the water has been intentionally muddied by the now defunct Assyrian Empire. This is one of those things that once you do this, once you do some kind of an ethnic purge or pogrom or relocation thing in history, you can be sad that it happened. You just can't undo the damage. You can't really fix that. Reparations wouldn't have fixed it for these people resettled by the Assyrians. It wouldn't put the 10 tribes back together. People do horrible things to other people throughout history. Governments do horrible things to other people throughout history and citizens go along with it. Then you just have these hideous awful moments and we've got one of these here. Aren't these people victims who just want to join back in and help out? We're going to see pretty quickly who they really are when they're told no upfront. This isn't your thing. Remember a minute ago, I was mentioning you got really two options. Play number one if you are the hill people. The resettled people. Just go with it. There's a new overlord in town. His name is Cyrus and he has ordained this. We got to see if we can get on board with this gravy train and see if we can make this thing work. Option number two would be we're jealous and we're going to destroy the people who right now have a little bit of historical economic momentum and see if we can wreck what they have cooking. I struggle when I read Ezra Nehemiah because I just don't feel the historical tension with these outsider groups. It doesn't sting. I don't automatically understand why they're described as enemies. I can articulate them trying to do that, but I don't viscerally feel all of the fences and all of the slights and all of the background and all of the bad blood and history and toxicity there to be able to look at them like the text holds out. There's a rubable in Yeshua and the heads of the families as being able to do and just be like, oh my goodness, as he right through this ruse, you do not mean that. You are not here with your calyx and your bibbed overalls and your dad's tools and your dirt stained faces because you just want to help build the neighborhood clubhouse. You are here maliciously and with the intent to destroy and clutter and muddy this very special once in all of history opportunity that has been providentially afforded us by God. So the text holds it out as though the leaders of Benjamin and Judah, the Jewish people see this for what it is. And the text to me gives the impression that they made the right call and the right assessment. We'll talk a little bit more about why I get that impression when we get to the next little passage next time around. But still there is something very 21st century about me. There's something about me being raised around the words of Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. King was lionized in my household and the schools I went to growing up, both public school and Christian school. He was held out. It's like having the vision. This can work. We've got to come together. We got to evaluate people based on the content of their character and education changes lives and we got to move past petty external discrimination and breaking people up into tribes in this way. And he was speaking to 1960s post antebellum South Atlantic slave trade. He's speaking to a very different moment, but that vision went straight into my ears and into my heart. And I continue to think it's a beautiful vision for how we can move forward from the ugliness of history as a unified people who like each other. And since I'm here, I'm just going to say it. I don't believe in the visions for how to move forward with those questions that have come out since. I think they're racist and I think the dumb and I don't think they will achieve anything good for anyone in the long haul. But I continue to be very persuaded by the ideas and the teaching and the example of Dr. King. So as a person raised on those ideas, who still thinks they're good ideas, man, I look at stuff in Ezra and in the Old Testament in general where there's this Jewish exclusivity and I'm like, but let's try a melting pot because that's a good vision for how America should be. But it's not America that we're reading about in the Old Testament. We're reading about something completely different. We're reading about something that was a theocracy for a time with the Jewish people. And after it was a theocracy, it was a theocratic monarchy for a time. And then it turned into just a straight up ugly monarchy. Then the whole thing fell apart when it totally lost touch with the God who had put the whole thing together in the first place. It was a different deal. And where we were at in the redemptive plan was God was saying that he wanted to have a holy people group set apart for himself. And in his relationship with that people group set apart for himself. He would demonstrate his reality as being God, his power as being God, the reality of his law, of his justice, of his mercy, of his ethics. And the people group who he raised up out of just one random dude and his wife didn't hold up their end of the bargain. And one of the things they got most wrong thematically through the whole Old Testament is that they went and completely mingled with their neighbors. And maybe that would have been okay. It looks like God and the prophets knew from the beginning, there's no way that would happen. You knew that the Jewish people would abandon the law of God and embrace the law of these idols. He knew the Jewish people would literally take their babies and put them on the hands of a burning hot pagan God metal sculpture and burn their babies to death as a way to exalt pagan gods. He knew that this was going to be a one way or the other thing. And the relationship he wanted with these people was not one that was a little bit of God and a little bit of Moloch, a little bit of Daegon, a little bit of child sacrifice to go along with it. And every time his set apart people group that he raised up for his redemptive purposes went out and mingled with the ideas and the religion and the violence and the ugliness of the neighboring tribes, awful things happen. So what we're getting in Ezra, it looks like it's like a second chance, right? To be a people set apart for God. And so while I continue to be steeped in the values of Dr. King that I was raised around and while it is admittedly very hard for me to read portions of the Old Testament like this without thinking of our own moment in history and the challenges that we face, I still, if I work hard enough, can understand that this is a different time and that there are very different tensions and that can help me to understand what might be going on in a passage like this in Ezra 4. I think it's going to become more clear what's going on here when we just go to the very next passage. So perhaps I've lingered a little bit too long. Thank you in advance for your grace as I touch on one of the three or four topics that can be complete internet suicide for even mentioning. I very much mean well in what grace and peace for all people. Thanks for hanging out with me. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
