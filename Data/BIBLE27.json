Right now we're going through the entire Bible to understand it as one big, cohesive story. We're covering one book each day, and this one's about Daniel. I'm telling you, my friends, Daniel is so dang good, then it's a trap right there in the middle of the Bible, because let's say you're making a podcast and you're trying to have a bunch of conversations about the Bible and you got to do one every day. You don't have a ton of time to linger on each book and read it and read it again and read it again. But Daniel is so interesting and it has such big implications and the narrative is so good that it's really hard to hustle past it. Maybe I want to open here with a sales pitch for why I think it's so interesting and so cool. It defies categorization, it's half narrative and it's half prophecy and the two mingle together in interesting ways. The basically the first half is the narrative stuff and the second half is the prophecy stuff. As if that weren't enough, half of it's not written in Hebrew. The rest of everything we've looked at almost entirely is in Hebrew, but Daniel only has chapter one being in Hebrew and then chapters eight through 12 being in Hebrew. But in the middle, there's a giant chunk of Aramaic, which by the time we get to Jesus, that was the language that the Jews were speaking, walking around in those scenes in the New Testament. But back here, Aramaic hadn't totally caught on everywhere yet. In fact, it was during the life of Daniel that Aramaic went from being a language that saw some use because lots of different people could use it even fumblingly to communicate under the larger banner of the Babylonian Empire. But then when Persia comes along, Aramaic becomes a court language, an administrative language used throughout the entire Persian Empire. And so it makes sense that we would get a chunk in Aramaic, but still it's kind of jarring to suddenly encounter this big chunk of the Hebrew Bible that isn't in Hebrew in the book of Daniel. The third reason that Daniel is super, super interesting and compelling is that the prophecy is wildly big picture. It has similar visuals and imagery to Ezekiel. Maybe that's just a function of God drawing on imagery that would have made more sense in a Babylonian context. I have no idea those two books though. They definitely stand out just in terms of the visions they describe and what stuff looks like. But whereas Ezekiel's prophecies are focused on God's judgment on the nations right there and then in that moment of history, Daniel is talking about the ebb and flow and churn of history as one empire collides with another and is defeated and rises and falls and it looks far, far, forward into history. And that takes us into a whole new realm of conversation and reflection as pilgrims, as journeyers through the Old Testament together. More on that in just a minute. The book of Daniel opens a lot like Ezekiel opens where you've got a Jewish young man who finds himself in captivity in Babylon. But Daniel and Ezekiel did not get there quite the same way. Daniel was a part of the very, very, very, very first teeny, tiny little group of people from Judah to be taken away into captivity. This wasn't even really an exile. It was more of a hostage exchange where the Babylonians and Nebuchadnezzar get some hostages and the king of Judah gets no hostages. Judah at this point in the very, very late 600s had been kind of hiding behind the other superpower of the ancient world that being Egypt. And now at this point, Nebuchadnezzar, this happens in 2 Kings 24, the very beginning of 2 Kings 24. Nebuchadnezzar is like I've had enough of Egypt and so they go and they have a big fight and Nebuchadnezzar wins the battle of Karkamesh and then now that he's feeling it and Egypt has been brought to its knees. He's like, all right, Judah, no more messing around. You're going to owe me tribute and also I'm going to take a few of your young men back home with me just to ensure you're good behavior. Daniel, as well as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego of fiery furnace fame are some of those hostages. Well, it looks like they all get treated pretty well there and they live life well and they earn favor in the royal court. This in and of itself in a hostage exchange situation between an overlord and a subject kingdom would not be weird because the overlord would want to bring talented promising young men as hostages and would want to ingratiate themselves to these young men as a lever of control over the subject state back off on the far distant horizons of places. And so the fact that they did well isn't that surprising. What's surprising is that they did well without becoming Babylonian. They wouldn't bend the knee to Babylonian habits. And in chapter one, we see that Daniel and his three friends are like, yeah, we're just not going to take your food and your drink and your luxury. We don't feel right about it. We're not going to do it. And you can test to see if God will preserve us even without all your fancy food and God does and they rise to greater levels of prominence. So that's chapter one, then we get into the Aramaic section in chapters two through seven. And what we get here are, I don't want to cheapen it by saying adventures, but when you read it through the first time, it's adventures. It's grand exploits with high stakes again and again. And what you get is two sets of three adventures that are all connected with each other. So the adventures in chapters two and seven are a pair of dreams. The one in chapter two is a dream that Nebuchadnezzar has. The one in chapter seven is a dream that Daniel has. Daniel gets summoned to interpret the dream of Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar didn't tell them what the dream is. And Daniel's like, yeah, I know what you dreamed. He describes this statue with various layers of building material from toes up to head that are used to build the statue. And clearly it anticipates the churn of nations and empires that is to come in the ensuing centuries. And ultimately it looks like Daniel in interpreting this dream anticipates Rome and anticipates the arrival of the Messiah. Now really starting with Isaiah and a few key passages, but then really picking up steam in Jeremiah and really picking up steam in Ezekiel and Daniel, we keep seeing more specificity about what the Messiah is going to be like and what's going to happen. And indeed we get that here in a crucial passage in Daniel's interpretation of this dream in verse 44 of Daniel chapter two, and I'm going to straight up read it to you. He's saying this to Nebuchadnezzar in the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms, the ones depicted in the various building materials in the parts of this statue in the mechanism stream that parts that will aside his mind and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. Okay. We came on, we're doing the redemptive plan and this prophecy just further affirms that. Now Daniel's dream in chapter seven takes us to a whole other level as it employs imagery that anticipates the Persian conquest and then the arrival probably of Alexander the Great. That's sure what it looks like. The description, I mean, go read it for yourself really looks like Alexander the Great. And then it's okay if you don't remember all of your Western sieve history, but Alexander the Great conquers all of Persia in the three hundreds. And then he dies at a young age, the age of 33 in Babylon without appointing an heir. And so his generals just carve up the kingdom and have many empires scattered about Alexander's world. And one of those proves to be a huge thorn in the side of the Jews down the road. And eventually the Maccabean revolt in the second century is the overthrow of that military quote, unquote descendant of Alexander and the Macedonians or the Greeks. And it looks like all of that is anticipated in the prophecy in the second half of the book of Daniel starting in chapter seven with Daniel's dream. So we get those matching adventures in two and seven. And then we get the two beloved stories that are matching adventures in chapters three and six, that being Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the fiery furnace and Daniel in the lions den in both cases, these heroes of the story are like, yeah, we're just not going to bend the knee to your false gods. The king is no God at all. There's only one king and his kingdom is going to go on forever. And so no, we just can't play along with this thing. And they receive an edict of death in the case of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. That's from Babylon in the case of Daniel in the lions den. That sentence of death is from Persia. So it seems that not matter what empire we're talking about, they're all threatened by the real king and the real God. And also they both fail in their attempt to execute these guys for declaring that God is the true king and that his victory will happen. Then we get a pair of adventures that are hitched together in chapters four and five, one where Nebuchadnezzar loses his mind and is made to behave like an animal before he finally in his own words, repents and acknowledges the true God of heaven. And then in chapter five, we get the famous scene of Bel Shazar's banquet with the hand writing on the wall, words of judgment. Daniel again is summoned to interpret something that nobody else can figure out. And he's like, yeah, tough luck. You've been weighed and found wanting and this very night your kingdom is going to be taken from you. And it's going to go to Persia. And then it does. That happens that very night. But then in the second half of the book, which I'm just going to cover very, very quickly because I don't have the time or capacity to properly break down the complexity of all of the prophecy that happens there. In the second half of the book, you get a bunch of very big picture prophecy. One of the real downers in the middle of all of that happens in chapter nine when Daniel's looking at Jeremiah's prophecy about like, okay, we're supposed to be an exile for about this much time. We should be about done actually. And then an angel shows up and is like, no, so about that actually that is referring to a period of time that is going to go on even longer. And of course, Daniel's got to be like, no, no, no, no, no, but those timeline prophecies that we get in the second half of Daniel coupled with the prophecies that deal with the rise and fall and clashing of empires. All of that adds up to something that has captured the imagination and attention of Bible readers and interpreters forever trying to figure out how exactly the timeline works. What nations have to rise and fall? How do you count the number of years? Can you even count the number of years between rises and falls and the arrival of the Messiah and whatever happens after the arrival of the Messiah? And then Jesus himself references back to some of this material when he's giving a discourse about what's going to happen in the end of time toward the end of the book of Matthew. And so there's just a ton here to wrestle with. And a lot of people through the centuries have wrestled with it and said, this is meant to be decoded and we can figure out the pace at which history is going to unfold. And the moment at which the kingdom stuff is ultimately going to happen and all the nations will be defeated and everybody will acknowledge God is king and the kingdom will be established and visualized. I do not share that same optimism. I find myself more in collegiality with the people who look at it and they're like, this prophecy applies on like five different levels and the math on how it all unfolds is simply too complex to calculate on the front end. But it'll all look very, very clear on the back end as this unfolding of history occurs. What is crystal clear though coming out of Daniel, both from the narrative chunk and from the prophetic chunk is that God is the master of history and that the role of the person who is a servant of God is not necessarily to solve all of history and to figure out everything that's going to happen. But it's to be faithful in the interim as God unfolds history at the pace he's going to unfold it, but also anticipatory noting with hope and anticipation as these things unfold and do gradually over time come into focus. And just as a side note, I think the historical setting of Daniel is absolutely genius for communicating this point because you've got a massive churn going on here historically for the people of Judah. This is their grand calamity. It's an overhaul of their entire paradigm. Everything changes for them for Babylon. We see the apex of their civilization, but also their absolute defeat contained within the pages of Daniel and then we see the rise of Persia, but also anticipated after the rise of the greatest empire in history up to this point Persia. We anticipate their defeat at the hands of Alexander the great, but also we anticipate the defeat of Alexander the great by death and lack of planning, but then also we anticipate the defeat of his generals and their smaller empires and also we anticipate the rise of Rome and some sort of toppling of Rome all here on screen. Historically, there's not really a better moment in history up until this point that could have been chosen to undergird this grand message of Daniel, which is that God is sovereign over history and these kings might seem like the truest, realist thing, but they're not. There's a king who is greater. There's a kingdom who is greater. And even if you can't see it the same way you see these rising and falling empires right now, you will see it one day because God will bring these things to pass when you visualize the book of Daniel picture, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in a furnace, not burning right next to Daniel in Alliance, then not being eaten well in the background, a giant statue that is a monument to the glorious power of governments and the state and kings and empires gradually crumbles to the ground. If you visualize that, you won't have any trouble remembering the theme of the book of Daniel. And if you don't have time to read the whole thing, try to catch chapters one and six and make sure to go read chapter two verse 44 that I mentioned earlier for yourself. I got to say, as we wrap up Daniel, the anticipation for God's redemptive plan, flourishing and moving forward is really building. And I think it's very exciting. All right. I appreciate you.
