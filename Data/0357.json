I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. And have you ever listened to a comedy routine by Bill Burr? You know the guy baldude, he was on the Mandalorian for a couple episodes. He played a space scoundrel with the guns that he could wrap around corners and shoot at people, space lasers. I don't know if this is not ringing a bell. It's okay. You'd recognize a guy if you saw him. He sounds very Bostonian. He's got that Boston pugnacious attitude. I come at me. I'll fight you. And I don't even know what accent that was. Just ignore that. Don't judge me for it. And you know, 10 or 15 years ago, that tough guy, Bostonian comedy thing worked for everybody because back then you expected that comedy was just going to jab at everybody's sacred cows. Like get ready to feel ridiculed. We'll all have a laugh. We'll laugh at ourselves. We'll laugh at you over there and we'll get on with it. And maybe we'll be a little bit offended. But what are you going to do if ended as part of comedy? Well, now, I mean, come on. You know how it is you live in the world. We're trying to figure out how to coexist and get along with people who don't think the same stuff is us or come at things the same way. And at any given time, we feel like we need to do the kid gloves thing a little bit. And I look forward to when that evens out a bit more when we like each other enough and trust each other enough that we can just have a laugh about everything together. And we're all in on the joke and we all like each other. That's when you know you've got friends. But in the world of comedy, it's not really where we are right at the moment. You have to play to the base and there's certain jokes you just don't crack unless you're Bill Burr or Dave Chappelle. Bill Burr just hasn't changed a bit. He does not care. And it's part of why I really like him. And don't get me wrong. Bill Burr, I don't know, he can be off putting it time. Sometimes I'm like, hey, I disagree. That joke doesn't ring true, but it was really well crafted and it was funny. And I got to give you that. But what's fun about his not-careness is that he'll go to, I don't know if he's played York, Nebraska. Let's go with York, Nebraska. Now he rolls in there and he will crack a bunch of jokes that the home crowd are going to love. He will rib the sacred cows of the left-leaning part of society. And of course, in a red-blooded York, Nebraska, people probably think that's pretty funny. But then Bill Burr will turn around in that same setting and he'll rib the home crowd. He would jab a little bit, God, country, religion, things like that. He cracks those kind of jokes. And I would like to think the good people of York, Nebraska would have a laugh about that. They seem pretty reasonable to me. But maybe that would be a little tougher to laugh at because you're making fun of us. But Bill Burr goes on the road to San Francisco. He's going to do the same thing. He's going to play to the base and make some jokes at the expense of more of the religious types, the types that lean a little bit right. And then he's going to turn around. He's going to jab the home crowd. He just did it at the Grammys. A couple of weeks ago, he knew exactly who was in the room and he jabbed the room. Well, if you want to understand what's going on inside Bill Burr or any comedian or public speakers head, one of the things you got to know is who's in the room? When we interpret literature, when we interpret history, we have to take into account geography just like we do intuitively when we think about things going on right now. And the history and the culture of the people attached to any given geographical setting. And sometimes in the Bible, that's kind of important, but the words are transcendent and universal and it's just a nice footnote. But at other points, like where we are right now in Matthew chapter 15, we get to a passage where where this is happening is a really big deal. In the same way that if you want to know what's going on strategically in Bill Burr's head, when he cracks a joke at the expense of religious conservatives, you got to look at the map if he's in York, Nebraska, you got a decent guess as to what he was going for at that point. Likewise, if you want to understand what Jesus and Matthew are going for in different parts of the Bible with what Jesus is doing and Matthew is recording, you got to know where it's going down. And when you do, it really starts to come into focus. So yesterday, I told you that down the road, we're going to answer this question, wrestle with where Jesus was when all this Matthew 15 stuff is going down. But then I thought about it more. I was like, nope, we're doing it now. We're doing it right now. We're going to get into it right now. So here's the conundrum. Jesus was on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee within a few miles of his old stomping grounds after he finds out that his cousin, John the Baptist got beheaded at a big booze party with sexy dancing. And then he wants to go into retreat for a little while, but nope, that does not work out. People follow him. And then he feeds 5,000 people and cares for those who track him down, even though he's trying to get a break breather from everybody to just be sad for a while. Now before he can catch his breath, some religious leaders come along and they start barking at him about why his disciples don't wash their hands the right way. Jesus has it out with them. And then he's like, really, no, I'm getting out of town for a while. And he goes on this journey, which covers what looks like a pretty good chunk of time. I mean, it must just given how far he had to walk to cover all of this. But Matthew only gives us a part of the journey, only a couple of hints. We have to look at some other parts of the gospels to figure out where else he might have gone. So he goes up north toward Tyre and Sidon, which are out at the coast. We talked about those a few episodes back on that trip. He has this exchange with this Canaanite lady, which ends awesomely for her. And then in verse 29 of Matthew 15, after being way up north, it says, Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountain side and sat down and a bunch of crowds show up and we're going to get to that in just a minute. So the question is, well, what part of the Sea of Galilee and how would we know? Well, fortunately over here in Mark, which is another book of the New Testament. It's the next one. My name was Matt. I was the first born. My little brother was Mark. See what my parents were doing there. And they always cracked jokes like, we never did get around to Luke and John. Good one, mom and dad. So in Mark chapter seven, we get all of the same stuff, the controversy over stuff with the Pharisees. We get the encounter with the Canaanite or the Cirofanishian woman and then we get toward the end of this thing. And verse 31 of Mark seven, it says, then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre. Okay. So we're on the same road trip over here in Mark and went through side on down to the Sea of Galilee. Okay. That actually all sounds a lot like the trip that gets laid out for us in Matthew other than the fact that side on is an odd way to travel to get to the Sea of Galilee. That maybe what Mark is hinting at is that Jesus wanted even more time away. So we took a very strange, circuitous route to get to where he was going. But here's where we get our clue in Mark that for whatever reason, Matthew omitted. So then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through side on down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of something called the Decapolis. Okay. So the next question is obvious. What the heck is the Decapolis? Wow. You are smart and good at words. And I bet you don't even need me for this because you can break that down into two parts. You got Decca. So 10. And then you got Polis, which we usually think of just being something that comes at the end of the name of a town, like Indianapolis, Annapolis, Minneapolis, but Polis in the ancient Greek context doesn't just mean a town or a city. It refers to a city state. This is something that had a degree of independence. So Athens, Sparta, Thebes, all of these places were policies that would occasionally gel together in the Greek world with a league of other policies. And at times they would fight the famous Peloponnesian War battle amongst different leagues of policies. But to the modern historian, to the original ancient audience, to anybody coming before Jesus, that word Polis would not have conjured. Oh, it was a town. It would have conjured some notion of local self rule. You've got a local democratic government. It'd probably be more like an aristocracy or an oligarchy. And when we talk about the Decapolis, that is exactly what we're getting. This is a collection of city states, probably more than 10. The ancient historian Pliny accounts for 18 on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. So the Western half was all Israel territory. The eastern half, you got into some different stuff. Now ethnically, there were a bunch of ancient rivals of the Jewish people who hung out over there. But culturally, these people were Hellenized. Hellenized again refers to the process of becoming Greekified. Alexander the Great came through in the late fourth century BC. He conquered everything, most of it bloodlessly, but just up the road, he defeated Darius of the Persians who had been the overlord and the force of cultural gravity that had affected towns in the Nabataean desert, the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. And so they looked Persian-ish prior to Alexander's arrival. And then pretty quickly, they started to look Greek-ish. And that was very intentional on the part of Alexander the Great. He wanted to Greekify the world. He brought along single Greek people to marry local people. He scattered the Greek language and Greek- Republican democracy all over the place. And it really took in some of these towns. Geography aided the process of some of these towns becoming more independent than others. If a town was really, truly, profoundly important, like Jerusalem or Alexandria, I mean, Alexander is named after Alexander, so you see what's going on there, then they were going to be co-opted for the good of the larger Hellenistic world under Alexander the Great. And then later, under his generals like Ptolemy and Seleucis, generals like that who divided up all of Alexander's empire after he died at a young age. So the big towns are going to have a big government presence under the Greeks. And eventually they're going to have a big government presence under the Romans. But some of these little policies adopt a bunch of the Greek ways, but never really get brought under the bridle of Greek authority or later Roman authority. And that's what the Decapolis is. And one of the ways that we learn about these mildly independent city-states on the frontier of the Roman Empire is that, again, this great historian, Pliny the Elder actually writes about it. And I would like to read to you what he wrote. So Pliny the Elder who was touring around the neck of the woods during the Jewish revolt that ended in 70 AD with the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem had this to say about the Decapolis. But next idea is the Decapolis, which is so named after the number of its cities, but not all authorities agree about their names. Most writers, however, agree that Damascus is one of the 10. This town is on the banks of the river Chrosoros, who I tried. Well, that's it's in the neighborhood of something like that, which is eerily used to irrigate its meadows, the cities of Philadelphia and Raffana. Wow. Our H.A. and I am going through a fauna are in the direction of Arabia, Sithopolis, Sithopolis, which father Liber Dionysus used to call Nissa after he'd buried his nurse on this place. owes its present name from a city and colony that was once established there. Gidara, also called Garasa, which we've talked about at different points as we've worked our way through Matthew on the banks of the river, a hieromix, Hippo Dion, Pella, rich with its waters, and finally Galasa and Kanatha. These are a bunch of towns that I've not heard of. This is my voice again, by the way. That's not plenty's voice anymore. These are a bunch of towns that I'm not that familiar with. I mean, obviously a couple of these stand out. We think of Damascus, which is a capital of Syria and it's on the road to Damascus that further on down the road and acts. We have Saul having his encounter with Jesus on that particular route. And one of these towns, I think is modern day Amman, the capital of Jordan. I don't remember which one that would be. The Philadelphia that's mentioned here is not the Philadelphia that is mentioned in the book of Revelation. You remember they've got those seven churches that the book of Revelation starts with Philadelphia that is talked about in Revelation is in modern day Turkey. It's near the town of Ephesus is not the same town. Okay, we need to dig deeper into the history of all of this stuff, but I'm just going to need more time. So this is going to be one of those two partners. We'll just pause right here and pick it up right where we left off tomorrow. Hey, thank you to everybody who's supporting the program at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast. We've now mailed out a whole bunch of those Matthew Field Notes books.
