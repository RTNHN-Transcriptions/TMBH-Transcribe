And right now, we're going through Esther. I would like to think that we're pretty honest with each other around here, and I would like to think that something that I have been very honest about is that I have a bordering on unhealthy appreciation for the Denver Broncos. They're a terrible team. I don't know why I keep rooting for them. I can't help it. The heart loves what the heart loves. And I love that particular American football team. I don't know anybody who plays for that team and I have any reason to really like it. And I grew up around there. And that's the team that I like. But that's the team that I like. And they are very, very bad at football right now. And this last weekend, as I'm recording this, they lost a football game 70 to 20. It's the most points any team in professional American football has given up since Lyndon B. Johnson was president. Pretty sure that's right. This season was rough, man, because the whole off season, I mean the football, it's a very narrative driven sport and new coaches and new players and other teams are doing this and that. And there's drama and all the different local sports talk stations follow it and you read the articles and you check the Twitter lists and you see everybody get all geared up and you're like, all right, this year we're going to do this. I think we're going to see an improvement in the run game on third and short situations. All these narratives, right? And then the season starts and the Broncos come out and they lose on a Sunday to the Raiders. And then seven days later, they lose to another probably pretty bad team, the Washington commanders. And then this last weekend, they got blown out by 50, which theoretically shouldn't be possible. They found a way and it occurred to me that I've been following this great big long story for the entire calendar year leading up to this moment. And then it literally took seven days and the season was over. That's it. Just there was the climax. That was the drama. That's it. When the wheels came off, they came off super, super, super comically fast. And so just like that in basically an instant, all the tension is gone. You know how the thing is going to work out. It's not going to be a successful season because teams, I mean, they don't really bounce back from losses like that, especially when they're losses at home. It's like you go on and on and on. Here's the point. We've been following this story of Esther for a real long time and there's a lot of build up here. There's a lot of history. I'm going all the way back to the Assyrians and now the Babylonians defeated these Syrians and how Cyrus defeated the Stijegis, the mead and then how Cyrus defeated the Babylonians and how Cyrus let everybody go back and rebuild under the leadership of Persia. You can go back and make the temple again, but then some people didn't want them to make the temple and so then they had to write back and be like, they've made a stop building the temple. But now there's a new king who became king in really weird, clever, dramatic ways. And he's like, I'm not aware of this deal at all. And then he goes and he looks at the royal archives, he's like, wait a dang minute. There was a decree and he doubles down on his like, you can keep building the temple and also here's some money to do it. And somewhere in there the temple gets built and dedicated. And then that king who said that they could do it, he died. And then his son took over and then he invaded Greece and he lost. And then he got in a fight with some lady and some guy and real weird things happened. He broke up with his wife and then he had a big super sexy contest and Esther won the contest and then he was going to get assassinated and then Mordecai saved him from getting assassinated and then before Mordecai could get any credit. Some jerk Haman comes along and he gets credit and Haman becomes the right hand man of the king and Haman wants to kill all the Jews and Mordecai and Esther Jews and it's a great big huge problem. What's going to happen? And then Esther is like, I got to go talk to him, but you get killed if you're not supposed to go talk to him. And then she goes and talks to him and he's nice to her. And then she has a party and she invites the king and she invites Haman to it. And Haman feels real good about it. His friends are like also, you should totally hang Mordecai in the next morning. Haman goes to hang Mordecai, but the king added trouble sleeping and he read through the Chronicles and he remembered he needed to reward Mordecai. And so instead he had Haman get Mordecai big preyed all around the city and this time for the second banquet and the second banquet. It's just like the Bronco season. You get all that build up, all that ramp up, all that crescendo. And then in chapter seven, it's just over. The wheels come off so fast for Haman. The tension is resolved. And that's that. Here's how it goes. King and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. And as they were drinking wine on that second day, the king asked again, Queen Esther, what's your petition? It'll be given to you. What's your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it'll be granted. Then Queen Esther answered, if I found favor with you, oh king, and if it pleases your majesty, grant me my life. This is my petition and spare my people for this is my request. I don't think the king probably saw that one coming because he didn't know that his wife, Esther, was Jew for I and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and an annihilation. If we'd merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet because no such distress would justify disturbing the king. King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, who is he? Where's the man who's dared to do such a thing? And without any hesitation and really not much drama or build up at all, Esther said the adversary and enemy is this vile Haman. Well, here's what happens next. Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen. The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman realizing that the king had already decided his fate stayed behind a beg Queen Esther for his life. Why Xerxes walking out the door and says he was in a rage. Maybe he's mad. He's one of those people who punches through drywall or goes and stomps around so people know that he's mad. Some people really didn't know that they're mad. Maybe he knows he's a temper and he knows that he's made in temperate decisions in the past and he just needs to go out there and thank for just a minute. Maybe he has somebody else that he needs to go out there and talk to. Maybe some of the unique advisors are out there. They're going to come to play here in the story in just a little bit. Either way, whatever he's doing out there, what's going on inside is that Haman is an absolute wreck. This guy is in a terrible mental state. He thought that he was going to have the best day of his life going to this banquet. No doubt to be honored again. He thought he was going to get to hang his arch rival Mordecai. Well, impale and then hang up real high above. He's in the height of the city walls so that everybody could see how dead that guy was and how awesome Haman is and how you better not mess with Haman and everybody bow to him and everybody's going to bow to him forever. But the whole thing has gone sideways. He had to give Mordecai a parade and then he went home and he looked for some support in the arms of his tender, gentle, spirited wife who would never suggest murdering anybody and his drunken friends and they're all like, dude, you are at a luck. Don't know what to tell you, including his wife. She's like, there's nothing you can do. You just done for. I'm so sorry. I guess probably after that, they're never going to see each other again. That's probably the last thing that he ever heard from his wife. And then at that moment, the knock is at the door and Haman gets hustled off to this thing. Who knows if you had a time to get cleaned up? I mean, the guy is just an absolute mess mentally. And now he realizes that he has an enemy. He didn't know he even had Esther. I mean, he's got this moment of shock and horror when she says this where a couple of things are going to occur to him. I suppose the first of those realizations is going to be, wait a dang minute, she was Jewish all along. So she knows about my idea. She heard me talk about the idea. Oh, no, I said a lot of really mean things about Jewish people in front of her and she was totally Jewish. She is not going to be happy. It would be cool if she didn't mention me. Oh, she mentioned me. Okay, maybe the king won't be me. Nope. He's super mad. He's doing the outside stomp garden thing. I got one play left. And so out of desperation, he goes over and he has to beg. His new enemy for his life, but it's a ridiculous pleading. It rings as hollow to me. The reader is it rang hollow to Optimus Prime when Megatron and Transformers the movie was groveling around at his feet, begging for mercy. He was without mercy. Now begs for it. Embarrassing, really, but more than anything, it demonstrates how far this guy has fallen so quickly that he now has to throw himself at the queen and hope that what was a very well delivered and cleverly crafted plan is something she really isn't all that committed to after all and that maybe she'll just be nice, even though he was actively trying to murder her, her people and Mordecai. I think it's interesting to note that the author of Esther doesn't give us any sense of her response. There's no sense that she was like, no, you're going to have to die. Or I'm super sorry. Let me think about that a little more. Well, it's not really my call. We'll have to just see how the king feels when he comes back in from outside where he's being mad right now. Nope, nothing. The whole scene gets interrupted before she really weighs in in any way, but for Heyman, surely his wife and his friends words are still ringing in his ears. Those being the words when they said, since Mordecai before whom your downfall has started is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him. You will surely come to ruin the soothsayers have sooth said fate has spoken. Heyman is a guy who believes in fate. And so for him to go and beg Esther for a different outcome is really for him to abandon his belief system, his faith as well. Someone deeply committed to a pagan notion of fate suddenly is trying to thwart what quote unquote fate has obviously determined the outcome of the situation is going to be all year long since the last season ended. I have sunk my teeth into the narrative about how the Denver Broncos season is going to be. New players, new coach, so much excitement, so much tension. But when it finally got to the moment of action, I was stunned at how quickly it was all over. And I feel the same way here as I look at how quickly things unravel for Heyman and how quickly this scene unfolds. There's a little bit more drama to go here in this scene and we will look at that next time around. It seems like because of the intonation of my voice that I was about to say the thing about how now we're done, but not quite yet because as I am recording this the last couple of days, I hung out with a bunch of you. A whole bunch of people came out for the big ridiculous silly thousand episode party that we did on Monday night at a park here in town. It was awesome. There were no turds. Everybody I met was super super cool. If you came to that, thank you. I think I told all of you. Thank you personally before you got away. But if I didn't, I'm telling you now or maybe I'm telling you now again, you are awesome. That was a blast. That should not have worked socially, but it totally did. And that is a testament to you all being really, really cool. Surely we can do something like that again someday and hopefully I'll have the opportunity to meet a whole bunch of new people and also see a bunch of you who were able to come. Again, we did a little pastors conference. There were 20 some of us in a room and we talked about the state of the world and what things used to be like doing church and trying to do kingdom stuff in the world. We talked about how that's changed and we talked about ideas for where we are now and what it looks like moving forward. And I thought it was such an encouraging conversation. I'm so grateful to everybody who was able to be there for that as well. It was just a really awesome couple of days. Thank you so much for that. Now it's going to be the end of the thing. I'm Matt.
