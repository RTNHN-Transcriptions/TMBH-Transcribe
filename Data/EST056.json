And right now, we're going through Esther. So we're in Esther chapter two right now and over the next few verses, we're going to be meeting the two main human heroes of this story, Mordecai and Esther. And the introduction at least of Mordecai goes like this, Esther two, five. Now there was in the Citadel of Sousa, a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai, son of Jayar, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Kish, who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, among those taken captive with Yahoyachi and King of Judah. Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This girl who was also known as Esther was lovely and form and features and Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died. I ask you something and by asking you, I mean, ask you a question and then tell you a story. Did you ever have to move away when you were a kid? That was brutal for me. We lived in Eastern Iowa when I was little. My whole family is from the Mountain West and kind of this triangle between Denver, Colorado and Rapid City, South Dakota and more or less Yellowstone. That's us, this kind of Mountain West family. But we didn't grow up that way. I lived in Iowa. You know, dad was going around to school and doing different things and he had a church who's a pastor at a church in Iowa. So that's all I really knew and seemed normal to me. It didn't feel like we were a displaced family from what we knew culturally, from what our roots were. So I loved Iowa and the Iowa Hawkeyes were good at basketball back then and I didn't really understand what that meant. It felt like group identity and then we moved. We moved to Fort Collins, Colorado after the summer of my fourth grade year and that was really hard because I didn't know anybody. And I'm like there for a couple of months and we're starting to school and people could only see the tip of the iceberg of my history but there was all this other history and I wanted them to know it. And so I leaned really hard into, you know, I'm from Iowa and that was my thing. That wore off eventually. Notice respect to Iowa. I still think you're a lovely place. And then the same thing happened again. When I left high school and I went to college in Chicago, I felt totally estranged from where I'm from and what makes me me. So I really leaned into that Mountain West identity when I was a kid trying to find my way in college. I just think there's a lot to this idea of who you are and where you're from and where your family's from even in the age of a total obliteration of most of those lines. I mean, we have grabbed the ant farm of planet Earth and shaken super vigorously in terms of who lives where and what those identities mean. And I don't know, jury's still out. I think that's probably an okay thing. But it is a little bit jarring, right? When you move or get moved around because like it or not, we're connected to place and we are products of place and the rhythms, the seasons and the stories and the legends and the legacies and the shared heartaches and the shared victories and the contributions of whatever place we're from and whatever place that we're a part of. And of course, this is the situation as well in the ancient world and particularly when it became fashionable in the mid first millennium for big empires to come along and force other people groups to move the Syrians did this a whole bunch, particularly in the 700s and the 600s. I mean, that was the fate of the northern kingdom of Israel in the Old Testament. That's they got relocated and their identity stripped from them and them lost to history. And then it happens again to the southern kingdom in 586 BC at the prediction of the prophet Jeremiah under the direction of the military leader Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He comes along and he destroys what's left of this people group or at least their connection to a place and he takes the remaining few away into captivity. And as they march away into captivity, surely they still have the words of the prophet Jeremiah echoing in their ears that God is faithful and that he still has plans to prosper them and not to harm them. But there's going to be 70 years either precisely, literally or somehow metaphorically that are going to have to elapse before the next thing happens. And well, it looks like that prophecy is fulfilled in the arrival of the Persians and Cyrus the great and his successor Darius who continues Cyrus's edicts and impulses and eventually the temple gets rebuilt and the exiles return. But there's a whole identity thing in there, right? And I think it'd be just picture the little kid version of yourself that had to move or you picture the little kid version of your kids who you had to move and what that did to them. You can imagine at some teeny tiny little fractional level what it would be like for the Jews who were still in Persia now almost exactly 100 years after this forced move at the hands of the now long dead King Nebuchadnezzar leader of the now long dead Babylonian Empire. That is to say you can imagine that these people had been through some stuff and you can also kind of imagine what the identity of the Jewish people living in Persia a hundred years after Nebuchadnezzar's conquest would be like they'd be well Persian, right? I mean at some level they're going to have adopted a whole lot about Persian custom and style their political realities that there's just no getting around if you're a Jewish person living in the Achaemenid Empire in Persia. They control the money they control the law they control the rules they decide when you go and fight people and who you go and fight they decide what gets built and what it looks like but also it's abundantly clear that the Jewish identity continued to thrive through this time as well. Now it's an odd thing that happens here because 70 years passed from 586 BC to the completion of the temple in 516 BC and a whole bunch of the Jewish people who were in Babylon and Persia went back and did that but as we see from the book of Esther and this character Mordecai who were about to meet in Esther chapter 2 and verse 5 well a whole bunch of Jews didn't go back then Cyrus's edict was very clear we have it more than once. Everybody was allowed to go back if you wanted to you could sign up and you could be a part of that so clearly the Jews who were still in Persia for whatever reason didn't want to. I think it's really easy to besmirch them or imagine that they weren't faithful to God or there was something defective about them in terms of their faith or religion or whatever but come on think back to what we were talking about at the beginning bro remember how hard it was to move when you were a kid remember how jarring these identity things are about ourselves and how we're connected to the place where we were brought up the place that we imprint on. I know a whole lot of people who are transplants but still hang on deeply to their college football rooting identities or their cultural regional identities. Probably made a ton of sense for some people to get right back to Jerusalem as quick as they could and it probably made a ton of sense for some really good people not to for example again Mordecai who we're going to look at here in just a minute Esther who is the human hero of this story and then also Nehemiah who was the cup bearer to the king Artaxerxes I mean it was really important that he didn't go back to Jerusalem is a good thing that he stayed in Persia and again in that very famous letter that very famous prophecy from Jeremiah to the exiles clear back in the day he was telling them that God has plans to prosper you and not to harm you and right there in the immediate context of that very famous verse Jeremiah is telling the people I go there work for the benefit of the city be great at living in Babylon and I think by proxy at living in the next empire that will also own the city of Babylon that being Persia be great at that contribute to its well being faithfully well looks like Mordecai had done that already and as we go through the book of Esther we're going to see that he did more of that and of course Nehemiah who I just referenced obviously was contributing to the benefit of the city the empire that he was a part of even if he did have divided geographic loyalties to some extent I think there are two reasons that this whole transplant psychology and the emotions that go with that is a relevant topic for what we're looking at here in the book of Esther one is the big main characters who were rooting for Mordecai and Esther are transplants and this is a human story about human beings and we can relate to them and understand them better because we can empathize with what it's like to be transplanted and to feel the identity challenges that come from all of that as we've been discussing throughout here but reason number two is that the narrative tension of the story hinges on the idea that there is this Persian empire that is meant to be cosmopolitan and bring all the people together and kind of mush them together under one grand authoritative umbrella but within that empire there is a distinct group that predates Persia and the empire and it's the Jews and secretly Esther who's about to become queen is a part of that people group and that people group is about to be threatened and so this whole question of ethnic identity and geographic identity within the larger context of Persia is really important to the story as well that might not pop quite as hard for us as a modern audience but I think it would have sprung off the page for the original audience. We'll get into more about what we can figure out about this Mordecai character and his family and why he's described the way he is and this cousin of his who he has charge over named Esther next time around.
