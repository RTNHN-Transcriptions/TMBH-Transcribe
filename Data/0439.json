This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast and I know what a lot of you are thinking right now. I hang out with Matt quite a bit and he has a voice like a prepubescent boy and all I'm hearing here is lumberjack masculinity and I refuse to accept that it's the same person. I don't know. It requires a lot of disease but this is how I sound when I'm in this stage of six. I know here we are. Hey big thanks to Jeff Foote for jumping in and covering the podcast yesterday on Zero Notice. That guy is good at things. But it's been a good week on this stupid congestion thing that I'm dealing with because it's anniversary week and I really like my wife and it's been many years of happy marriage for us. And so we decided to go out on a date and we went up into the Black Hills which is where we live. Mount Rushmore territory is beautiful this time of year but it's very, very crowded this year. So I'm finding myself anytime we want to go eat somewhere you got a hustle and even as I pull into the parking lot a lot of times I'll have a member of the family bail out and go get our name on the list because just the amount of time it takes to park can be enough for five or six groups to get in ahead of you. And then you got to think about that the whole time you watch them getting seated and you're sitting out there for an extra half an hour waiting to get into grab a bite to eat. Well last night we went to Hill City. There's this cool German restaurant called the Alpynia and they only serve like two things on the menu. They got a fillet and they got some European German ethnic thing that I can't pronounce. So everybody knows what they're getting. It's beautiful. It's very popular and it is teeming with people as we pull up. So I parked the car really quickly. We hop out and I'm hurrying right along because I can see that again it was five, six, seven groups all making their way toward that door. Well because of my attentiveness I get ahead of all of them and the closest group is about 20 feet behind us it's a couple of ladies but I was feeling really good that I'm going to be the first one to the check-in line. So we get up there we get checked in the ladies great. She says it's going to be about two hours and gives us a little buzzer thing. Two hours bummer which I'm not excited about but this is a really special place to eat and it's a beautiful evening. We'll go walk around. It's just fine. Well the two ladies who are behind us were disappointed to hear the amount of time as I'm patting myself on the back for being first of this new rush of people. A couple of bikers walk in who apparently had run out of daylight and they walk up to the two gals that I beat to the door and they're like I think we've got to be up next but we're just at a time do you want this and they gave them their spot in line and the thing immediately starts buzzing and in that moment and I'm not joking right now the emotion that flashed within me was this is going to be really great for the podcast because I'm talking about the first being last at the end of Matthew 19 and I need to cover that this week. I busted my butt maybe even sacrificed a little bit of dignity to make sure that I was first looking out for my lady looking out for our evening looking out for us but the joke was on me because if I just hadn't worried about it and I've been like well if people get ahead of us they need to eat too and just been chill about it I would have been rewarded by actually being first and it's not just a weird equation to think about at all like should I have been a little more humble so I could get more stuff and either way the way I just characterized it to you is all predicated on me caring about myself and me getting things first. This is a very tricky question to even engage with and it's tricky when Peter brings it up at the end of Matthew chapter 19 after the rich young ruler has walked away sad and Jesus says all this stuff about camels and needles and all of this business and then Peter just to read it to you in Matthew 19 27 says we've left everything to follow you would then there be for us as Jeff covered yesterday very effectively I might add Jesus said to them I tell you the truth that the renewal of all things when the son of man sits on his glorious throne you who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and regardless of what one might make of the grand unfolding of future things according to the Bible there's a pretty clear distinction here being drawn between the 12 disciples and Israel so at the very least as we talked about yesterday it looks like there's a role for both and there's still some more stuff that needs to unfold here but ultimately the idea is that there is this new family of faith and that the completion and the fulfillment of all of the stuff that we've seen rolling around through the gigantic chunk of Bible you have behind you right there is stuff we call the Old Testament the completion of that is realized in the kingdom and in the establishment of the subject of the kingdom this new family of faith so that in and of itself is an answer to Peter's question he's like what are we gonna get out of the deal well I don't know if you really end up being in a position of gigantic authority and being vindicated in front of everyone who's irritated with you including the people who eventually are gonna crucify you upside down you might enjoy this little tidbit you're going to be in a position of clarity because you're actually in the right here and you're not just sons of the king you are heirs of the king you are agents you have a role in this kingdom and it's a significant one is Jesus talking about the individual disciples there or the church as a whole he's gonna go off into a big long speech here in a little bit that will help us get more to the bottom of that but what I do know is this promise of position as something to do with Peter's question what do we get you're gonna be in these roles I mean you're trading out short term stuff by hitching your allegiance to something that is definitely going away for long term stuff of value by hitching your allegiance to something that is going to exist forever and the verse 29 Jesus continues his answer to Peter he says and everyone who's left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and I'll inherit eternal life so in addition to being in a position of responsibility in the kingdom of the great king you also have the thing where you live forever and that's a reflection back on the original question set this whole ball in motion remember I mean the rich young ruler showed up and he asked teacher what good thing must I do remember was it to be in the kingdom or to be a Christian or to give my heart to you know the question he asked was teacher what good thing must I do to get eternal life and then as we've covered at great great length Jesus reframes that question in light of a kingdom context and kingdom values and in light of a right posture before the king something that this I think nice young man pretty clearly at least at this point in his life lacked but here Jesus is saying anybody who ditches all the things that are comfortable all of the world currency stuff even good and beautiful world currency stuff like family stuff that nobody in their right mind could get after you for caring about people who leave all of that stuff and there's eternal life with a great return in order of magnitude return and by talking about this receiving a hundred times as much Jesus is harkening back to this productivity theme this reward theme that he's touched on a bunch already very notably in the kingdom parables discourse in Matthew 13 when we get the most famous parable there about the sewer or the seed that lands on the good soil produces thirty sixty or a hundred times what it originally was this also gives us a little bit of a preview of the parable of the talents that we're going to get to in a few chapters here where master gives everybody some coins and the expectation is going invested and get a return on it will break that down later on and this is probably pretty difficult for Peter to hear because we've got enough context clues to say I think I was probably married he probably had left spouse and children behind at least for this chunk of time so he'd never see him again but he's taking huge risks at this point he doesn't know if he's ever coming home or now I mean for kind of loud the guy was so into this thing he walked into the middle of a raging sea during a storm barefoot into the depths I mean there's a chance that he's not going to come out of this thing alive and no doubt he's thinking about what might have been given up here but Jesus isn't asking Peter to go somewhere he's not willing to go and remember what Jesus said at the end of I can never remember is it 12 it's got to be 12 right yeah where Jesus family came to claim him while he was teaching and he's like hey who are my mother and my brothers and he points to this new family of faith my true mother and brothers and sisters they're the people who are doing the will of my father in heaven so again family very important is a beautiful important thing but this new family of faith would seem to be the even bigger deal which I understand is a challenging thing to make compute because it seems like nothing would be more transcendent than family other than an even truer realer family that never gets old and never ages and is never separated by death and is headed by a patriarch who never ever ever goes away and is benevolent and provisional and just and good in all of his leadership for all of eternity I mean in that case I guess it would be a better family and then it comes back to the stuff that I was talking about at the beginning but many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first the desire to weasel to the front is not a kingdom value it's reflective of pride of self and of not assuming the right posture before the king so it doesn't make a lot of sense given all the other values of the kingdom and fairness to all of us who are just reading this thing through together chronologically at this point in the text we're still gonna have questions about this paradox at first last last first how does that actually work I mean it kind of smacks of the blind can see and the people who can see you're actually blind but we get this goofy chapter division that is not part of the actual Bible this is after the fact here between chapters 19 and 20 I don't think there should be any division here at all I think it creates a little bit of chaos for the reader because the next thoughts we're going to look at in chapter 20 flow directly from this statement that Jesus just made which flows directly from the question Peter asked about what then will be there for us which flows directly from Jesus saying it's easier for a camel to go to the Ivan needle in a rich man into heaven which flows directly from the rich young ruler asking what he has to do to get eternal life it's all one big block of thought and we're about to get another kingdom parable coming up next it starts with the old familiar formula for the kingdom of heaven is like and then at the very end of that parable in Matthew 20 verse 16 look out it says again so the last will be first and the first will be last so I guess we want to understand Jesus closing statement here we're gonna have to work through that parable to get it a little bit better that is a new episode of ironwood rhino that came out this week I think it's really super good and interesting of greatly appreciated the feedback from those of you who listen here and then made their way over to ironwood rhino you are connecting the dots on what I'm going for there I want to do these thought exercises about things that are right at the boundaries of the natural and the knowable because I think our ability to process things in that realm has atrophied a little bit in recent years and I think that thought exercise we're doing over there of thinking about the abstract is only going to make us better at what we're doing over here and hopefully what we're doing on ironwood rhino will also make the conversation you and I are having here the big conversation that much more accessible to a whole bunch of people who right now are on the outside looking in I appreciate you thanks for enduring my voice I'm Matt this is the 10 minute bimalower podcast be this again", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end":
