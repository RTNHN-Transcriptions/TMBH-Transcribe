It's fast, fun, free, daily, deep dive Bible. And right now we're working on the book of Nehemiah. If you're new, welcome. You can jump in right here or you can always go back and start at the beginning of any season. The whole podcast is available in an easy to use format at thetmbh.com. I lose it tennis a lot and I'm okay with that. And today I had a lunchtime match with my favorite person to play with. He is all gentleman, all class. The body language is always classy, classy and victory, classy and defeat, but absolute sports gentlemen and really good at stuff. Super athletic, iron man, just wonderful guy, wonderful guy to compete with across the board. He said delight. If I'm not going to win at tennis, then my favorite people to have win would be my son, my daughter or this particular friend. So we're playing today and he's just slaughtering me and that's fine. I'm taking my loss. I'm starting to think about the conversation you and I are going to have here and some of the psychology of tennis and sports and my dad, which we'll come back to in a minute. And he gets up five zero. We're playing to six games. So it's going really fast. Then he's up 40 love, which means he's one point away from winning the whole match, which is also fine. I'm serving. That's the last point. I'm just going to hit one real hard, not mad hard. I don't know. I want to walk off the court having swung my hardest at least one ball. So I did. And everything kind of clicked. It's like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's how I grip it. That's what I'm doing. That felt pretty good. And then the tide turned and this is very flooky. This never ever ever happens, but I came all the way back and I ended up winning that one seven five. Obviously, it should have gone the other way. Bunch of flooky circumstances. My friend was a total gentleman about it as he is every single time and he'll get me next time. He's great. But then I'm thinking about it, driving back here, knowing that I'm about to jump on the microphone and talk about all of this. I'm like, you know what? I really care about how everybody is doing who listens to this. I care about you and I hope it's going well. I care about what you think and when you give me feedbacks, even when it's not totally positive feedback, I care about that. I would want you to like it. Yeah, I care very much what you think, but I'm driving along. I'm like, you know what? But not about this tennis win, but you know who's approval? I really care about. I hinted at it earlier. I still care about my dad's approval. I really want him to be proud of me over competitive things, athlete things. Still, I think that's good, right? It's a sign of a great dad who did a great job growing up and was always there and always attentive, winner loss, always ready to teach life lessons, keep you humble. If you happen to win on a given day, prop you up. If things don't go the way they should, lessons to be learned in either circumstances, just always there. And I still find myself eager. My dad's coming up. He's going to be here tomorrow and I'm really eager to sit him down and be like, dad, you played this crazy match and this is what was going on in my head and this was happening. I actually won. And for that conversation, I'm going to be looking in his eyes like an eager child and hoping that he's kind of impressed. But if you're not, that's okay, but I don't think I'll ever not desire my dad's approval. There's something very, very special about that particular role. God calls himself a heavenly father. People call God, heavenly father all throughout the Bible, but they don't normally throughout the Bible get that kind of direct feedback that we crave from a father or dad here in this world. However, there are a few weird occasions where you're wondering where we're going. It's coming around. It's coming around. We're getting there. Weird occasions where God shows up and very tangibly tells somebody, hey, nice job. No, really good job. I fully approve of this. I'm really happy with how it went. I'm proud of you. Great work. Paraphrase is mine. Obviously, the most prominent of those is in Matthew 3, I think also Luke 3, where God shows up at Jesus baptism and is like, hey, this is my son in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him. Do what he says. He's saying that's pretty good, but then it's not just Jesus who that happens with. We see other moments of affirmation and confirmation from God. We go all the way back to the beginning of stuff with Cain and Abel, right? They both show up with sacrifices and Abel brings this stuff. They God was like, that's the stuff I wanted. That's what I wanted you to do. It's okay if you don't totally understand. That's what I wanted you to do. And Abel does it. And in so many words, God's like, awesome. Great job. And then Cain is like, I don't want to do it on your terms. I want to do this other thing. And God gives him very direct feedback as well, being unimpressed with that. And then there's the dedication of the temple and second chronicles that we were talking about last time around. You get this direct approval feedback from God and everybody's eager for that from their heavenly father, right? They did all this stuff. They built this big temple. Like, do you think that you told our king Solomon? You told his dad, David, that you wanted this to happen? So we built it. It was very expensive. We have all these laborers we brought in. We got the finest stuff from all over the place. We even gave the pillars names. So we did that. All of this is meant to be exactly what you said to do. All of this is meant to honor you. Now we're going to dedicate it. We got a whole bunch of animals that you like. We're doing all the sacrificial stuff that you have, like everything you've ever said that you like. We're doing it because we want your approval because you're good father. So here's everything. These prayers, this music, this celebration, all of it is meant to be exactly in keeping with your character and your values and who you are. So we dedicate this thing to you where we hope you will dwell with us just the right way. And in the midst of all of that, 2 Chronicles 7, 1, it says, when Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. The priests could not enter the temple of the Lord because the glory of the Lord filled it. When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground and they worshiped and give thanks to the Lord saying he's good, his love endures forever. That is a great moment, a great moment. I mean, yeah, the grand scheme of history and all that stuff that we always talk about every day, but we're today, we're talking about wanting your dad's approval. They actually got it. Look, I've never had some kind of supernatural affirmation from God where the laws of time and space are broken in ways that are tangible to my five senses inarguably, even in front of other witnesses to have God reach across the supernatural to the natural divide to be like you, Matt Whitman, episode 731 of the Matthew podcast. That one was very good and I am very pleased. And so I am going to emulate this stack of branches you'd collected from all your trees in your yard with fire from heaven so that you know absolutely for sure that was the good episode. Great job. Nope, it's never happened. I don't resent that. That's absolutely fine. There's no promise from God that he's going to do that every single time. It seems like most of the time the way it does is you got the Bible and you got reason. You got God's character and I mean Romans 12, one and two, right? Therefore I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy to offer your body's living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. This is your spiritual act of worship. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is his good pleasing and perfect will. I memorized that in 11th grade and I've said it's one of the ones that's just still absolutely drilled into me and I appreciate that somebody had me memorize that one back then because it makes it feel okay that fire from heaven has never come to supernaturally confirm that you're on the right track. I haven't felt like I need necessarily that kind of dad approval, that kind of fatherly approval from God because according to the passage, I just quoted Romans 12, one and two, there's enough there that you can know if you have the approval of God. If you're on the right track, I think that's what it's saying at any rate. It's very optimistic about your ability to know that, but still, if it happened, yeah, I would take that. That would be very helpful. I would welcome that and that'd be a pretty special, pretty memorable thing, especially if I took a big giant swing in front of everybody with tons of money and my reputation and my rain and the reputation of my family and everything to try to do a thing for the right reasons again, very publicly, not just in front of my community, but in front of the whole world, neighboring tribes and people groups who might not even like me very much. And then God, father in sort of a dad approval way is like, yeah, I just want to make it really clear that that's great. Boom. Here's a breaking of the laws of time and space to make that evident. And so Solomon and the assembly, they get that. Isra and Nehemiah and their people, they've been chasing that ever since. They want that feeling again. They want that approval. And maybe your relationship with your dad isn't like mine. Maybe it's rough. I'm sorry. That probably makes this conversation a little bit painful on some level. That's not my intent. I also don't want to apologize for the fact that my dad's awesome and I still have him and I love him and I crave his approval. And somewhere along the line, I get the first taste of what that was like in a really healthy way. I lost that craving for that. It's like there's a compass there. If dad says this is going all right, that's okay. There's a blessing there that nobody else can give. There's keys to the heart that nobody else has other than my dad. And here in second Chronicles 7, God's chosen people and King Solomon get that. And then over the ensuing 600 years, it feels like it doesn't happen much more. And I don't think it's because God is being a jerk or being distant. I think it's because everything went off the rails. That's Ezra's opinion as well. It's also Nehemiah's opinion. They both said so in their prayers, Ezra 9, Nehemiah 1. And I mentioned yesterday that we were going to talk more about Solomon's prayer and then God's response that is reflective of his approval all around this dedication to the temple stuff in second Chronicles. And we didn't get to it today. We talked about the rest of the dedication stuff. That's okay. We got time. But what an amazing thing to have got you up and give his approval in such a public way. I'm not surprised it left a generational mark on the Jewish people. And what an amazing thing for Solomon to experience what happened starting in second Chronicles 7, 12 where it says, the Lord appeared to him Solomon at night and said, I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices. And then he goes on to say a bunch of other awesome things as well that Nehemiah would have in view when he's saying the stuff that he's saying that we're looking at Nehemiah 1, that all of the pious Jews who are aware of the big story would have in view as they're trying to rebuild the people and rebuild the walls. And finally, just to balance things out, I'll try to make sure to make a quick note for you of the next several times I get annihilated at tennis so that we can all have a healthy laugh at my expense. Just when I do tell you that, please don't tell my dad. All right, I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
