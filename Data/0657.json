How many participants were there in the first ever communion at the Last Supper? All right, Jesus of Nazareth, that's one, and then he had 12 disciples, apostles, it's like 12 tribes of Israel, so there's 12. So 13, right? But here's the thing, I think there were actually 14 participants because one of those guys had a parasite like Venom. When the Last Supper was happening, according to Luke 22 and wherever it is over in John, I guess it'd probably be 13, Satan had already entered into Judas at the time the Last Supper happened. So I pose this question to you now. Did Satan take communion? How does that even work? What a bizarre thing to think about that Satan, according to the text, was present at the scene that we're looking at right now in Matthew chapter 26. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I think Satan was a born-again Christian or anything or that he meant any of this or that he was participating in any way other than what in his mind would have been a mockery. And maybe for a lot of you who listen to this, you're like, man, I really like the narrative stuff. I really like thinking about the teachings and the structure and the way the books put together, like thinking about the original audience, the extra biblical history. But when you get into the spiritual stuff, it's a little too much. Maybe you're thinking, yeah, I just, I don't know what to do with that. Or maybe you're thinking, I do know what to do with that, which is rejected. I just don't think there's a spiritual world. So whenever we're talking about demons and Satan and stuff, it's weird. Cool. I am still glad you're here and I totally understand your perspective. That said, Luke and John still tell us very explicitly and in a certain place in the chronology that Satan entered into Judas and is somehow operating through Judas as some kind of host who is still culpable for his behavior and his decisions, but who is also under the influence of the epitome and embodiment of all evil. Now, I don't know if Judas knew the Satan was in there. For that matter, I don't even really know what it means for Satan to have been in there. I don't know. I've never been possessed to the best of my knowledge. So I couldn't really tell you what that feels like. And the text doesn't really give us any indication as to whether Judas knew that he was willfully cooperating with the Lord of darkness or not. But yet here we still are sitting down to initiate this most treasured of Christian expressions of worship and unity with each other and with God. And if the rest of the Bible is to be believed, Satan is in the room when this thing gets kicked off wild. We've spent the last few days looking at the run up to the part where Jesus actually gives out, I guess what we call the elements of the, what would become communion, what would become the Eucharist. And so you got this little aside. I think it was an aside at least in verses 25 and 26. Yeah, just 25 where finally Judas is like, yeah, it's not like, it's not me, right? Jesus is like, yeah, it's you. And then right after that, that is right after that, assuming this is part of Matthew's narrative that is arranged chronologically, we have to acknowledge the fact that Matthew doesn't always do things right in order, but I don't see a reason for him to tell this part out of order. I don't know, let's just play along and assume that he's telling us in order. You got this little aside and Jesus calls out Judas. Apparently the rest of the room doesn't know that Judas has been singled out yet. Maybe they suspect him because he's kind of been a turd about some other stuff. Maybe they're also worried that the accusation could be directed toward them, that they're not thinking straight. Whatever the case, the meal gets back on track in verse 26. It says while they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it. And he gave it to his disciples saying, take and eat. This is my body. For those of you who are here who go to church and are Christians, you could probably accidentally almost recite that verse from memory just because you've heard it so much every time you take communion. And I understand that different traditions do this in different ways, obviously. And I also understand that they don't always use the same script. I have got a little pink sticker right here. I'm going to let you hear the little pink sticker. That right there. Is the little pink sticker that has been on my Bible on page just a second. 1,769 for 10 years, probably 10 12 years. I've had that sticker right there because whenever we do communion, our church would use first Corinthians 11, which is just a little bit different. We'll get to that in a minute as our text to set up the communion ceremony, that part of the worship service. I was like, you know what, I just want to be able to flip there really quickly and neatly in case I forget to market or something. So I have this permanent pink sticker that has been there since the dawn of this Bible. And 1 Corinthians 11 involves Paul giving instructions to Christians who had already seen this Lord's Supper, Last Supper, communion, Eucharist thing, incorporated into their meals and all of their time together. And apparently some abuses had come up as part of this thing. And so he's writing overwhelmingly to correct people who are doing church weird and 1 Corinthians. But very famously he writes in 1 Corinthians 11, 23, for I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you. The Lord Jesus on the night he was betrayed, took bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, this is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. In the same way after supper, he took the cup saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me. Or whenever you eat the spread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. I don't know why I just read that to you because it is so drilled into my brain from all the years of doing communion that I definitely have that one on lockdown. And maybe you do as well. What we see though from the fact that this is coming up in 1 Corinthians, which wasn't written that long after the events of Matthew, is that this thing that was initiated here, it did set stuff in motion. It definitely was understood by the disciples to be something that should be repeated, that it meant something that it pointed to this greatest culminating point in the redemptive plan that was about to happen on the cross. In fact, the very fact that Paul is writing to correct bad behaviors surrounding the Lord's Supper to the church in Corinth a few decades later indicates that not only had it had time to catch on and be a thing that all Christians did, but it also had time to spiral into chaos and to become a thing that some Christians were starting to abuse and get wrong. So it's pretty evident without going even one step outside the Bible, just even looking at two little passages like that, it is pretty clear that this was something that was immediately a central part of the worship and the expression of union with God that took place amongst all Christians in the early church, though there is room for more debate about exactly how they understood it. But that is probably a conversation for a day when we have a bit more time. Let's just look at the nuts and bolts here of this communion thing. And I just want to keep in the back of our minds the whole time, like Satan's there to just see this thing that is a dedicated expression of unity between God and his new family of faith, like Satan had to sit through that whole deal. And I don't know if he was sitting there thinking like, yeah, this is fun that you think this is going to do something. It's not going to do anything because I know I'm going to get you killed in a couple days here and surely I'm going to win. I don't know if that's how Satan's brain works. Again, I've never talked with him. I've never been possessed by demons or Satan to the best of my knowledge. So I'm not totally clear on his knowledge level on stuff or how he thinks about things. Maybe you just would have had a clearer take, but maybe Satan is sitting through this thing and he's like, ah, well, I'm going to give this my best play. But I don't know. Like my friend Jeff says about the St. Louis Cardinals, they're just never dead. They never ever ever go away. Even when it seems like you've got them completely knocked out. They're always still in contention. Maybe that's where Satan was at with God at this point. Maybe just feeling beat down and like, well, you know, this is my best swing, but God's always sorts these things out. It's always two steps ahead of me, whatever. And this is probably going to be a stupid thing that's going to be a thorn in my side forever and ever and ever. And now I have to sit here while they kick the thing off for the first time. I'm going to hear these words repeated in my ears nauseatingly until the end of forever. Great. I don't know. It's kind of fun to speculate though. The nuts and bolts of it are pretty simple. They're sitting there eating. Jesus takes a bread. He gives thanks. He breaks it and he gives it to his disciples and he says, take and eat. This is my body. We'll talk more next time around about what he meant. Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them saying drink from it. All of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Okay. It sounds a lot like all of that business that we've pointed to so many times. The words of Christ where he says, the son of man didn't come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. I mean, it's, you know, it's right there. We've also got this idea of a new covenant here, a fulfillment that is of an old covenant. That seems like it's playing off of what Jesus said. He was going to do in Matthew 5 17. Don't think that I've come to abolish the law in the prophets. I haven't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them also more on that next time around. Then he says, I tell you, I'll not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the day when I drink it anew with you in my father's kingdom. And then they sing a hymn and they leave a couple of things I find remarkable about this. Number one, we've been talking about the whole time through Satan would seem to be in the room. Not sure about the implications of that, but very interesting to think about thing. Number two, look at how simple this is. Jesus took the most basic thing other than maybe breathing and found a way to institutionalize it into a thing where even something is basic as simple nourishment, hand to mouth, food and drink is a reminder of one's total dependence on this redemptive work of God. He could have initiated something way more elaborate and would add all kinds of interesting symbols and it could have worked really well, especially for super smart, fancy academic types, but instead he picks something that is immediately accessible to literally everyone ever who has ever been a human. Because if you've been a human and you've been alive for any amount of time or any amount of time that involved cognitive awareness, you ate stuff and you drank stuff. And I think it's fascinating that he went so, so very simple and how he was illustrating all the stuff that he's illustrating here theologically. We're not done on this. Oh, we are not done on this. More last suffering tomorrow. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
