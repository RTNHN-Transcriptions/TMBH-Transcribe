but the important person the leader good guy bad guy doesn't matter they've got sidekick and the sidekick is sort of their mouthpiece they're the spokesperson maybe they got a bullhorn or something and throughout the movie sidekick mouthpiece guy gives all these speeches on behalf of the leader but then at some point the leader is like you're not no I need to say this part gimme gimme that and I'll take the bullhorn or the microphone and then they're like attention it is I so and so talking now listen very closely this is important I have seen that happen a lot of times and I find it to be a very relatable moment where it would make sense that with all the busyness of an important good guy leader or an important bad guy leader you wouldn't have time to focus on all of the exact syntax and speech writing stuff you got to be working on the ideas and other things and it would make sense you would have somebody who would play that role as a part of your team but then it would also make sense that from time to time you'd be like now this is too important or they just need to know that this is for sure coming from me and not my sidekick they need to know that there's no intermediary here this is me talking I want to put all my weight and all of my authority behind it so attention please I'm talking now well I think we're getting one of those kind of sequences here at the very end of the book of Galatians most of the letters it looks like in the New Testament were not penned by the people who are signing the letters they were actually inked and written down by sort of a human printer sort of a human word processor and for all of our lives you and I we've had a device that does this for us a typewriter a word processor a computer heck AI does the writing for some people I'm not into that but I know some people do it and we've all had some sort of mechanical assistant that does this for us well back in the day there was still a demand to process words is just that had to be done by a human with a brain who is trained for it we called them scribes and in Galatians 611 Paul is acknowledging I am using a scribe in this letter well in so many words he is because he effectively yanks the bullhorn away from his faithful assistant who seems to have died a very lovely job I've read the whole book several times it's very very good excellent even but he still Paul is like I want my authority to come through here I want people to know this is from me so Paul metaphorically grabs the metaphorical bullhorn from the not metaphorical sidekick and is like attention please please please this is Paul Paul himself self self ccc what large letters undersolders I use as I write right right to you with my own hand hand hand and so of course the interpretive cue for you and me is that we should look really closely at whatever he says next and oh trust me my friend we're gonna right after we think more about the implications of the fact that Paul has somebody else writing his letters is that weird now you might be thinking okay well no I've heard about this before you've mentioned it a few times that this is a new testament practice but it's actually a practice that we see in the Old Testament as well in fact there is a very important character in a gigantic book of the Old Testament who is in the plot he's a part of things he's a part of all the messes and crazy misadventures and dangerous stuff that happens to the named character of the book and the scribe of the book the assistant of the book he not only helped write the thing but he features very prominently in the story as well and the book I'm talking about is how many of you already said it because I don't want to deprive you of looking cool in front of people so if you haven't said it yet and you know it and you just want a bunch of credit you why haven't you blurted it out yet are you really that humble it's Jeremiah and Jeremiah's got this buddy named Baruch who is helping him with all of his bibling and Jeremiah let me see he spans the seventh century to sixth century gap he's getting started in his career probably at the very end of the six hundreds and then of course Jeremiah he's the one whose prophecies nobody likes because his prophecy is we blew it God is sending judgment in the form of Babylon it's coming I'm just gonna tell you in advance here's how you're gonna need to live when you get taken into exile and so you know Jeremiah is not well liked and there's a ton of narrative in Jeremiah that people kind of forget is there until you go back and look at it but my point is here we are 600 ish years before the time of the New Testament letters and we see the practice of having a secretary or a scribe being closely involved with what's going on with a prophet of God we see that practice in place and Baruch he's not a sidekick he comes off like a a deputy prophet who has authority and is doing the legit official stuff here so then the question becomes okay well what about the New Testament what about these guys who are writing the words on the page now Paul says of course in Galatians 6 10 now when I was doing that fake bullhorn echo a second ago that was really the that verse Galatians 6 11 is the only reference in Galatians to ascribe and it's you kind of yeah a little bit you got to read between the lines to understand what's going on there but we see more overt references in other parts of the New Testament take for example the first one I remember noticing after several readings of the Bible as a kid I never caught it it just kind of flew right by and it was pretty jarring when at some point I did catch this I think it was probably early in college that I first noticed it but this is Paul's concluding remarks at the end of Romans get this I urge you brothers to watch out for those who caused a vision and put up schools in your way that are contrary to the teaching you've learned keep away from them for any goes on this and you know such people they're these flatter it's problem the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you I read that verse because I just love it I mean it's like the whole plot of the Bible it's there's this serpent and it needs crushing and here at the end of Romans we get a nod back to that story that starts at the beginning in Genesis and fully rounds out in Revelation and right here you're like wait we participate in the crushing oh I don't know exactly what that means but cool it goes on Timothy my fellow workers send his greetings to you as do Lucius Jason and so Sipater my relatives I you expect the next word to be Paul right but it's not I Tertius who wrote down this letter greet you in the Lord huh in that fascinating somebody else wrote Romans I mean but come on that's semantic right Paul wrote Romans Paul's got his name and his signature all over it is just that this Tertius fellow got to you know shine through for just a second like hey Paul would it be okay if I shouted out a greeting as well yeah yeah of course man yeah you know these people yeah sure go for it so there that is I mean there's just no arguing biblically if you think the Bible is accurate and reliable and it's from God there's no arguing Paul didn't physically write Romans somebody else participated in the process of that Jeremiah didn't do everything in Jeremiah Baruch helped him out first Corinthians 16 21 through 22 it's the same kind of ending stuff we're gonna talk about these endings in more detail later on it says I Paul write this greeting in my own hand if anyone doesn't love the Lord a curse be on him come oh Lord the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you my love to all of you in Christ Jesus amen okay well that's sort of similar to Galatians in terms of the hint that we get there right after Galatians at the end of Colossians chapter four we're gonna talk about Colossians quite a bit in the upcoming season because this town of Colossae comes up in the context of Philemon which is our next book Colossians 4 16 through 18 after this letter has been read to you see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea tell archapace see to it that you complete the work you have received in the Lord I Paul write this greeting in my own hand remember my chains grace be with you now quite possibly there were a couple letters that were scribed and sent off to Colossae here we'll talk about that more in the next season so it's possible that a guy named Ticakis did the writing it looks like he was the guy who carried the letter it's also possible that some of these letters where Paul is referencing help I mean it might have been even Timothy who was around depending on when these things happened second Thessalonians 3 17 is gonna round out our little Bible adventuring today how do you find second Thessalonians will you just thumb through the Bible until you find a T book because all five T books are together and they are all in alphabetical order do you know that already probably because I've told you but I tell you these things so that they will stick because these are the kind of goofy little Bible hacks that have really helped me out as well now me the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way the Lord be with all of you I Paul write this greeting in my own hand which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters this is how I write the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you okay so look what is the Bible how did this all happen oh my goodness it's 11 minutes and 30 seconds what am I doing I'm asking the question what is the Bible and we're totally out of time so we're gonna do it what the heck is going on with the Bible episode tomorrow and I think it's going to be great all right I think that is properly tantalizing we'll pick it up where we left off tomorrow I'm Matt this is the 10 minute Bible hour
