This is a 10 minute Bible hour podcast. I hope stuff is going awesome in your world. It seems like planet Earth is a little bit wobbly right here at the moment. Like a lot of us aren't exactly sure to make of where big things or little things are headed next. But man, every time I just go outside my front door and talk with actual humans, it feels like, yeah, stuff's all right. People are all right. People I disagree with. They're actually pretty reasonable, pretty cool most of the time. People I agree with, they're actually pretty reasonable, pretty cool most of the time. Hopefully, I am pretty reasonable, fairly cool most of the time. There's just been a lot of incidents here in the last few days when I'm reading the news and looking on the internet where I'm like, man, the wheels are coming off the world. And then there's a lot of incidents the last few days where I stop and I go outside and I breathe the air and I spend time with actual humans and I feel like, and there's a lot of beautiful things and a lot of beautiful blessings from God in the world as well. There's been an interesting contrast. I had one of those contrasts yesterday. I was watching the Broncos play football on a Sunday afternoon and around here in the Black Hills as I'm recording this were right into the end of the golden season. We had bright gold on all the trees for a few weeks and it's beautiful. And then those of you who live in a climate like mine, you know how this works. You get one big windy day or some rain or a little bit of snow and all the leaves come off all in one day and it goes from magical golden fall colors to, oh, now it looks more like Thanksgiving just overnight and that's what happened. And so this year for whatever reason, the wind blew the right way and all the leaves went into our yard and my son decides that he's going to tap out on football for a while. I mean, the Broncos lose a lot. I get why my kids don't like to watch it. And so he goes outside and he grabs this new leaf blower. I bought a crazy high powered leaf blower this year and he went to go out and goof around and he blows the leaves from the whole yard into this big giant pile and then at halftime, he's like, dad, come out and watch the things I got there. And he wanted me to film him jumping in slow motion into the leaf pile. I go out there and this is nice fall crisp in the air and the sun is starting to go down and everything is perfect amber, Auburn gold. I mean, it's just magnificent. It looks like a drug commercial on TV or something like with inquisadex, you can get back to doing the things you love like watching kids jump in leaves in a perfect idyllic fall setting. Yes, things like that. It had exactly that kind of feeling. So we get the camera set up and he jumps in the leaves. That's pretty cool and everything. And every time I go back in, he re stacks up the leaves and he's got some new way he's going to jump into the leaves. He brings over a little tiny stool. He's like, got him to jump off the stool now. Okay, buddy, let's do it. I'm going to film that thing. And finally, after four or five rounds to this, I go out and he's got a ladder set up. And he's like that. I'm just going to get to the top of the ladder. I'm just going to fall off of it. It's going to look so cool in slow motion. And I had been cool with everything right up to that point because I knew it wasn't going to kill him, but I looked at the ladder and the height of that and the relative density of that pile of leaves. And I thought, nah, no, I think we're going to skip the ladder thing, pal. That's just a little too much. And clearly what I'm doing there is something you all do as well, which is I got my limits. I'm cool with risks and stuff seeming crazy and out of control. It's fun. That's a living. I want a parent that way. But at some point, I also want my family name to carry forward into the future. And that young man is the lone bearer of that family name. And also, I understand, look, it's going to be a little squishy hearted here and just tell you the truth. I also am really fond of him. So terribly proud of him, super love him. Still want to see him get hurt. So it's like, no, that's just too dang far. And we all have those limits and we all allow a certain thing up to a certain point. But then we also all eventually protect our offspring or the people in our care. Likewise, yes, I just want to tell you about this beautiful fall and dillic moment with my family. But likewise in the Bible, you see the same kind of stuff. You imagine God as father and you don't really have to imagine it. I mean, those are his terms for describing himself. And you imagine the people of Israel, the Jewish people as his children. You don't really have to imagine that. He characterizes them as his chosen people. And you kind of look at that relationship, big picture. And what you see is there's a lot of opportunities given throughout the narrative of the Bible for the Hebrew people, the Jewish people, God's chosen people to get into some pretty crazy hijinks, some stuff that is even at times risky, even at times overtly destructive. They're allowed to make massive mistakes, carry out huge miscalculations with really very significant consequences, much more significant consequences than I would be comfortable allowing my kid to take on. But this is still this is story of things. What you get throughout the whole Bible. But what you notice is that throughout the whole story, God's got his limit. He's got his metaphorical ladder. Or is like, Oh, no, no, no, this is too much. And now I'm going to step in and intervene. And we're going to stop that. It occurs to me. This is another one of those Bible illustrations where I get to be God or Jesus. I need more where I'm the idiot because it sounds all narcissistic. I think you know what I mean. I think you know what I'm driving at. And so it looks like the boundary marker is so often that God just isn't going to let his people see complete ruin. He is not going to let this family line descended from Abraham to whom he made certain promises that deliverance would come through the line of Abraham, that this redeemer is going to set everything straight. It was going to come through the line of Abraham. He's not going to let the line of Abraham perish. And there are several times when the descendants of Abraham kind of get up on the ladder and they start behaving in ways that could bring an end to this lineage through which the redemptive plan and the Messiah is going to happen. And some of the incidents are absolutely bonkers in Genesis 38, one of the descendants of Abraham, a guy named Judah for whom the tribe, the biblical tribe of Judah is named. He has got some weird issue with his family. He's got some sons, but they're not producing an heir and some of it is kind of out of stubbornness. And one of the sons is married to a lady named Tamar and then that son dies. And so it kind of falls in the Iron Age, super ancient world. It kind of falls to the next brother to make sure to provide an heir. So I mean, that's what I mean, you know, hey, it is what it is different times. I'm not for that system at this point in history, but that's what it was. I guess. And he doesn't want to do it. And so I always talk myself into these corners when we hang out together. What's the euphemism for this? Um, he, he is willing to go part way toward fulfilling that brotherly obligation, but he bails out on that so as to prevent an heir from occurring. That was terrible. I don't know. You all are smart. You get it. And he famously dies. This guy's name is Onan. He just dies right there in Genesis 38. And you don't get it really even spelled out in the text other than it's like, Hey, he did evil in the eyes of the Lord. You're supposed to do the thing. We need this. There has to be an offspring here. And then Genesis 38 goes into absolute crazyville after that. But the end result is through some really strange stuff. Tamar ends up having a couple of kids, one of whom is Perez and Perez is in the family lineage of Jesus at the beginning of the book of Matthew. And can you see what I'm doing here? We're getting back toward Esther. I know we're talking about Esther right now and we're at that part where something really big is happening in Esther. And it's going to fit into this category of things that happen in the Bible where the whole redemptive plan gets up on top of the Bible. And the metaphorical ladder is about to jump to its demise. And God steps in through different means to prevent that. That's what we're doing. If I didn't already make that clear enough, other examples, how about the Exodus, right? God's chosen people are in their, and what you could call it, they're in their first exile, right? They're in Egypt and comes time to be done with that. God miraculously demonstrates that he is real and that it's time for the Hebrew people to go and have it. And then you get them backed up against the Red Sea or the stereotyped sea as it were.grade. And it looks like they're all going to die. That's going to be the end of everything. These are all the descendants of Abraham stacked up right here. And then what happens, the most unlikely thing ever, exactly the right moment, the sea parts they walk through on dry land. The chariots of the Jews, the people of the Jews, the people of the Jews, the people of the Jews, the people of the Jews. The people of the Jews, the people of the Jews, the people of the Jews, the people of the Jews. The chariots of Pharaoh chase him in there and then the water closes in and they all drown. I mean, what an amazing visual metaphor for God taking his people right up to the ladder or allowing his people to go right up to the ladder, metaphorical danger ladder. And then he's like, nope, nope, we're not doing that. I'm going to bail you out, even if it requires a weird breaking of the laws of time and space to do that. I'm just not going to let this people group be destroyed. You know, whether they are obeying me or whether they are not. Then you think about the way the conquest works out after they wander in the desert for 40 years, they go in the book of Joshua and they attack the city of Jericho. And that should not work out. Jericho, I mean, castles, the way that works is an orbit. If you have a walled city in the ancient world, even up through medieval times, you control a whole region. There was nowhere for the Hebrew people to go. They were either going to have to take that city or go back out in the desert and just gradually die. And then, I mean, it looks like again, if you lose to Jericho, you're just done for. And there we are on the metaphorical ladder. Dad, I'm going to jump. Oh, yeah, it's a little too high in the walls come tumbling down, of course, then the story of Jericho and the conquest as a success. And really, we could do this all day. If you flip over to Matthew and you look at the opening genealogy here, this is story after story that comes to mind. I mean, Abraham was the father of Isaac. That's the first one. Well, there's a pretty dramatic right on top of the metaphorical ladder. Are we going to let you drop off the metaphorical ladder and kill off this line? No, at the last minute, we're going to step in and make sure that is prevented. Okay, what else we got here? Okay, there's the Judas story with Paris. Man, that's a doozy. Genesis 38, go read that one if you want to, but don't bring the kids. Oh, yeah. How about this one? Another kinsman Redeemer story here in the genealogy of Jesus. You got Ruth and Boaz. That would have been the end of the line right there as well. Then in this situation, Ruth and Boaz, who Boaz gets right, what Onan didn't get right back in Genesis 38. That's a good one. And then King David is in this line. How many crazy close calls and brushes with the death of the line that would lead to Jesus happened in his lifetime? What else we got? There's a rubable from the exile. I mean, if that guy doesn't survive the travel and the frontier and the danger and resistance that occurred with putting back together Jerusalem and the temple, that would disrupt the line. And then all the way down to Joseph. And then for that matter, how about Joseph, the unsung hero of Matthew, who socially was under all kinds of pressure to ditch Mary when she turns out to be pregnant, but instead he believes God, just like Abraham didn't. It's credited to him as righteousness. And God says the crazy stuff like go to Egypt. What? It's super expensive and far away. I don't speak Egyptian. Tough go. And so the way he goes, and he protects his son and nurtures his son and takes care of his wife. Now even there is a close call with the story of Joseph. So the point is all over the Bible, you've got these moments where the redemptive plan, which God voluntarily hitched to one people group and one lineage within that people group is on the precipice of destruction and is standing up on the metaphorical yard ladder, getting ready to jump in such a way that they might not know that that's too high. But the father knows that's too high and okay, right here, we're stepping in and we're going to stop that. And we see that there's a variety of means used throughout this biblical narrative, some of which are very subtle, even familial, others of which are grand violations of the laws of time and space and physics, others of which are political that preserve this line so that we can get that genealogy at the beginning of Matthew so that Jesus can come on the scene. God in the flesh, the Messiah, the Son of God, the ultimate sacrifice for all of sin, the initiator of the great kingdom, the king himself. This is who we've been waiting on. This is who has been promised all along the way. And yeah, there have been a lot of metaphorical lawn ladder close calls, but they all work out. And in the stuff we've been looking at in Esther and specifically in Esther chapter eight, we're seeing another one of those moments with the metaphorical lawn ladder. And we're right up at the edge of destruction. But here it is a political and military solution guided by the providence of God from behind the scenes that is ultimately going to preserve that line and that redemptive plan that is going to lead to Jesus like I was talking about a minute ago. All right, I think that's plenty for now. Matt, this is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this against him.
