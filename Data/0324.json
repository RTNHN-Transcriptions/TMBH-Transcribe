In this episode, we're going to be talking about intimate human relations and intimate human relationships interfamiliarly. It's going to get weird. That's the point. It's going to get real, real Bible weird. And so if you were thinking that maybe you were the one who wanted to have that talk with your kids and not me, then you should listen to this first before you listen to it with the youngsters. Well, that said, let's get after it. This is one of those moments where I sit down and I turn on the microphone like, I already do it anyway. I'm at Matthew 14. Oh, this is the thing about Herod and his brother. Oh, it's that story. I look at the story and I think to myself, well, I mean, I've got some stuff that's happened in my life where people have come to me and said things to me that were only irritating because they were completely true. And that's what made their comments so odious. But I just look so bad in those stories that I think I'm going to skip the specifics and just go with this. So everybody's done a bunch of stupid things. At some point or another said something dumb hurt people's feelings, been selfish, taken idiotic steps, fudged things here, whatever, everybody does dumb things. I get it. That's part of life. Hey, if you've done dumb things too, forgiveness and patience and long suffering high five to you, my internet friend, we have that in common. However, a lot of the stupider things that I've done or said along the way, nobody ever really called out just happened. And then 10 or 20 years later, you think back on that thing and you put your hands on your head, like the first time Tom Brady won the Super Bowl and you go, Oh, what was I doing? Oh, Whitman, you idiot. Think about how they came off to everyone in the room and you replay it in your head. And this moment of self awareness and pain washes over you as you realize you were the Michael Scott in the scenario. You were worse than Michael Scott in that scenario. And in the moment, you felt cool and justified. And like you were the one hosting the party and that everybody thought was awesome. It kills me to even vaguely allude to these moments of realization that I've had. But at other times, something that isn't quite actually as bad has occurred, but it feels worse in the moment. And that's when I do something dumb. Maybe I think I'm doing the right thing or being terribly clever. Maybe I was trying to be a turd, but I do something dumb and somebody who is right comes up to me and is like, Hey, you're doing things that are wrong. And I in that moment do not want to hear it. I am hosting a party here. I am entertaining everyone. I am totally in control of the situation. And the last thing I need is you, Mr. moral conscious guy, busting up my groove with all of your lecturing about how bad and wrong I am. But at times that person has had to be my conscience because mine wasn't doing the job. And in the moment, wow, it triggers so many different emotions and temptations to react and knee jerk reactions. And if you've ever had somebody call you out on something that you probably needed to be called out on, you know this rarely is your first response. I'm so wrong and you're so right. Thank you so much for bringing this to my attention. No, you want to justify or if you're like pulling some long term scam here, you're trying to mess with people or get away with something or you're being a little bit calculating and selfish and somebody calls you out on it. The knee jerk reaction might even be like, Oh, I just like really dislike you. And I just want you to go away. You in that moment might experience the temptation to even despise the person who is telling that truth because they I'm holding up two little fingers and I'm like, it's like I'm pointing it at somebody's eyes right now in the back of mine because they see through you. They see through me. They know what I'm doing. They know the little angles I'm taking. They know the ways I'm cunningly justifying it in my mind and how I'm peddling it to others. And they're calling me on my crap and it cuts all the way to my soul. Now, eventually some of the times I've had people be bold enough to confront me, people I know, people I trust. It's gotten through the armor quickly enough that I was able to salvage the disaster and acknowledge they were right and I was wrong and I could change. I could stop hurting people or, you know, whatever I was doing in other situations. I was like, no, no, I'm going to ignore that and I'm going to ignore it with hostility and frustration. And I'm even trying to badmouthe you a little bit so that you don't get any angles and so that your evaluation of me doesn't get any currency. And I feel an ending shame for this, though I think I have gone back and tried to clear up every single one of these relational mistakes that I have made where I've responded wrongly to someone who was brave enough to speak truth to me. I think that embarrassment and shame still lingers with me of how wrong I got it a few times when people took a risk to try to tell me things that were true for my own benefit and for the benefit of others. The point is when somebody gets after us and they're wrong, that conjures one emotion. Like, yeah, we're indignant and maybe we're outraged, but also probably just have to be the bigger person and laugh that one off. When someone gets after us and they're right, that is what can draw out the crazy. That is what it can cause us to do the surprise shrieky demon Bilbo that's scrambling for the ring and that is exactly what went down in Matthew chapter 14 between John the Baptist and the proud, sophisticated King Herod Antipas, the Tetra. John the Baptist looks at what's going on in this guy's life and well, I've always John the Baptist have to lose. He just hangs out in the country dressed up in animal furs and eating bugs and honey and stuff. And he doesn't have anything to lose. So he just says stuff more on that in just a minute. Let me just actually read the text to you here. We've been away from the actual text of the Bible for a few days working on the background of Herod Antipas. Now we get to the payoff. So here's the text. Matthew 14 one, it says at that time, Herod the Tetra occurred the reports about Jesus and he said to his attendants, this is John the Baptist. He's risen from the dead. This is why miraculous powers are at work in him. Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother, Philip's wife for John had been saying to him, it's not lawful for you to have her. Now Herod wanted to kill John because he was afraid of the people and because they considered him a prophet. As we discussed, Herod and his whole family did their best to hold themselves out to the Jewish people and to the observing Roman overlords as being pretty Jewish and certainly in tune with Jewish religion, they had to keep up these appearances in order to get by. I suppose I'm not well positioned to be the final arbiter of whether or not they really believed in any of this God stuff or scripture stuff, but their behavior looks like it's moving in a different direction than kingdom values. Whatever the case, Herod Antipas has done something here, relationally that you and I could debate in terms of current sexual cultural mores, but in terms of Old Testament cultural biblical mores in terms of what the common person would have thought in Jewish culture about their leader's behavior would have been unacceptable. Leviticus 18, I should have written it down. It's 20 something speaks to it. What's this one? And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out. Now that's a good verse. I haven't read about that one for a while. Dada, here it is. No, that one's about bestiality. Dang it. Where's the verse? Leviticus amigos. It is a charmer. Here we go. Verse 16 of Leviticus 18, do not have sexual relations with your brother's wife. That would dishonor your brother. And the award for most obvious verse in the whole Bible goes to Leviticus 1816. You think that would dishonor your brother? You think there's a chance your brother might look at that and be like, hey, what are you guys doing? Knock it off. That's super dishonoring to me. Because I think, yeah, that verse squares with how people are and how reality is. So it's one of the most smoking gun versus an all of ever. And Herod Antipas, this guy who is by merit of his position, a religious leader in the community, has just completely flouted a foundational societal law that is straight out of the Bible that all of his subjects believe is directly handed down from God. He just do not care. I don't know. That erodeus lady must have been really charming, really pretty. Instead of kicking himself for how dumb and unsophisticated that was, he's going to get mad at the person who pushes back on him and double and triple down on the disgrace by arresting the whistleblower, arresting the brave person, which anytime that happens back then or even now, the message is the same, right? It's not just a message to that dude to shut up. It's a message to anyone else who might want to run their mouths. Do you want this fate right here? You end up in jail? You want to end up with your heads on a platter? Okay. Then how does everybody feel about my wedding to this lady? Now everybody cool with it? Great. Then we have an understanding. I just made it moral. Have a good evening. So we're having halfway through the story yet and already Herod looks dead wrong and John looks dead right. I would say pun not intended, but I think deep down somewhere that pun was probably actually intended, whatever you go, what I mean. So there we have it. The tension is set up though. I don't feel like we've yet properly plumbed the depths of all of the moral components of what's going on here between these two people. So we're going to take another day on this passage. I continue to be not like snarky or I don't really mean it, but I just say the word humbled, but like actually humbled by how many of you have signed up recently to support this whole thing at patreon.com slash the TmbH podcast. Again, you don't have to do that. It's free. It'll always be free. I really like doing it, but man, that helps so much to free up my brain, to free up my time to make this something that I can continue to throw meaningful effort at every day. And what I'm also appreciating is how many of you have taken the time to shoot me a note back over the last few weeks here. I've tried to just shoot everybody who's supporting the program a note to say what I just said here. Thank you. That's awesome. And a bunch of you have written really cool things back and I've read every single word of every single one of those and I'm going to continue to do so. Thank you for that encouragement as well. It's been particularly fun to hear the pride. The appropriate pride and sense of satisfaction that so many of you have articulated about rightly feeling like you're accomplishing something here. You've put in time, you've put in effort, you've put in investment and your bust in your butt and working hard to make a habit of really getting a book of the Bible nailed down to the place where you get it inside and out and where you've carefully unpacked it. And I agree with you. I think it is an achievement and I am humbled and honored and appreciative that it isn't an achievement that you and I get to work together on and that we get to own together. And what's even better about it is that while I know not every single person in the conversation here agrees with me on this and I can respect that. For those of you who do agree with me on this, I think it's particularly cool because I think there's a God on the other side of it. And I think the stuff that we're getting into is transcendent and gets us into the deep water and the big stuff about life and death and love and existence and all of the big questions. So I'm excited about this. I love doing it. I'm Gosh, and too much. I appreciate you all. A map is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast.
