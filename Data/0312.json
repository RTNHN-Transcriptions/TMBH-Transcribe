The term that we're going to be looking at is Nashing of Teeth, but I intentionally did not in any way investigate what Teeth Nashing actually means because I thought it would be more fun to discover it together. So here up front, this is what I picture. When I hear the term Nashing of Teeth, I picture Marge Simpson being upset at her family and I'm like, I don't know what sound Teeth Nashing makes. It was like the grinding maybe that you do at night when you're sleeping and you're having some kind of aggressive dream. I really don't know, but I assume it means some kind of angsty, grouchy thing that maybe people in the ancient Near East did when they were mad about stuff. That's my guess. The reason I bring it up is because we are in Matthew chapter 13 and this is called the Kingdom Parables Discourse and we're looking at an oft-forgotten, overlooked parable called the Parable of the Net. So in the Sermon of the Mount you give us details on what the Kingdom is, what the values of the Kingdom are and you did it overtly. Kingdom Parables Discourse on the other hand is more anticipatory in nature as it anticipates what questions, honest people were going to ask about what they're seeing. So it's stories that mean something and Jesus fully acknowledges to his disciples. Yeah, some people are going to get it and some people are going to not get it. And if you are here and hanging out with me, it means that we are people who would at least like to have eyes to see and ears to hear. We would like to understand what's going on here. I don't know if that means we're actually going to get it, but I feel like we're doing well. The question that we dealt with yesterday is why is the parable of the Net and the parable of the Wheat and the Weeds? Why are they both in this same larger discourse? It looks like they're saying roughly the same thing. And as we broke that down, the conclusion that we came to and why we, I mean I, because like I couldn't hear you, I was just in this little closet thinking by myself. The conclusion that I came to is that the parable of the Wheat and the Weeds is anticipating the question of, well, is the Kingdom going to take over the whole world? Will there still be people who don't sign up? What happens to the people who disagree? Should Kingdom people go and just wreck them, throw them in jails, kill them, things like that? And the parable goes on to conclude, no, God will sort everything out later. Whereas the parable of the Net seems to be anticipating a different question about how the Kingdom will unfold. That question being, hey, well, what about the stupid stuff that goes on in church? And you got a handful of people and they all are flying the Kingdom banner and some of them are just like, they're great. They love their enemies and they give away what they've been given and they forgive and they're awesome. But then some other people are murderous and weird, but they're all under the same banner. Is that going to get sorted out later as well? What about polluted, gross, weird stuff in church and in the Kingdom? So even though the parable of the Net and the parable of the Wheat and the Weeds are different in that they are responding to two separate anticipated questions, they do have in common a reckoning at the end where God who is the only one who's equipped to judge and sort things out truly looks at the situation and he, not the Kingdom citizens, he does the final sorting out of what goes where, which as I've mentioned for every day for like a week, that's incredibly pressure relieving for the Kingdom citizen and it's in keeping with the overt theological teaching of the Sermon on the Mountain Matthew chapter seven. When Jesus says, don't judge or you two will be judged and the indication there is, hey, you don't have to bear the burden of judging. You're not equipped to do it. You're going to screw it up. Don't worry about it. You're going to be me because I'm God and stuff and you can just be Kingdom citizens and you don't have to hassle with being the final authority on what to do with people who you imagine to be right or wrong. But back to the thing here that they all have in common, which is the idea of a reckoning at the end where God sorts and God judges. In the case of the parable of the Net, Matthew 1347 through whatever 50, it goes like this. Once again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. They sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but they threw the bat away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. I want to zoom in on that last phrase about fiery furnaces and weeping and gnashing of teeth. It's not that hard to picture what is meant by fiery furnace. It looks like there is a destructive element to that. Some people look at any kind of reference to the fiery demise of those who are objects of God's judgment in the Bible and they say, well, what does fire do? Consumes it burns something up and destroys it. Logs don't burn forever. Newspapers don't burn forever. There's an annihilative quality to fuel for fire. It goes away and is consumed. Some people look at this and say, yes, God is right to be a God of judgment, though that is a scary idea. His judgments definitionally must be correct. When he does that, people are consigned to destruction and that is just the end of their whole. This position is called annihilationism. Other people imagine that there's not even a moment of destruction that judgment just occurs and then death is just the end and there's nothing. No one ever knows that they got judged or condemned by the eternal God. It just goes away. There are other people who believe that the punishment of God, the justice of God, is carried out against those who are dead in their sin and outside of Christ. So their sins are not forgiven or resolved by Christ. In other words, that individual has to bear the burden for the consequences spiritually of their own sin and then what happens here is an eternal conscious punishment, which is a horrifying idea, but the power and authority and judgment of God is a horrifying idea in general. In this conversation, we're not going to be sorting out which one of these positions makes the most sense. It supposes another position, which would just be universalism. There is no hell. There is no judgment. I don't know what people who hold that position do with passages like this. Maybe they imagine it means that just the ideas and the notions of the badness and the bad acts are gathered up and consigned to the fire. I don't know. I should have researched that better. I'm not sure. But what it looks like is happening here is there is some awareness on the part of those who are judged and found wanting in the ultimate reckoning by God and that they end up on the outside of the kingdom looking in and that it's a really bad outcome and that in this moment of awareness, it's terrifying and there's agony and pain and sadness over it. Now, this passage doesn't clarify how long that lasts, so it doesn't settle the previous debate that I just introduced. Now, I've dug around a little bit outside the Bible, the New Testament for this expression, weeping and gnashing of teeth. A lot of times when we find these little turns of phrases, we discover that it's borrowed from some cultural norm or some expression from politics or sports or philosophy or literature that Jesus is drawing on that everybody would get in the same way that if I throw out the phrase, my empire of dirt and you're familiar with Nine-inch nails or Johnny Cash, that conjures a ton of meaning with only my empire of dirt. Four quick little words. If you don't know what song I'm talking about and you hear the phrase, my empire of dirt, you can kind of do the math on what that means and you're not totally on the outside if you don't know the expression. Usually, you see something like weeping or gnashing of teeth, it's being drawn from maybe some other source and it's a turn of a phrase that enhances the meaning for the original audience and we have to work a little bit harder to put ourselves in their shoes to get the full meaning. But I haven't found that here. Maybe it does exist and I was just digging in the wrong places. The only other place where I find the expression weeping and gnashing of teeth is actually in the Old Testament. We see that expression used in Job as Job's buddies are irritated and agitated. We see it in Psalm 35, Psalm 37, Psalm 112. Why am I just reciting this to you? I mean, it's not like I'm some Bible genius. I just googled this. It's not that hard. I can just read it to you. Yes, I'm buying time. Psalm 35, 16. And it's a Bible show. Read the Bible. What you're doing with it. And here we go. Like the ungodly, they maliciously mocked. They gnashed their teeth at me. This is a Psalm of David that is referencing stuff that looks pretty messianic. So it's maybe talking about the enemies of the Messiah simultaneously with talking about the enemies of David, Psalm 37, 12. Sounds similar. This is David again, the wicked plot against the righteous and to gnash their teeth at them. And gnashing of teeth there doesn't sound like Marge Simpson irritation. It sounds like an act of aggression or threat, like how an animal bears its teeth, maybe a wolf bears its teeth and growls and grinds them together. I don't know. Like I said, I don't know the exact definition and that's on purpose to make our time together more fun. Psalm 112, 10. The wicked man will see and to be vexed, he will gnash his teeth and waste away. The longings of the wicked will come to nothing. Notations 216, all your enemies open their mouths wide against you. They scoff and gnash their teeth and say, we have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for. We have lived to see it. Okay. So the Old Testament stuff makes gnashing of teeth sound like irritation, frustration, tension in personal agony, but maybe also anger and pent up violent rage. In Acts chapter seven, when Stephen is before the Sanhedrin and he's giving his speech, they get mad about how the speech is going and there's teeth gnashing at him and that ends in a shocking extrajudicial murder of Stephen. So maybe that helps flesh out our picture of what teeth gnashing is. It's a little bit of Bible context from outside of Matthew on that particularly interesting turn of a phrase, but Jesus has used the phrase as well. Right. Chapter eight verse 12. Yeah, here we go. I'll pick it up in verse 10. So this is right after the Sermon on the Mount when Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, oh, this is after the healing of the Centurion servant and Capernaum. I tell you the truth. I've not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and west and will take their places of the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. So this doesn't as much suggest violence as it does the personal agony of knowing that you missed out on something. And then the exact same phrase occurs again in Matthew chapter 13 in the explanation of the parable of the wheat and the weeds that we just covered. They will throw them in the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And there's the verse we're looking at today at the conclusion of the parable of the net and throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. So what we can definitely take from this is whether we're talking about the reckoning of God's judgment with the larger world or the reckoning of God's judgment on those falsely flying his flag, either way it ends in the same thing. There's a fiery furnace and weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of which sounds really bad. Then Matthew 22, 11, 12 and 13, that's a parable we'll get to later about a king who put together a banquet and then nobody wanted to show up for it. Then the king told the attendant, tie him hand and foot and throw him outside into the darkness where there will be, you know, it's coming now. Wiping and gnashing of teeth, chapter 24, right at the end of the chapter, Jesus is talking about the person who follows him and serves him rightly. And then at the very end he talks about those who get it wrong. This is a sign to a place where the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And then again, a page later in chapter 25 at the end of the parable about the talents where everybody gets given so much to invest and one of them does a terrible job. It says, and throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And on that note, it's time for the abrupt pause things that I do from time to time. We are getting a little bit long here and I want to keep digging in deeper to this. So we're just going to spread this conversation out over this episode and the next episode. We'll just pick up right where we left off, manana and keep going with this line of thought. Hey, gigantic.
