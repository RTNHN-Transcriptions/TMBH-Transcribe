"transcription_data": {"text": " the and look it's things that we've all had falling out to the reality is we've all had falling out because people we do dumb stuff for other times we don't do anything dumb at all just somebody else is being idiots their turn on that cycle but stuff breaks relationally and I think as you age you get a few miles on the tires the those broken relationships become one of the things that really nags at you and doesn't feel good but I've been watching this show lately that I would say the themes have a lot to do with accountability and forgiveness and it's very refreshing as opposed to just unending outrage which is the spirit of the day right now is no forgiveness ever for anything that is expedient for me to not forgive you for at any point in history it's just yeah I'm gonna get all worked up it's the bastardization of human relationships the weaponization of withholding forgiveness for the advancement of political and social power I just I don't like us very much right now for that reason it's gross the thing that I've found humanly to be the most life giving in all of my relationships is accountability and forgiveness the part where you realize you screwed up and then the other party honors the fact that you realize you screwed up to how growth happens is how change happens it's how any chance of a long term honest sustainable relationship with another flawed human being happens and I'm preaching a little bit but we wouldn't stupid stuff right now we're tinkering with the thing that gives us any chance of being human beings and knowing and being known and experiencing love so I don't like unforgiveness culture and I love forgiveness and forgiveness with accountability and so I'm watching the show lately where that's a big recurring theme it's so refreshing it's so much fun but over the course of our lives we have relationships that break real ugly and then we have relationships that break but we're not done here we know there's a way to move this thing forward there's a way to patch this thing up and that would seem to be the kind of thing that we're looking at here in Matthew chapter 26 because this is a bad falling out that Jesus is predicting here I mean like stab in the back horrible bad falling out but then I mean just you know half a sentence later it resolves with the indication that we're not done here relation like I'm just reset it Matthew 26 Jesus been telling his disciples I'm gonna get killed by the religious leaders come back to life this is the way things have to be and it's like 10 chapters he's been saying that stuff Peter's been fighting him the whole way Jesus called him Satan at one point for fighting him on this point Peter no this has to happen this is how it's going to go down gradually we see the behavior the disciples indicate that they're coming around to realizing now that this really is what's going to happen is what has to happen they accept it even if they don't totally get it they got their last supper thing betrayal is a big theme throughout the last supper sequence in Matthew chapter 26 but also even though the meal is punctuated by predictions of betrayal it's also still a meal meaning the rather than storming out after saying like hey you know one of all is you're gonna betray me you're gonna hand me over is gonna be horrible like Jesus stays in the room he doesn't stomp out or slam a door make some dramatic point or go make passive aggressive Facebook posts like he still shares the meal with everybody then just in case you're thinking like well maybe he just kind of forgot and just said some stuff about how relationships can be was just musing again a little bit no no no like at the end it's the same thing it's like no this this very night you will fall away on account of me for it is written and this is verse 31 here for it's written Zachariah 13 I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered and then verse 32 get this but after I have risen I will go ahead of you into Galilee isn't it interesting here that despite predictions of dire betrayal like the deepest most vile betrayal going from the hyper trusted relationship that Jesus has enjoyed with these men enough to the point where he could even serve as the father of this new family of faith symbolically this meal of the Passover that they're sharing effectively as a family that we could go from that to somebody here's going to sell me out to death and then just in case you thought that was the only betrayal Jesus also gives the nod to know like literally every one of you the ones who don't sell me out to death you're still going to desert me when the going gets the slightest bit difficult here you are all going to bail and I am going to face this thing alone and what is this thing again he's been very very clear about what it is he's going to die and so you would think that the next normal natural move would be to just say and you guys are toxic and I just can't be in this environment anymore I'm done stomp stomp stomp tweet it and put it on Facebook to make sure everyone knows how wronged and violated you were you can get every single one of those poor suffering I was wronged victim points maybe people will start to go fund me for you and give you a bunch of money because your feelings got hurt because other people were jerks we don't really need to hear their side of anything like just throw a gigantic fit make a huge scene about it and receive consolation from people who like to feel morally superior as well and you're on with your day Jesus doesn't do that I mean that's pretty common now that's that's our play something goes wrong like kind of just won the lottery here but Jesus doesn't do that instead he's like okay yeah y'all are going to betray me it's going to be a horrible and worse thing you ever did ever anyways when I'm done being dead I'll just see you guys up in Galilee what yeah the relationship's not broken if you think about it the whole point of him dying is to it fully initiate and certify this new family of faith anyway it's to solidify the whole thing it's to establish this new kingdom so it's completely different than once again the values of the world the values of how we do things world kingdom says you wronged me for the last time this environment is toxic and I'm mad and kingdom kingdom values at least how Jesus plays it out is yeah we still got miles to go despite the fact that you're going to drop the ball and hurt me right here so when he says but after I've risen I'll go ahead of you into Galilee what he's signaling is you're going to wrong me I know you're going to wrong me I know exactly what you're doing I know exactly what's wrong with you I knew that when I invited you and I signed up for this we're going to go back to the place that is stable that is predictable where it all started where we're all at home and when I have risen I will be there make sure you're there too will straighten everything out that you're about to get wrong and then we'll talk about how we're going to move forward that I don't think is too bold a paraphrase because you can just look back at Matthew chapter 10 and see that he indicated that there would be a next thing there'd be a next phase in their big open world quest and if Jesus dies and there is no next phase then I guess he was messing around back there in 10 but instead this remark in Matthew 26 32 about after I've risen I'll go ahead of you into Galilee to me seems like an extension of what he's been saying to them all along would be the timetable and the plan here most of all I'm just in awe of Jesus behavior and his capacity to endure the consequences of other people's screw ups and low character moves his capacity for forgiveness and grace is exemplary it's next level it's inspiring it's not what I do but it's what I aspire to do the way this plays out is like Jesus is completely forfeiting his right to revenge against his friends who let him down instead he's clearly intending to forgive to move forward and this is shrewd there's a lot of shrewdness language throughout Jesus words and throughout the Bible and it doesn't quite get talked about as much because it just doesn't seem like dough-eyed to Jesus in terms of an attribute but it very much is the shrewdness of his investment here too is that he's put a ton of time into these guys these are the dudes this is who he called this is who he's rolling with these are the guys who are going to go and be the initial crowd that spreads the message and sets the whole kingdom thing up they're taking the baton they are responsible in many ways for the next phase like what are you going to do just burn it because they screwed you over during an important time well no in Jesus wisdom and shrewdness he's like hey I picked flawed people to be a part of my thing they're going to get it wrong at times but I'm not going to burn the relationship I'm not going to burn the investment these guys aren't ruined they're not shot they still have a ton to contribute here and I think that is so exemplary as well man relationships are hard earned that time that we have in the rear view mirror with people that is not replaceable this little remark from Jesus is very moving to me I think I could go on and on about it for a super long time but the bottom line is wow what a astonishing example of forgiveness and not making a giant thing of it right now and I on the prize goodness Jesus is locked in and he's not going to sit here and get bogged down on the mistakes he knew all along these guys we're going to make he's going to walk through the things he has to walk through which are very difficult and be very frank and very direct about what the next step is going to be for all of them you're going to betray me that's going to be a bummer alright then I'll see you in Galilee after amazing some of you support this program at patreon.com slash the tmbh podcast that's why it exists we've run a couple of little ads here and there and I might do it again if I've got just exactly the right thing that I think will definitely make your life better but I say no to pretty much everything that comes my way because I'm not 100% sure it'll make your life better so in light of that it means this whole thing gets to exist and gets to happen because some of you decided to support it and that is not lost on me I'm so dang grateful thank you for doing that thank you to those of you who do not support the program because you don't have to it's free it'll always be free that's part of the fun alright we'll look at how Peter pushes back on Jesus remarks instead of just receiving the nice thing he just said next time around a mat is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast let's do this again so", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": " the", "tokens": [262],
