It was a really, really nice girl. She didn't turn out to be my wife, which is no indictment on her. I mean, why do you date somebody in high school? Is to figure out who you are and what kind of person you want to be in a relationship and what kind of person you want to be maybe married to someday. But it was a really good experience. We dated for a couple of years and I really don't have a lot of complaints. But there was one thing that stood out and that was that she would constantly ask me if I got quiet for even like two seconds. She'd be like, what are you thinking? And I don't think that was born out of insecurity. I think it was just born out of a genuine curiosity because we liked each other and it was a nice time being boyfriend and girlfriend in high school. And I think she cared about me and probably just wanted to know what I was thinking. But here's my secret. Sometimes I wasn't thinking anything at all. I was just sitting there, spacing off. And then when I got asked to say what I was thinking about, it freaked me out because I got nothing. And I felt like I needed to make crap up and be like, oh, just how pretty you are. But really I was thinking about literally nothing whatsoever. Again, I think that's born out of somebody just caring about another person and really being interested in what's going on inside their head. Likewise, I think everybody who has any sense of belief in God or even some greater power at times is going to ask that question, what are you thinking? God, what are you doing here? What is the plan? What's next? And one of the beauties of Matthew chapter 17, I think, is for just a minute here, we get a really clear look not just physically at Jesus in his glory, but also we get a pretty clear look at what's going on inside the mind of God because he spells it right out. And so that's all I really want to look at today is a couple of things that we learn about what God is thinking in this passage. So Matthew chapter 17 is a transfiguration. And this has Peter and James and John, the brother of James being led up to a high mountain by Jesus just by themselves. And then after that verse two, it says, there he, Jesus was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun and his clothes became as wide as the light and just then appeared before them, Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, Lord, it's good for us to be here. If you wish, I'll put up three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, one for Elijah. This is the part where we start to get a look inside the mind of God. While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them and a voice from the cloud said, this is my son whom I love with him. I am well pleased. Listen to him. Now what God means exactly by this, I suppose has a little bit to do with what prompted him to say this stuff. So we'll break that down in a second. But on the surface, we can clearly determine a few things from what God is saying here. Jesus is my son. So Peter just got done saying that you are the Christ, the son of the living God in chapter 16. And now in chapter 17, it isn't just Jesus who's like, right on Peter, you got that one right. It is God who reiterates this. This is my son that I suppose a natural next question one could ask would he be like, how's it going between the two of you? Are you tight? Has it been a little bit tense? Did he go through a weird teenage rebellious stage? Whom I love? Oh, okay. And with him, I am well pleased. All right. So now we know more about the mind of God as it pertains to Jesus. That's my son. I love him. He's doing exactly the stuff that I want him to do. So in other words, if you are a fan of me, God, the maker and sustainer of all of existence and all things, then you should be a fan of him because I am a fan of him. And then he goes on to say, listen to him. Now, again, I mentioned earlier that this is an echo of the business at the end of chapter three, where Jesus gets baptized. Says, as soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. And at that moment, heaven was opened and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, this is my son, whom I love with him. I am well pleased. But he doesn't say the last thing at the baptism that he does here at the transfiguration. God adds, listen to him. Now in terms of our question for the day, which is, what are you thinking about God? This is pretty self explanatory, self contained without any context as we just broke down. But if we treat this as somehow a response to what Peter just did or suggested, then I think it reads a little bit differently. You'll notice that Peter's suggestion was to throw together three shelters for three guys. So, oh man, you guys are huge names. Well, I would even be prepared paraphrases mine here toward Peter to put Jesus on the same level as Moses and Elijah. Now, for you and me as Christians after the fact, it's like, well, Jesus is the most important religious person of all religions ever in terms of historical influence, not just even Christianity. So yeah, of course, Jesus ranks at the very, very top of the religion that has his name on it. I mean, come on, how hard is this? But think about Peter's world, the rock stars were Moses and Elijah. And what a huge jump this would be. I mean, Peter probably felt like I am prepared to make you quite the offer. I am prepared to think of you as being on par with these other two guys. Let's make a shelter for everybody. Jesus, you are right up there. I don't think it's a stretch at all to read it that way, which is really nice. And that's really good. But it's also really insufficient. Remember, what is Matthew trying to accomplish with this book? He's trying to convince the reader that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God, the One who we've all been waiting for, the One who is the completion of all of the stuff in the Old Testament. He's trying to convince us that Jesus is the newer and greater Moses, making a new family of faith that transcends ethnic boundaries. He is the go between God and man. He's the perfect mediator between the two. He's the ultimate and complete Word of God, the Word of God in the flesh, far more than any other prophet who relayed stuff from God in the past. So no, Matthew is trying to convince us that Jesus is not on par with Moses and Elijah and all the stuff in the Old Testament. He's also not eliminating all of that. He's the completion of it. He's where the whole thing was always headed. It's understandable that Peter would not fully grasp those implications yet. It's like this, when you are a sports fan and you've got the rock stars, the legends, the Hall of Famers, the ones who have the gold sculptures of them in Cooperstown, you think about their numbers and their exploits and the legend surrounding them, they seem like they're in a different class than people today. And then you just Buffalo Wild Wings one day and they throw up Mike Trout's career stats and you kind of do a double take at that and you're like, whoa, Mike Trout is really, really, really all time good at baseball. Oh, weird. This is hard for me to think of a guy who's younger than me as being in the same conversation as like the all time legends. So I get the psychological hurdle that Peter and James and John are having to overcome here, but God seems to have had enough of that psychological hurdle and he will not stand by and quietly abide the person who is going to be the torch bearer for Christianity and the church moving forward, putting Jesus on the same plane as Elijah and Moses. Uh, uh, uh, so you'll notice that as we learn the mind of God here in verse five, God doesn't come along and be like, those are Moses and Elijah who are really good, definitely listen to them, but also listen to my son. He doesn't even mention Moses and Elijah. Yeah, like whatever. Those were part of what I used to get things where they are now. No, but Jesus is different. Listen to him. Now, I don't think this can be entirely divorced from what happened earlier in chapter 16 when we've got the showdown with the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Uh, again, where they demand a miraculous sign and Jesus says all the stuff about red sky at night, sailors delight, et cetera. And then the disciples as they leave town or upset because they think Jesus is mad at them because they forgot sandwiches and Jesus is like, no, it's not about the sandwiches. It's about be on your guard against the yeast, the sandwiches, so to speak, of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. So there really is a big stake in the ground that has been planted in chapter 16 that says, Jesus is the real authority. These people claiming to be representatives of Moses and Elijah and the torchbearers of all that has happened and is being carried forward from the Old Testament. They just ain't. So don't listen to them. In fact, be on your guard against them. So now it sounds like what's happening here, if we want to know the mind of God is that he's just confirming the two big highlights of chapter 16. Highlight number one, Jesus says, be on your guard against their yeast. They're not trustworthy. Watch out for these religious leaders and the long comes God. And he's like, yeah, listen to Jesus. And then the second thing is Peter's confession and the long comes God. And he's like, yeah, just once again, that is my son, whom I love. And with him, I am well pleased. And so we get all of that, but there's one more thing floating around back there that I think this voice of God is speaking to fresh in our minds coming off of chapter 16 is Jesus saying, I'm going to go to Jerusalem and I'm going to die and I'm going to be raised back to life. And Peter being like, no, I will fight you over that right now. Never is that going to happen on my watch. And that same well intentioned, but not getting it. And this is on display in the remarks Peter just made about making little equal shelters for everybody to be celebrated equally. And so it seems like here is the authoritative voice of God speaking. I mean, to whom does he need to say this to Moses and Elijah? I mean, God isn't talking to them. Moses and Elijah know what the deal is. Is he talking to Jesus? Like Jesus probably is already pretty clear on his patronage and what his job is here. No, he's clearly talking to three guys. Peter, James and John and James and John didn't do anything. So I think the best way to read this is that God is talking to Peter enough with your dumb shelters. Just, this is my son. Listen to him. And then I picture like this space explosion pulse of energy that doesn't describe anything like that at all. That just levels everybody with the awesomeness of God and they fall face down on the ground and they're terrified. So Peter's gone from like, let's build huts to completely terrified lay on the ground in the fetal position. And then Jesus comes and touches him. He says, get up. Don't be afraid. And they look up and everybody's gone except for Jesus. Hey, some of you have gone to the T.M. BH.com and thumbed through everything enough to figure out that there's a little tab there that says support. I know pretty much everything we do here is through Patreon, which by the way, after a chaotic month, I've got the last little round of field guide notebooks set to mail out to the patrons. So thanks for your patience with me. That's coming. But some of you have gone over the website and have figured out that we set up a little thing where you can do a one time kick in if you want to. And I've noticed an anomaly uptick in that regard of late. And anytime you do that, I try to shoot you a note back through PayPal to say thanks. I don't get responses. So I don't know if those go through. So hey, if you didn't hear it from me before, those of you who've kicked in to support the program like that, thank you. You are awesome. And it's why I'm able to make this a thing that I do every day. So all of you, thank you so much for supporting the program and those of you who don't. That's cool too. Thank you for being here and talking about this stuff. I'm going to tap out right there. I'm Matt.
