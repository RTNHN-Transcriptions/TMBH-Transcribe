He did a good job with his history, had a lot to say about society. He got into Mr. Podcaster mode, and now he got a extra bang along, yeah, but so, 10 minute Bible hour podcast. All right, we got a little bit of an inside baseball conversation that we're going to have here. And it occurs to me that even the term inside baseball is increasingly becoming inside baseball. You know this term, right? It's an old term that means conversations about topics that are kind of narrow, and unless you're in it, you might not know the jargon or the dance steps of a given topic, a given subculture. This is one of those because I want to talk about Christian higher education in the United States and Canada. And if you're going like, oh, I'm here for just more of the Bible stuff, I don't worry, this is all going to tie in to Nia Maya 10 here in just a minute. Over the last few hundred years, a couple hundred years specifically, it seems like every Christian denomination in my country eventually made a little liberal arts college. Now, some of these say liberal arts, but really they're more of Bible college that sort of teaches the specific theology of a given expression of Christianity, and those can be great. Not a good things come out of that. But then some other ones, when they say liberal arts college, what they mean is, you know, like the academic traditions of your where you've got a whole bunch of different topics that you can go and study, and you just, I mean, it's college, just whatever you think of as college, it's college, right? And I went to one of those. My undergraduate experience happened at Trinity College, or it became Trinity International University. I always thought that name was a little bit goofy, but whatever. Trinity was on the north shore of Chicago, so in the super ritzy northern suburbs, basically the same place that Ferris Bueller was from. And so it was kind of a wild experience to be there and be dirt, poor. I mean, nothing is a freshman in college. And my neighbors are Mike Ditka and Michael Jordan and Scotty Pippen and Mr. T and Mandy Patinkin. That's the guy who was hunting the six-fingered man in the Princess Bride. And how do I know all these people live there? Because eventually I got a job at Pizza Hut and I delivered them all pizza. So just crazy being this little poor college student enclave in the middle of this really fancy, wealthy part of the world. But the experience was really good. I think my professors were great and you could go there and you could study a whole variety of topics. And I think they were all very good at the disciplines they taught, but also all of the faculty there really put a lot of emphasis on integrated thought, thinking Christianly about whatever subject you were looking at. There was also a tremendous amount of emphasis on classical thought, which I think is good. I think it breeds humility instead of imagining that we're the smartest generation ever. It breeds humility to spend a huge amount of your educational process reading the greatest minds of the past. Because hopefully in doing so, if you're paying attention, I wish I'd paid attention better, you're not just learning what they discovered and what they said, you're learning their thought processes. You're being trained to imitate the processes of the most successful, most effective thinkers and communicators and explorers of all time. So I believe in what I got. It was cool and I met my wife on my first day in my first class, Honors Philosophy, and that's worked out really well. So that was pretty cool too. My school, like so many of these little liberal arts schools around the United States and Canada has a seminary attached to it and it is associated with a denomination, an expression of Christian faith. In this case, it's associated with the Evangelical Free Church of America, which is like a Lutheran free church kind of thing where they split off from the state church of Norway and Sweden. So those immigrants migrated to Missouri and to Minnesota. In the late 1800s, there was a big boom. It's why the Minnesota Vikings are the Vikings because that's where everybody migrated from at that time. And they eventually became the Evangelical Free Church of America and Trinity eventually became their college. Again, tons and tons of denominations have little schools with seminaries attached just like this. A seminary is where you go to get trained to either be a clergy person, a pastor, a priest, whatever, or to do academic Bible scholarship kind of stuff. Well, here's a crazy thing. My college this year went away. It's gone. I have a zombie alma mater. I get my transcripts, I guess. If I need them now from some other institution, it doesn't exist. The campus, all of it, I went and looked at it. They were like tumbleweeds and stuff, maybe not literally, but almost. It's pretty wild to see this place. It was formative for so many people go away. And I think it's okay for me to use the adjective or adverb sadly. And when I talk about this, but sadly, the same thing is happening to a whole bunch of schools like this. Now, why? Okay, COVID maybe. I don't know. I forget that COVID was just this gigantic thing in other parts of the world because we didn't really do it in western South Dakota and things went really frankly pretty well. I'm trying not to offer political commentary there, but I kind of am offering the political commentary that I don't agree with the mediation approach that was taken by most of the world. And I particularly don't agree that we were not allowed to even have a conversation about what would be the best way to help people and get through it. So yes, I guess that was a bit of political commentary, but I'm going to stop with that right now only to say, hey, people did what they did. Different communities attacked it the way they attacked it, but there were pretty serious consequences for a whole lot of businesses and institutions in places that attacked it with more strict mitigation policies than the places that sort of just let the thing play out. But I think that's the cheap explanation. I think the bigger thing that is happening there is we just went through a crazy moment in the history of faith in the western world. And what was this crazy moment? Well, I think it's a crisis of the Internet. Somewhere around the year 2000 to 2005, you and I, if you're listening to this, you're probably old enough to have been alive for that. Maybe you're just a bit younger, but within easy, smooth living memory of you and I, one of the five or six great shifts in the history of thought in the history of the world just occurred. The shockwaves are still running through us constantly. It feels like this is the new normal, but it's not this degree of dynamism and change and transformation is weird. We all lived in relatively small little bubbles up until the early 2000s. You might be like, well, yeah, what about magazines and TV and all of that stuff? Well, sure. But even the age of mass broadcast media was only a couple of generations long. And even then, if you grew up in the 80s, 90s or even 2000s, you grew up where you grew up. You were defined by the people in your life, the people around you, your church, your school, your teams, whatever. But after the age of my space, and I would say my space, not Facebook, the world dramatically changed because we no longer found our identity in a local physical community, our values, our ideas, our knowledge, our entertainment was being shaped in little virtual enclaves with other actual human beings, but not with other actual human beings that we saw and interacted with in all the ways that make a community robust and functional. So some dysfunction got introduced because nobody on this planet knew how to do life and social existence in that way. I still don't think we know how to do it very well in that way. Also, there was a sudden deprivation of being with other people in the community and receiving the give and take and feedback and push back and correctives, the social formatives that you get. But also our ideas all simultaneously got put to the test in a way that we were not ready for, particularly, and for the purposes of our conversation, religious ideas. I mean, for just about everybody, if you got raised in the context of church, you got raised in one context. I knew like five Catholics when I was a kid, and I was just more or less told they're bad and they're wrong about things. And I get it, Catholics everywhere were being told the same thing about me. It's just how you did things back then to kind of prop up the home team and like, just don't even worry about those other people. They're just, I guess they're just eluded, crazy or low character. Well, then the internet happened and I met all these people and I was like, oh, I actually kind of like you and I respect your conviction. And oh, all these people who really love God and are excited about the Bible and are taking this really seriously and have deep convictions, they're kind of like me. They just seem to have arrived at some different conclusions. And I think as a whole bunch of people went through that at once, it really did create a crisis. I also think that as some of the religious fundamentalism of the 80s and 90s that could work in little enclaves got exposed to the bright lights of the internet. It didn't hold up as well. And there was sort of a mad at my dad culture-wide reaction against that that caused sort of a new self-destructive secular fun. That is now petering out. And to me, that's pretty much what the last 20 years have been. One of the weirdest intellectual moments in the history of time. Little dashes of idiocracy sprinkled in there, but also some brilliant things happening. Terrible, terrible public art being made during this time. But also in little enclaves here and there, brilliant public art being made in this time. It's a very, very strange moment where science and faith are oddly combatively pitted against each other. Political division, very, very strange. Look, colleges like mine and seminaries have not done well during that time. They haven't had a sense of how to articulate what it is that they offer and why it would make sense to send your high school graduate to that kind of a college. The messaging has been awful. And I don't think it's just because they have bad people in their marketing department. It's because I don't think they really knew what their role was during this time. Maybe some institutions more than others. Well, whether you agree with my assessment or not, my college failed. And it's gone. And that's weird for me. And I'm surprised at how bothered and frustrated I am by that. Also, I think I'm gradually coming around to just accepting the reality of the moment. Mine was one that I guess just wasn't built to survive those 20 years of instability. Maybe if it could have held out for another year or two as things are clearly starting to turn the corner, it would be in better shape now. But it is what it is. Others have fared better. The seminary at my college, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, which is where I got my seminary degree, is holding up better than the college. It's still in place. I've even heard some encouraging reports about where that might be headed. Maybe it's on the rebound. But like all seminaries or almost all seminaries for the last 20 years, the trend has been downward. Ministries turned very difficult. It went from an honored position in the community to kind of a thankless job where you receive a lot of friendly fire. And it can be very difficult to serve a congregation. I will say the churches that I've been a part of are an exception to that. I had really great experiences. I mean, at times a little exhausting, but I guess I was kind of lucky in terms of what I got to experience in church. But I've got eyes. I can see what's going on. It's a tough time to be a pastor. And so you add all of that up. And what has been happening is we've seen a serious decline in seminary enrollment over the last 20 years across the spectrum of all different types of Christian convictions. It's an epidemic. It's a problem. Any of you have been on a search committee, you know, dang, it was really hard to find anybody. Or maybe you're on a search committee right now at a church and you're trying to find somebody. And you're discovering that it's a very challenging thing. Oh, by the way, is this a very long episode? Yes, it is. But I'm just going to see this one all the way through. It's a little different. And I'm setting up a whole thing that we got to talk about here in Nehemiah chapter 10. In a way, it's kind of like the bees thing from a while back where they kept saying like, they don't have any bees. There are fewer honeybees. You need the bees to pollinate stuff. And the people who knew about this kind of thing with really no partisan agenda or anything. We're like, hey, it's weird that there aren't as many bees. Something's up. The lack of bees might be sort of a canary in the coal mine situation. Or maybe something's going wrong. And maybe we need to change some stuff so we have bees when you want the bees. The same kind of thing is happening for people who watch the church. And I'm like, hey, there's a whole bunch of pastors who were trained in the 70s, 80s, 90s, even 2000s. And they're still working and serving congregations and articulating the values of the kingdom of Christ. And they're pretty well equipped to teach the Bible. And they're doing a really good job. But for each one who moves on to retirement or leaves the ministry, that's been an epidemic as well. People who are trained for this leaving ministry altogether to go and do other stuff. For each one that leaves, there's only like half a one to replace them. I'm kind of making up a ratio, but I don't think it's too far-fetched. And so the idea is that unless something changes, we're simply going to run out of people to do the priestly duties, the pastoral duties that are needed to make churches happen. Now, I know there's some of you listening who have either had a rough church situation or no church situation. Maybe you look at that and go, I don't know, would that be so bad? That church wasn't great for me. Or maybe there are others of you who are like, what do pastors even do? I mean, they get paid a decent living wage to what, talk for 35 minutes a week? That doesn't seem like much of a job at all. And I'm not even going to criticize you for seeing it that way. I mean, if you're outside looking in, it might look like that. But also I'm going to stick up for the people who do this for a living. Oh, my friends, it is so much more than that. It is a job that requires a magnificent level of training to do well. But you don't get the prestige of being some sort of public academic or author or anything like that. You're in the trenches with people on their great days, sure. But also you're there for everybody's worst thing. You've got to figure out how to have a social and even spiritual, biblical, communicating touch that is always alert, always present, always on, for people, not just for their worst day because like they're acting like a jerk. I mean, that happens too. If you're in that role, you'll catch people on their meanest, jerkiest. I'm having a tough time right now day. But also you're going to be there for people's darkest tragedies and deepest hurt. You're going to consume a lot of the poison of the human experience for your congregation. And right now, in the last 20 years, people are trying to compensate for the decline in church with therapy. And God bless therapists. I'm grateful for what they do, but it is not the same. The pastor's role is much more complex. It's much more difficult. And it encompasses some of what a therapist does, but it is so much more. And if you don't know that and you haven't been around that, no hard feelings is okay. I understand how that wouldn't be immediately obvious to an outsider. But look, even if you're somebody who's like, I don't like organized religion, I don't trust church. Okay, cool. Like I get it. That's a conversation we could definitely have. But what we have to admit is people have thought that was a good idea for all of human history. People have innately desired connection with their maker and connection with other people seeking connection with their maker. People have innately desired some sort of narrative or mechanism that transcends this world that accounts for human suffering and human failure and regret. Some sort of mechanism for atonement, a narrative that is more than just sort of a pop culture, self affirming notion of forgiveness, but one that actually has a teeth and makes you feel like there actually might be atonement. That there might be purpose after failure and screwing things up. It's not just in Christianity. People everywhere on planet earth have wanted that. And sure, priestly classes have been exploitative at times and it's gotten weird and out of balance because there is power to be had and abused if people want to do it. But there's so much good and right that has come out of the historic Christian or Judeo-Christian role of priest and minister as well. And people rightly want it. They rightly yearn for what the church does, what the community of faith does. So it's kind of a, hey, where did all the pollinating honeybees go kind of crisis that we've been quietly observing here over the last 20 years as these numbers have declined as pretty much every demographic has taken a downward turn in terms of belief or at least until as I'm recording this a couple of years ago. That's where it gets interesting. This downward turn I'm talking about is in the West, but globally through this whole time and since I mean just for ages, the global church has been on the rise. Belief in Jesus of Nazareth has not slowed down on the rise on the rise on the rise. But it's in the West that we've seen these numbers in decline for a while or at least until the last couple of years where it's all changing. People aren't just responding to the message of Christ and the values of the kingdom. People across all demographics are responding to it in frankly a pretty traditional way, whether Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican or general Protestant, even a lot of the more recent iterations in terms of just the organization, the paperwork, whatever, the institution. Even a lot of those seem to have a more traditional outlook on what they're doing in terms of worship and communication and even just the expectation on the attendee of the church to know and to grow and to be discipled. And people are hungry for that. So this whole trend that we've been hearing about and repeating for so long, like, oh, belief is on the decline, Christian belief is on the decline in the West, that would seem to be changing. It looks like all of those trend lines have reached the low inflection point and are rebounding. And you've heard forever like, Oh, Gen Z, they're not into God or whatever. Well, apparently that's rebounding as well. And it's not just Christian researchers who are finding this. I'm seeing it across the spectrum. Well, along with that, we're seeing a rebound in seminary attendance. And for the first time, I've been seeing articles here in the last year or so where there's an indication that the decline in seminary enrollment is hitting that low inflection point and rebounding somewhere within a basically year of when I'm recording this. And even though I like to keep episodes evergreen, I am recording this in the summer of 2024, looking at data from the winter of 2023, 2024. For example, right here, I've got the Association of Theological Schools, the Commission on Accrediting. I've got their report on seminary enrollment that dates back to 1990. And the trends have been bad, as I've said, for a really long time, but all of a sudden they're leveling out and 18 different schools that they track are actually experiencing significant enrollment growth over the last five years. This is across degree programs from the professional academic degree, all the way to practical pastoral degrees and everything in between. So this is very interesting that the trend of seminary enrollment that is prepping people for priestly and pastoral roles is following that same belief curve during the era of chaos of the last 20 years. This super dynamic change in how we think about everything as a species, it rattled at all. But these indicators tell me that we are coming out the back end. The secular fundamentalist reaction that came out of this is flagging in all kinds of ways. It's been weighed and found wanting. There isn't life in it. There might be good reforms in there, but as a lifestyle and approach as a pseudo secular religion, people don't seem to be buying it. Any more, where will they turn next? Well, it looks like to faith in God. And here's where I get to the point, right? I went to this college. It's now defunct. That is very sad for me. A lot of other colleges like it are now defunct. A bunch of the attached seminaries that these different denominations put forward are now defunct. I went to St. Louis recently, and there's a huge problem with underfunding and underattendance for Catholic institutions as well. It's not just 200 and 300 year old Protestant institutions that are closing. It's also Catholic institutions that are closing. This was hard on everybody, but as I mentioned, things seem to be changing. Okay, but here's the thing. We're only talking about a 20 year window here in this conversation and that 20 year gap, that 20 year dip has resulted in a huge decrease in the number of people to fill in the number of people. To fill these pastoral and priestly roles. That's kind of a crisis. It's a big deal that people didn't choose that for those 20 years. And it's a big deal that people would seem to be coming back to that and choosing it as what they want to do with their lives again. Now, it only took one generation of not having a plan for Christians in the West. One generation, not even a full generation, 20 years, two decades of not having a plan to see a pastoral priestly person. A pastoral priestly crisis emerge. You have to have a plan to keep moving people through this very complex training that it takes to truly do this kind of work well and truly minister to people. I'm not talking about hand a guy, a microphone who's very charismatic and have him say the same thing four or five times in a row, you know, kind of go to the well sermons like there are guys like that. And I'm really appreciative of those guys. But at some point, this is a life of the mind kind of task where you're dealing with a huge ancient document and a whole bunch of Christian thought that stacks on top of that. It's a hard job. There's a lot that goes into it. I don't think there's any shame or downside to admitting that it takes a decent amount of training to get a person ready to do this well and to contribute over the long haul. And there are people who do really well with very little training and I acknowledge that as well. But historically, this has been a calling that takes a lot of work to do it really, really well. It takes a lot of work on the front end. It's expensive to fund that education. Okay. Longest episode ever. All the way back to Nehemiah chapter 10. There is a provision here that seems way overblown as you're reading through it. You're going through this stuff like we did yesterday about the real time strategy stuff like we have to have wood to offer because sacrifices get burned. What burns would we going to need would so everybody signs up for the Capri Sun little league baseball checklist and like, all right. And you know, the Johnson's we've got the wood for June 15th. That's our wood day. Everybody's got a wood day. It just don't make sense. These provisions. All right. We're all going to have to every year. We're going to have to kick in a little bit of silver to the coffers to make sure that the people are going to be able to do it. And the coffers to make sure that there's enough money to pay the people to do all this stuff. Okay. That's just logical. Okay. They're going to need food for the cafeteria metaphorically speaking for all the people who make the temple go here in ancient Jerusalem. So we all got to bring food from time to time. We all agree to do it. But then you get to this next provision in Nehemiah 10, the ratification of this covenant in 444 BC by the descendants of Abraham who are the ratifying a covenant that is as a long view. How are we going to sustain this? And you get to this next part and you're like, dang, that sounds a little more harsh than wood and crops. It goes like this. Nehemiah 10, 36. As it is also written in the law, we will bring the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, of our herds and of our flocks to the house of our God to the priest ministering there. Okay. All that stuff about firstborn of your livestock. Yeah. Sure. I mean, they're going to need meat. The protein is very important. And also we've got to sacrifice things. I mean, this ancient religion at a sacrificial system. Great. You bring your best thing to God and to the temple. I mean, I love what that communicates, but it's that line. We'll bring the firstborn of our sons. That's tough. Divorced from context. This might sound like some ancient Near Eastern slave cabal. It might sound even almost like child sacrifice or something against the backdrop of modern sensibilities. It sounds like what you're depriving that firstborn son of his God given right to self-determination to figure out what he wants to pursue with his life and who he wants to love and what he wants to live. You can't do that to somebody. The truth is for most of human history with trades and guilds and the way households and societies were structured, there wasn't a ton of picking that happened when you were the firstborn son of a household. You picked up what your family did and you ran with it and you carried the baton and handed it off to your firstborn son. It's why so many of you listening to this have last names that are jobs. The potter, Cooper, Whitman. Nope. That's just white man. That's just literally a description of how my skin looks. Okay. But the first two examples were real good ones. That's how it's been for a long time. It's only very recently that we've thought in terms of this go out into the great, wide, unknown and seek your fortune and your life. And seek your fortune and just do brand new stuff. I kind of like it. I think it's a reasonable way to do things. I think it makes sense in our day and age. But this passage in Nehemiah 10 would not have clanged for the original audience. They would have come across this and been like, well, yeah, obviously. It makes sense just instead of our firstborn sons coming to do our jobs, we're going to our firstborn sons go and be committed to the life of the temple. And they're going to be trained as priests or if they're not from the right family to do that, then they're going to be trained. They're going to be trained as Levites or temple servants. They're going to play some kind of role in making this very big, very expensive, very central formative thing to this people group. Remember this wasn't ancillary. This wasn't like, oh, we go to church for 45 minutes a week and throw a few bucks in the offering plate. This was the center of their civilization as ordained by God through the breaking of the laws of time and space. This was a much huger deal than most people's relationship with church today. And so they would have seen this and been like, well, obviously, yeah, our sons are going to need to do that. And also this provision for your first son is going to serve in the religious life of the community is not new. This wasn't something they made up in Nehemiah chapter 10. Rather, they're harkening back to stuff from the earliest iteration of the covenant and down by God to Moses in Exodus. 13, hang on, I wrote it down. Where's it at? Verse 12, after the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you as he promised on oath to you and your forefathers. This is all from 800 or 1000 years before the stuff we're looking at in Nehemiah. You are to give over to the Lord, the first offspring of every womb, all the first born males of your livestock belong to the Lord. Redeem every first born among your sons. Now, the neighboring people groups who in the covenant Nehemiah 10, the descendants of Abraham just got done saying, we're not going to imitate anymore. We're not going to intermarry with them. We're not going to be like them anymore. These neighboring people groups, they also had a provision for their first born sons, but it wasn't for them to serve in religious roles. It was for them to be burned on a hot, bronze statue of Molech as a child blood offering to their false God. That is one of the vile practices that the Old Testament rails against. We're not talking about child sacrifice here in Nehemiah 10, good heavens. That is the darkest of evil practices, the darkest of litmus tests for a failed society throughout the Bible. No, we're talking about, it said the opposite. We're talking about something that is life-giving. Again, to you and me, this sounds like what the Disney hero or heroine has to overcome because their oppressive backward old style parents want. You're going to work in my inventing shop. But I don't want to be an inventor father. I want to be a dancer. We think of that plot all the time. It's not like that at all to the original audience. They would have thought of this very, very differently. However, as we read on as this provision is touched on a couple more times in Exodus 34 and Numbers 18, we see that there is a provision, if it didn't make sense for a given family to do this, that they could simply pay the equivalent of several years of that temple tax and basically have their son work in a different profession or work in the household profession. Either way, there was either the gift of the first-born son to work and make an honorable profession, a highly enviable profession of working in and around the temple, or you could commit, I think, five shekels was the number. So the equivalent of multiple years of the temple tax, and that would sort of pay or redeem back that son from that particular role if that wasn't what made sense. Verse 15 to Numbers 18, the first offspring of every womb, both man and animal that is offered to the Lord is yours, but you must redeem every first-born son and every first-born male of unclean animals. When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs 20 garas. So five shekels at the time of Nehemiah chapter 10 would be 30 times the annual temple tax, or about two Troy ounces of silver, the equivalent of 60-ish dollars USD today. So it was significantly more than you would pay for just a regular temple tax, but this was the provision that was built in, and this is where the whole thing comes full circle on this mega episode that I know is weird. Thank you for indulging this. Didn't feel like it could be broken up over multiple days. This is where the whole thing comes full circle. This is a significant baked in the societal expectations and the covenant provision to keep the pipeline full of people who could serve in these priestly roles. These people knew and they knew because of a thousand years of history behind them, they learned these lessons that if they didn't make a commitment, if they didn't make a provision for how this would be not just funded, but also how the manpower would be provided to have a priestly class and a temple system, that it wasn't going to happen. It was going to fade. There would be the best of intentions, but if there's nobody who knows how to do the role, or society can't afford to train people to be good at the role, that not just the temple is going to fall into disrepair, but the people are going to fall into disrepair. You need talented, trained, funded people in this role, or the system being outlined with these covenants in Nehemiah 10, it's not going to work. And if they don't make provisions for this and plans for this, if they don't future proof this problem, they're going to be right back where they were at the beginning of Nehemiah chapter 1. When Nehemiah gets the visit and finds out that it isn't just the walls that are in disrepair, but the people are in disarray. The plan here has always been twofold, my friends, as we've worked through as we're in Nehemiah, it's always been rebuild the city and rebuild the people. This is a provision that sounds very weird to modern ears, but to the people who were making this deal, it made perfect sense. This was a provision to solidify the rebuilding of the people so they could keep what they had. And as you and I have just learned over the last two decades, just two measly decades, this is a very fragile thing. And if there isn't a plan, it can quickly start to unravel. Now, mercifully, I don't think it's unraveled for us. Mercifully, I think what happened was maybe some kind of big, weird purge of soft, lazy, bloated institutions. I'm not saying that my alma mater was necessarily one of those. Oh boy, did that sound mean? I'm not bitter or anything. But sometimes there are institutions and there are things that just maybe need to go away. They're not very effective anymore. Sometimes there are ideas that just need to go downstream and they don't work anymore, but nobody will ever divorce themselves from them. It takes a lot of institutional courage to do that. Sometimes things just have to fail so that they can be what they need to be now in the new version of them. That is what I think is happening in the Christian world right now, in the world in general right now. I think we are seeing the beginning of a massive resurgence of faith. And I don't think it's going to look like the 1980s and 1990s. I think it's going to look like a very new and different thing. And honestly, I think you and I are kind of part of it right now with this whole thing that we're doing with the silly stickers you have stuck on your computers and water bottles. It kind of matters what we're doing right now. You and I are both a product of this 20 year thing that we're talking about. We're not just casual observers of it. We are living through it. And we're figuring out what to do with it. And the very fact that you and I are here doing this together means you've felt it too. And you think there's something transcendent about this document we look at together. You think that there is something historically unique about the person of Jesus Christ and about the claims surrounding Jesus, about the claims of His resurrection, and about the values of His kingdom, or you wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be putting your time into it. So, yeah, there's been a lot of doom and gloom of late. And I think for the most part, we're seeing that that was more of a reset and a recalibration, a moving on from bloated things that maybe made sense once, maybe some of them never even made sense at all. And to something that I think is going to be a beautiful moment in the history of the kingdom of God that you and I are going to get to be a part of, maybe even formative in somehow. So, you know, turn it over all my cards here. I'm frankly enormously optimistic about where people are headed, where the world is headed in terms of belief and hope in Christ. And it's why I have an endless appetite for this. I think it's real and it's true. I have gone through a deep faith crisis where I didn't know what to make of it, and the whole thing kind of broke for me for a while, but I can't shake it. I keep coming back. And I think if people are honest, there are just a ton of people like me who are going through a real similar process, who are a product of the same age, who have one foot from childhood in the old ways before this giant change, and another foot and adulthood on the other side of all of this. I'm guessing there are a ton of you who are nodding right now. Yeah, that's me too. And in the midst of all of this, yeah, we went through a rough moment in terms of training up people to lead in this regard. And I get it. I understand why it happened. I'm excited that it's rebounding now and rebounding in new ways. But you and I, my friends, just lived through a moment that serves as a cautionary example of what happens if there isn't a plan and agreed upon plan for how to provide for the training and establishment of pastors and priests and honorable spiritual leaders for the people in a society. It can dry up really quickly. So my college closed, and that's a bummer. My seminary is still open. And then any other places I went to school, I mean, there's state schools. They're probably not going anywhere. And that's nice. I like those. Like I said, I met my wife. I learned a bunch of stuff. So I'm grateful for everything that happened there. And I understand that times change and that circumstances change. And all of that helps me understand this little provision in the middle of this covenant renewal that is being proclaimed by the descendants of Abraham in Nehemiah chapter 10. All of this stuff I have lived through and talked about with you helps me way better understand why this provision is here in Nehemiah 10, 36, and why this provision to bring the firstborn son for some sort of worker responsibility around the temple was so needed and so forward thinking. And the fact that Judaism in any form is still something that exists, I think can be traced directly to the forethought, the foresight and the commitment that was made here in 444 BC in Nehemiah chapter 10. That was a lot of stuff. I said a lot of things. I'm really grateful for you being willing to hang with me for an unusually long episode that took us in an unusual different direction. I hope it was fun. I do not intend to make a habit of it. We will be back to our regularly scheduled length of programming. Mannana. All right, that is plenty for now. I'm Matt.
