It's fast, fun, free, daily deep dive Bible. And right now we're talking about Galatians. Hey everybody, it's Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast. And when I went on my first ever big, crazy eye opening overseas adventure of my whole life. I don't mean like Canada or Latin America. I mean you get on a plane, you fly over in ocean. Everything is completely unfamiliar. You're learning stuff left and right. You had no idea the world was so big and diverse. That kind of trip. I was lucky enough to get to do that when I was in my 20s. And I thought I knew things about the world. Because I didn't know as many things about the world as I believe that I did. And we went to several different countries on that trip on the continent of Africa. And I don't mean like stopped by and went to a fancy airport in Nairobi or some pleasant shopping center in Johannesburg, South Africa, back before the last few years where things have been a little bit wild there. No, I mean I got into the deep, deep, deep, wild backwoods jungle that the super deep bush stuff there in Africa and several different countries. It was an amazing trip. I saw incredible things. You know what? Before I get to the point, I'm going to tell you one of the incredible things I saw. I saw a guy wearing a monkey backpack. You're probably thinking like, Oh, I got my kids. One of those when they were two is adorable. Like a friendly monkey is all free. Like a stuffed animal, but it also had a zipper so you could store things in there. Do you mean that map from the internet? Is that what you're talking about? Is that what the man in the bush in the jungle was wearing out there there in Africa? No. I mean, literally the guy murdered a monkey, hollowed it out, broke all its limbs and deboned it and then tied its left leg and its left arm together at the wrist and the ankle to make one backpack strap and then did the same thing with its right arm and its right leg and then opened it up at the neck so there you could reach down into the tanned pouch, which was the hollowed out cavity of the monkey and then the friendly monkey head that was just like the little flap to keep things from getting rainy in there. Maybe you're vomiting. Well imagine and seeing it and you're in your twenties and the weirdest thing that you've ever done in your life. This is you went to a Mongolian grill one time and you didn't know how to mix things together and now you're in Africa and you're seeing a guy with a monkey backpack. Also he was naked. It was a very unusual time in my life. Well one of the things that happened on that trip is I made the okay and then thumbs up gesture to dude in one of these countries who we were working with. He was a local and he was like hey we need to go do this thing next and I was like alright thumbs up okay thumbs up and I got pulled aside. Everybody responded really negatively to that and I got pulled aside. I was like hey that doesn't work real well here. That's not the nicest gesture. I was like okay I'm sorry what does it mean. Come here. Oh my goodness what have I done. I'm here to represent the Lord. This is a mission trip. I am a monster. I had a pretty good laugh about it and I learned and I just I guess I needed to know though why it was offensive. What in particular about the gesture was offensive because it's one thing to just slap my hand and say that's naughty don't do it anymore. But come on even if I'm a relatively young adult I'm an adult here and I'm trying to get a delay of the land and feel things out so I don't make an idiot of myself and offend people needlessly in the future. Walk me through why it was bad then when he actually the missionary said the words of why it was bad maybe I kind of regretted actually knowing no you want to know why something is offensive. I want to know why something is offensive in the Bible. I want to know why the cross is offensive because the cross seems nice when I usually think about it. I mean yeah you know people got crucified on it and stuff but it's a nice symbol that means nice things means forgiveness. It's the symbol of Christianity. I'm a Christian so you'd think that I would think it was nice and I would like it but Paul says this in Galatians 5 verse 11. Brothers and sisters if I'm still preaching circumcision why am I being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. Well I think it's time for you and I to have the conversation where we work through why it's offensive. Okay I got a few different possibilities here and I don't actually I don't totally know the answer to this probably all of these are maybe a little bit right. Here we go. Reason number one the cross is offensive because it offends our notions of justice. People do bad things they should be held to account for those bad things. Our notions of justice are good by the way. We see things that are wrong and to skew from the right moral order that God has baked into things and it bothers us. It's gross something's off about it and we don't want stuff to go unchecked. I mean okay well hold on a minute. I do want stuff to go unchecked when it's me because I'm different. I'm mommy's special little boy and when I do bad things that are unjust and it goes unpunished that's different because I'm special little boy but everybody else that does bad things that demands justice. And so we all feel this idea and what does the cross do? The cross is like a heat sink. It absorbs all of that energy that energy of God's judgment and justice instead of going where it ought to go toward the bad people not me but actually will bad people that instead just all went to Jesus like a lightning rod standing up there on that hill that Golgotha I mean okay it sounds nice and principle but maybe part of the reason the cross is offensive is sometimes we want to see a little justice doled out. Not to us or people we like but just to remind everybody to keep their business together and to be able to imagine that there's some sort of cosmic sense of order where stuff gets dealt with. And with the cross we just don't get to see it. How are they going to learn? Will they feel the consequences of all of that? Maybe that's part of why the offense of the cross is there. Okay before we talk about more options for the offense of the cross I mean though I guess we had to think about this in context that's a pretty good rule when you read the Bible or anything I suppose. If I still preach circumcision then the offense of the cross has been abolished. Alright in this context we're saying that circumcision is a sign of obeying the whole law. So circumcision then in this conversation it's a metaphor it's a symbol of it's the epitome of you trying to do the whole thing and keeping score and being like there God I did enough right things and didn't do too many bad things therefore I have earned your favor and right standing with you per the terms and stipulations of your law and I'm one of the few people who was able to ace it I mastered your law I navigated it properly. The thesis of Galatians is that doesn't work and that brings a curse upon the person who tries to do it. So you shouldn't do that rather the thesis of Galatians is you should put your faith in Jesus like Abraham and anybody who's ever been made right with God put your faith in God and God is the one who does the work. So I think the idea here or one way to read it is that if you try to go with circumcision which is a symbol an outward way to say I'm going with the whole law I'm going this on my own I can do it through self-discipline and exemplary behavior if you do that and you then go on and preach that then like the whole shocking point of the cross which is grace for people who don't deserve it God taking on flesh and taking on the penalty for the sin of people he shows mercy to that whole offense the whole shocking thing that kind of makes Christianity work the greatest reversal twist surprise in all of the Bible all of human history it's neutered it doesn't mean anything anymore it's just jewelry it's stupid it doesn't make any sense. Okay so that's one option okay another reason I alluded to it a minute ago maybe this idea of the cross being an offense is a nod back to the stuff that Paul was saying in chapter three when he was quoting from the book of Deuteronomy and he's saying the stuff about cursed as everyone who doesn't obey every single thing written in the book of the law which is a reference to dang it I don't remember see this is what happens why you write things down what I think I got is it looks like it's Deuteronomy 27 is where that one was so it's a reference back to that and then the idea is that then you know it also says the curse is everyone who's hung on a pole this is just back in Galatians 3 and so then further the idea is that Jesus became the curse he didn't just suffer the consequences of it he became the curse well that's offensive Jesus is the ultimate good guy he didn't do anything wrong my kid just finished lined animal farm by George Orwell last night positive for like muted for like 20 seconds if you haven't read this book but he came in he's like I got about 20% to go cool what character do you like the best I like boxer the horse he's loyal and he's faithful and he does the right thing who don't you like I don't like the pigs my son said and he walked out of the room to go finish the book and my wife and I looked at each other and we're like we should probably go tell him because I don't want his heart to break because he has a very tender little heart so I went in and talked to him was like hey dude the pigs they trickbox are into going to the glue factory why would a horse go to a glue factory dad oh that's right I don't think that's how they make glue anymore because they used to make glue out of horses buddy no yeah I'm sorry man I'm sorry and then I explained the point of animal farm and we had a lovely conversation about it and he finished the book and sure enough it moved him very deeply why was he offended by what squealer and Napoleon and the pigs and animal farm did to noble boxer because boxer was the good guy he didn't have it coming he shouldn't have endured that scandalous indignified horrible fate but he did and my little boy was smart enough to know that doesn't feel right well I suppose that's part of the offense of the cross as well it doesn't feel right the precious lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world I mean that's what John the Baptist was Jesus cousin said about him Jesus who knew no sin who grew in wisdom and stature in favor with God and men Jesus who was loyal to his father's plan all the way through Jesus who knew exactly what he was here to do and how difficult it would be but did it anyway Jesus who stooped who washed the feet of his disciples Jesus who being in very nature God didn't consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage rather this is the Jesus who made himself nothing by taking on the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man this is the Jesus who humbled himself by becoming obedient to death even death on a cross the scandalous kind of death that's the Jesus we're talking about here is even better than boxer from animal farming is the best it's offensive what they did to him it's offensive to the order of things it's offensive to the notion of what's right that really transcends all culture that Jesus was who he was Jesus is who he is and that that's what happened to him now in the offense of the cross you know obviously we're going to pause before I get to my next you next time around but in the offense of the cross there's something beautiful on the other side of it that's why Paul is an apostle of it and an advocate for it he preaches the message of the cross preaches Christ crucified but you what happens as a result of that offense that seemingly just complete total upside down moral insanity of having the best character go to the cross what happens as a result well God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that's above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven on earth and under the earth and every tongue will acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father so don't get me wrong the offense ends up working out but we're not really working on how does it work out we're working on why is that offensive and I think we have two pretty good candidates so far and we'll look at a couple more good candidates for an explanation as to why the cross is offensive next time around I'm sorry if I offended any of you by describing an okay symbol on a thumbs up I don't know where you live maybe that's very offensive where you live I'm super sorry I'm not sorry about the monkey backpack story I'm
