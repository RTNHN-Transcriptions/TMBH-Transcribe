If you weren't limited to the couple of options that you think you only have, if you were king of everything, what would you do? And then usually there's something good that comes out of that because you brainstorm outside the box and also maybe more importantly, you get to the heart of really what is driving the conundrum, really what drives you. You get to the heart of what you most care about, that singular thing. And in Nehemiah chapter two, we run into a situation where it's not hypothetical. Somebody who actually could give our point of view character, Nehemiah, the namesake of the book that we're working on right now, somebody that can actually give him just about anything he wants has handed him a blank check. What do you want? All right. You're sad? I understand the situation. What do you want? And Nehemiah, prudently, is going to take a second to breathe and reflect and pray to God to do one last gut check as to what it is that really is his prime motivation. What is he really trying to accomplish? And then he's going to give his answer. He will probably never have an opportunity like this again for the rest of his life. He's probably never had an opportunity like this before. This really is a dream scenario, the richest, most powerful person in the world. You found favor in their eyes and they say, OK, I hear your plight. What do you want? What would you do? Well, here's what Nehemiah does. And Nehemiah two, one, Nehemiah's mustered the courage to go into the throne room. And he's allowing himself to look how he actually feels. What did that physically look like? I don't know. He realized about a few different possibilities last time around. But whatever the case, Artaxerxes seems to be a very socially attentive man. That's how he's presented here. And he picks up something is off with Nehemiah. You can tell that he's sad. He said, you've never looked sad in my presence before. What's going on? And Nehemiah in his own words says I was very much afraid, but muster encouraged. But I said to the king, may the king live forever? Why should my face not look sad when the city where my father's are buried, lies in ruins? And its gates have been destroyed by fire. Now a lot of these kings in the ancient world, they're pretty touchy. And if you bother them with your stuff in any way, maybe they would react in crazy goofy or his guards take this man away. I think Nehemiah had a well placed suspicion given his sense of the relationship that it wouldn't go that way. But wow, I wonder if Nehemiah could even bring himself to hope for the positivity of the outcome of that exchange. Because in verse four, Nehemiah reports that the king said to me, what is it that you want? There's the blank check. Now here's the moment of focus. Then I prayed to the God of heaven and I answered the king. If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it. You know, I think he could have gone bigger. I think he could have asked for more money or more power or point me the satrap of the land beyond the river so that I can oversee this and ensure the well being of my give me power so that I can use it for them. He doesn't ask for that. Give me endless riches so I can funnel that off. I'll use them in a good way to care for my people. If I've served you well, I think I've earned it. Nope, he doesn't do that. He really just asks for a trip. Now he knows that logistically, there's no way that this is going to be free to the king. He's going to have to have somebody else be his cup bearer. That's a pretty big cost to the king. I mean, think about this request. Who's the backup cup bearer? It's a position entirely rooted in trust. It's a position that you're sharing food. Literally, you're breaking bread. Every meal you're sharing with this one person, literally everybody else in your life. Might come and go, but that one guy, Nehemiah, the cup bearer, he's not just breaking bread with you. He's ordering the same thing off the menu every single time, which means you're shooting the breeze about lighthearted stuff. Some days it means other days he's just sitting in there. He's hearing everything that's being said. You better believe the king is conducting business over meals. You better believe the king is also conducting business in the evening over appetizers and shark crudy boards. Ting it. I don't know how to pronounce that word. Well, there it is. Now you know, I don't know how to say shark cutery. Do you say shark cutery? I can't be short. I don't know. That's just going to have to be a riddle for me. Shark cutery boards. That sounds delicious. I'm like exactly what I would want to eat if I were the king of everything. You know what I mean? Those boards with all the food on them. He's eating that stuff and conducting serious business that people would kill. You're talking about the kind of money, the kind of stakes that people would do insane things over. Nehemiah is there for all of it. And there's no way that the king is going to respond as favorably as he has. If occasionally Nehemiah is a little bit loose-lipped about stuff, maybe he tested a bit too much wine for the king and accidentally went and ran his mouth off a little bit about some shrewd important political maneuver or coup or rebellion that has to be put down that was super secret and only the king and a couple advisors know about. There's no way. Nehemiah isn't batting 99% in terms of integrity. He's batting 100%. He does not make mistakes. Everything about the king's reputation and well-being is in Nehemiah's hands. So that brings me to the second point. One, it's an expensive ask for the king because he's going to be without literally the most trusted person in his empire. But two, he's going to have to pay for this trip and it's going to have to be guarded and patrolled in some way. The king has to ensure that this man who knows everything will either travel secretly so nobody would know who he is or what secrets he would hold or that this guy would travel very publicly and it would be very clear from the retinue sent along with him that if you touch this man, you touch the king, tread very lightly bandit's scallywags. This is the king's man of the highest order. It's a pricey ask. It seems like to you and me, maybe with the relationships we have with our workplaces now that this is just like a ask him for an extra week off of vacation or something and really, he's not gone that long. It turns out to be a pretty quick trip. We'll get to that later. But what the king is giving up and what the king has vested in Nehemiah means for him to go really, it's a pretty big ask. It's a pretty big deal still smaller than give me massive power or give me massive money. Well, we just got this hanging out here now. This is really big, really significant request that really meaningfully impacts not just the life of the king, but the functioning of the entire empire, which at this point in history, is more or less the entire western and near eastern world. There's some India and China that we know about that wouldn't be under the authority of this king. And there's a few little city states in Greece and some barbarian tribes, but more or less, everyone's life is going to be affected in some way they might not recognize, but still affected nonetheless by Nehemiah going on this trip. It's a bigger deal than you or I would think at first glance. So what's the king going to do with it? Verse six, let's see how this goes. Then the king with the queen sitting beside him. Whoa. Oh, okay. That complicates things, doesn't it? I don't know for sure what kind of relationship Artaxerxes had with his queen. We don't know, as I've told you before, nearly as much about Artaxerxes as we do about Xerxes and Darius and even Cambyses and Bardiad and Cyrus the Great, because the account of Herodotus runs out at basically the end of the life of Xerxes. So they always say that you have all kinds of gripes with Herodotus because of the way he told stories and potential inaccuracies, but boy, do you miss him when he's gone. And our knowledge of Persia is falls off a cliff as soon as Herodotus isn't telling us about it anymore. So what we've cobbled together about Artaxerxes is way, way less. In fact, in a lot of ways, what we're getting right here in Nehemiah is the most in color view. We get of him maybe anywhere. So you and I as readers were sort of outside, standing in the dark here. We don't know exactly what we're going to get from her. Is this one of those politically arranged marriages where they don't really like each other, but it was expedient to keep the empire together? Maybe. Was this the kind of marriage where they totally love each other? And it's more like your marriage, assuming it's happy. I hope your marriage is happy. Mine is so happy. Does she feel about him the way Camilla feels about me? Well, I hope so. I would wish that for anybody. It's one of the richest blessings I could ever imagine in anybody's life ever. And I would wish it even on my worst enemy because it's a beautiful thing to be loved by somebody else, to that degree and that selflessly. I don't know. But what I do know is this that whatever kind of marriage this was, this decision affects her a lot because if she loves him and he gets poisoned and he dies, well, then she loses the love of her life. If she doesn't love him and then he gets poisoned and he dies because Nehemiah is gone, she's probably going to die too because whoever poisoned him, they're going to remove the entire royal family, including their kids and any potential heir. That is how these things work. So she's got skin in the game here and the fact that she is sitting there and that Nehemiah goes out of his way to mention that is not an accident. It is an understandable and reasonable complication to his request. And yet, here we are. Well, next time around, we'll find out if Artaxerxes really was in toning the blank check nature of his question or if what Nehemiah has asked is just too much. And that is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
