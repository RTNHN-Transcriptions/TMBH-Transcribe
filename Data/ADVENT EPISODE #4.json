This is what we've been anticipating what we've been looking forward to and There's this little chunk of the Christmas story in Luke chapter 2. I'm not gonna do all of the Christmas story But this is one little bit that I want to read starting in verse 9 It says an angel of the Lord appeared to them then being the shepherds and the glory of the Lord shown around them And they were terrified which is perfectly understandable, but the angel said to them Don't be afraid I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you He's Christ the Lord. This will be assigned to you You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger And then suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with that angel praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests and Then the angels go away and the shepherds go and find the holy family just as they had been told But how about that line? That sums up Really everything that the Bible is going for all of this I mean the reason why for everything like the reason why for their being things instead of not things for their being Existence instead of not existence for it being this particular existence instead of some other one that an infinite eternal deity could have imagined The reason for all of it is right there on the front end of what the angels say in chorus glory to God It's the only thing that is universally Unendingly true that makes sense of the whole narrative There is one being who is so right who is so flawless who is so perfect who is so other from everything else that has been made There's only one being that isn't made and doesn't change and doesn't need to change and can't change because there is no change Or growth or learning to be had there's only one being like this and all of existence the narrative the story the physical world the creativity the unfolding of time all of it exists for the exaltation to point out the incredibleness the amazingness the vastness of this completely other creator being Who is totally unique in all of the history of ever and operates outside even of the history of ever glory to God in the highest So Jesus shows up and first and foremost the reason that is great is because glory to God look who he is look at what he's done Look at how he is but also glory to God because there's the actual promise of peace in what he's doing and on earth peace to men on whom his favorite rests and that favor and that peace are this source of great joy we did all this anticipation What are we looking forward to okay? Remembering the day and picking a day. That's a bit of an arbitrary pick to be like that's the day that God took on flesh That's the day that the incarnation happened and that is wonderful to commemorate that But there is a current now active Impulse that is supposed to be present that is the real point right it's not just remembering it is The living is being a part of its existing in that story that according to this is defined by joy and hope and peace and the glory of God What feels like a chaotic? Strung out disconnected story that nobody could ever make sense of it turns out somebody's in charge of it It turns out there's a plan it turns out there's actually order to this thing There always was and you fit into that plan you fit into this family of faith that is being created and announced by these angels in this place and This birth and remembering this birth and internalizing what it means is meant to push back the darkness It's meant to drive out hatred and fear and exhaustion and dividedness and war and turmoil And the things that eat us up inside it's meant to drive back the darkness of the failure shame Humiliation whatever the things are that nip at your heels all of that stuff that is bleak and broken and awful and that taints The experience that you and I live in our short little lifetimes. It's all beaten here and yeah It's true that the fullness and the completion of that is not something that we experience in this lifetime Because darkness still exists, but that pushback it's already happening here And it's something that right now we experience in part with the promise and the demonstration that later will experience it fully This then is the celebration of the light of God breaking into the darkness of the world and well It's true the darkness won't always understand it or doesn't always understand it right now That light is still the truest realist thing and it shines right now And we get to put eyes on something that pure and that true and see it and understand it better And then have it change us and become a part of what that is with the promise of fully becoming a part of This kingdom of God this new family of faith fully in the presence of this light that broke into the darkness forever It's kind of a lot to take in but those are the promises we're looking at that's the narrative that we're looking at and That's the role that we get to play in this thing as God redeems what is broken Thank you for all of the hours. You've spent with me thinking about that over the last year over the last couple of years I really value you. I appreciate you. I look forward to more of that Merry Christmas You", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.0, "text": " Advent episode and Advent episode", "tokens": [33732, 4471, 290, 33732, 4471], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4799402157465617, "compression_ratio": 1.5833333333333333, "no_speech_prob": 0.05847837030887604}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 5.0, "end": 9.0, "text": " The 10 minute Bible hour podcast", "tokens": [383, 838, 5664, 9111, 1711, 9905], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4799402157465617, "compression_ratio": 1.5833333333333333, "no_speech_prob": 0.05847837030887604}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 11.0, "end": 15.0, "text": " It's an Advent episode and Advent episode", "tokens": [632, 338, 281, 33732, 4471, 290, 33732, 4471], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4799402157465617, "compression_ratio": 1.5833333333333333, "no_speech_prob": 0.05847837030887604}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 16.0, "end": 20.0, "text": " Of the 10 minute Bible hour", "tokens": [3226, 262, 838, 5664, 9111, 1711], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4799402157465617, "compression_ratio": 1.5833333333333333, "no_speech_prob": 0.05847837030887604}, {"id": 4, "seek": 0, "start": 21.0, "end": 24.0, "text": " My guest", "tokens": [2011, 8319], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4799402157465617, "compression_ratio": 1.5833333333333333, "no_speech_prob": 0.05847837030887604}, {"id": 5, "seek": 0, "start": 26.0, "end": 27.0, "text": " Hey my friends, it's Matt", "tokens": [14690, 616, 2460, 11, 340, 338, 4705], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4799402157465617, "compression_ratio": 1.5833333333333333, "no_speech_prob": 0.05847837030887604}, {"id": 6, "seek": 2700, "start": 27.0, "end": 31.68, "text": " This is the 10 minute Bible hour and it is Christmas and you have things to do and so I am going to be brief", "tokens": [770, 318, 262, 838, 5664, 9111, 1711, 290, 340, 318, 6786, 290, 345, 423, 1243, 284, 466, 290, 523, 314, 716, 1016, 284, 307, 4506], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.14741606678036476, "compression_ratio": 1.8074534161490683, "no_speech_prob": 3.6010833355248906e-06}, {"id": 7, "seek": 2700, "start": 31.8, "end": 37.519999999999996, "text": " But this is our last special bonus Advent episode because now we're to the day", "tokens": [887, 428, 318, 674, 938, 2041, 7202, 33732, 4471, 780, 783, 356, 821, 284, 262, 1110], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.14741606678036476, "compression_ratio": 1.8074534161490683, "no_speech_prob": 3.6010833355248906e-06}, {"id": 8, "seek": 2700, "start": 38.0, "end": 42.88, "text": " That is the celebration.
