This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast and we've got some stuff to do today. This is a very serious day. It's not a day for messing around. We got to go and talk about the mosaic covenant because that'll help us understand why Ezra was so upset that he ripped his beard out with his bare hands to let everybody know, hey, I'm so upset that I ripped my beard out with my bare hands because I got here to Jerusalem. It turns out that you all are violating the covenant with God and I am deeply unhappy and unbearted about this. Out of the context, or apart from the context of what the deal is that they were violating, he's just looks like a crazy dude who's way been out of shape and maybe a little bit racist because he's mad that the Jews are marrying other people. But I don't think that he's a crazy guy or a racist. I think he's somebody who has a priest deeply understands the deal, the unique deal between God and his chosen people in the Old Testament. I think he's a guy as we've discussed over the last few weeks who sees the unfolding of history more clearly than most people do, especially in the moment. He's not just somebody who's willing to sit around and speculate like your uncle Larry who's got some opinions about what the politicians are doing and how the things are. I tell you why I saw a thing on Facebook the other day. They're doing the thing with the guy's going to. But then they don't do anything. I like uncle Larry and I appreciate his theories and opinions. But the guy who's compelling to me is the guy like Ezra, the one who looks at what's going on and says, I am so confident that this is what's happening in the grand unfolding of history right now that I'm going to change my behavior and actions and investments to align with what I'm pretty sure is going on. Ezra, the point is, he's not just some cooke idiot, racist, insane guy who does public pouting performance art. He sees something. He's rooted in a bigger story. And in order for us to understand his actions here in Ezra chapter nine, we got to understand what he sees a little bit better. So that's why we got to go back to Exodus and look at where this whole deal between God and his chosen people starts. So there's no time for messing around except I saw this hilarious video on Twitter the other day. There's a cat and a baby raccoon. Nope. Nope. Nope. No messing around. We can't not have to tell you about that video another day. Exodus 19. God has already made it clear to his chosen people through the covenant he made with Abraham all the way back in Genesis that they're going to be unique people that he's got is making a people out of thin air. It's going to be the descendants of Abraham. And even though the dude doesn't even have any kids yet, there's going to be gajillion of them. They're going to be this huge family. It's going to be an amazing family. It's amazing story. Specifically, God says that they will be blessed, but that also they will be a blessing to all the nations and that initiates this theme, this unconditional deal that God makes with Abraham back in Genesis, initiates this theme, this through line that runs through the whole Bible that says eventually every knee is going to bow, every tongue is going to confess, everybody is going to see who the one true God is and they're they'll be reckoning. It's all going to come together and all the nations with all the different opinions and styles and cultures and sensibilities and everything. Eventually, everybody's going to see this thing and the working out of all of that is going to happen. The narrative, the story that causes all of this to play out is going to happen through Abraham's descendants. So that unconditional covenant, that unconditional deal is something Ezra would have had in mind in Ezra chapter 9 when he says that he's upset because the returning Jewish exiles are intermarrying and adopting the detestable practices of their neighboring tribes and when he's pulling his beard out and his hair out and putting on sackcloth, that covenant with Abraham, he was called Abraham at the time, would have been in view for Ezra. But then we skip to the next book, Exodus, and another covenant gets made. This time, the human representative of this covenant with God is Moses. But this time around the deal is conditional. It's not a no matter how big of an idiot you act like, I am still going to do this for my own glory and it's going to happen. That's what the deal that God made with David was like is what the deal he made with Abraham was like. But this one with Moses, their terms, their conditions, there's a list of blessings and curses and God spells out effectively over the course of what is it like, five chapters, Exodus 19 through Exodus 24. I think is where people generally put this. He spells out in a bunch of different ways over the course of a long multifaceted conversation. The basically this, I'm going to be your God. You're going to be my people. Everybody's going to know that I'm the one true God through this relationship because if you obey me, I'm going to bless you. If you disobey me, I'm going to punish you. And over in Deuteronomy, I think 24, I've got it written down over here. I'm going to find it in a second. Nope, I'm wrong. It's Deuteronomy 28 is where we get more of the spelling out of that list. So this covenant is kind of spread out a little bit between God and the Hebrew people through Moses in Exodus and Deuteronomy. But the gist of it is entirely knowable and distillable. It's really spelled out right here in Exodus 19. Just a couple chapters earlier, the Hebrew people have fled from the pursuing Egyptian cavalry and you get the famous parting of the Red Sea incident. And now they're on the other side and they're playing songs and dancing around. This is the best thing ever. God be praised. But then in like the very next chapter, they're mad about things and complaining. And we realize this is going to be, it's going to be tricky. And they feel a little bit directionless. And then we get to chapter 19 at a site called Mount Sinai. There's historical debate about exactly where that location is. But at Mount Sinai, God makes his covenant with his people and that listlessness and lack of direction becomes a lot more focused. The trajectory of their story is individuals and as a people crystallizes. And it goes like this. In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt on the very day, they came to the desert of Sinai after they set out from Refidim. Maybe I said that right. They entered the desert of Sinai and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountains. Okay. Well, this is all nice so far. Then Moses went up to God and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said, okay, wow, did that accelerate from a camping trip itinerary to God is there now and he's talking to someone. And this is what God said. This is what you were to say to the house of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel. You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried you on Eagle's wings and brought you to myself. Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations, you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites. So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and the Sephi for them, all the words of the Lord had commanded him to speak. The people all responded together. We will do everything the Lord has said. So Moses brought their answer back to the Lord. The Lord then said to Moses, I'm going to come to you in a dense cloud so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you. Then Moses said to the Lord what the people had said. And verse 10, and the Lord said to Moses, go to the people and to consecrate them today and tomorrow have them wash their clothes and be ready by the third day because on that day, the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. You notice how God is doing something really exceptional here. He's giving visual credence to what is happening so that it won't be received as Moses just goes up there and then he comes back with new rules and he's like, that's how God wants the things to be. God is eliminating excuses left and right as if parting the Red Sea in front of everyone in a timely fashion and then closing it back in on their enemies wasn't enough as if clouds with fire coming out of them and things like that wasn't enough as if the plagues in Egypt weren't enough. God's presence is going to be made evident here. Now you and I have talked about the theme of the presence of the Lord and all of that, a whole bunch. I talked about that a bunch in my episodes from season two on Exodus, a bit of numbers in Deuteronomy and all of that. Maybe go catch those as a refresher. It might be helpful here as well if you want to or don't see internet, you can do whatever you want. But sure enough, God shows up just like he said right on time. All the things happen. It's foggy and smoky and cloudy and there's fire and it's just abundantly clear. Yeah, that's God. There is again, then we should not go close to that because we can't get close to that level of holiness. And then in the next chapter, Exodus 20, you get the recitation of the Ten Commandments. God gives people this basic core set of laws for them to cling to and there's more thunder and lightning and they hear the trumpet and they see the mountain in smoke and they tremble with fear and they stay at a distance. And then God says, tell the Israelites. He says this to Moses, verse 22 of Exodus 20, you have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven. Don't make any gods to be alongside me. Do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold. Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you. And he lays out more of the details about how exactly he wants that to be done. And then really from here on out, a huge percentage of what we get from the rest of the book is God laying out. This is how it's going to be. This is what the deal is going to look like. And there are several little dance steps that you might think are petty or not that big a deal, but God's like, they're a big deal to me. There are reasons for this and some of it, he seems to let them know what the reasons are. They don't build an altar in this way because I don't want you going up the steps real high and having your nakedness be visible underneath your cloak when you walk up steps that are built in this way instead build it like this. Like literally it gets into that level of specificity here over the next several chapters. And then as I said, there's a listing of blessings and curses that comes up as well later on in Deuteronomy. We're going to look at that more tomorrow. But you get the gist, right? But Ezra has in view as he sees the calamity of the people upon his return in Ezra chapter nine. What he has in view is a violation of this very ancient covenant and the covenant is conditional. And he has a clear view of history and he knows the character of the God on the other side of the covenant. And he's like, you guys, just, you just mess in with things, things that are powerful enough to make lightning and fire and cloud and break the laws of time and space. And we want the presence of the Lord with us again here. And this is exactly the kind of stuff that makes it so that we don't have fellowship with the Lord. And then we get on the list of curses and punishment side instead of the list of the blessing side. And so he's heartbroken over it. And if we understand that, we understand his behavior a little bit better. We understand the drama of his behavior a little bit better. And tomorrow we're going to dig around more in Exodus and Deuteronomy and try to understand Ezra and his motivations and his thinking better yet. That's something I'm going to have to tell you about that hilarious video that I saw. So, whoo, so good someday, another day, far from now. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour podcast.
