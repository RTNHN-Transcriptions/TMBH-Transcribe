There's a whole bunch of people congregate, like Chicago. I went there for undergrad and then grad school. I lived in the front range of Colorado growing up. That's a pretty neat place. Lots of people like that. I lived in Vegas for a year. That was an odd year. But I have some good friendships that came out of that so I can't fault it too much. But for the most part, I've lived in what you'd call flyover country. The stuff that maybe when historians look back on the world 100 years from now, these places just aren't going to come up. This isn't the part of the world where the news happens or maybe it should be news, but people are interested in things that happen in flashier parts of the country, flashier parts of the world. For those of us who do live in flyover country, most of us are totally cool with that. In the New Testament, when we're talking about the public ministry of Jesus, we've got some pretty popular places that come up again and again and again. Capernaum keeps coming up. Jerusalem is obviously going to be a big deal, but you've also got your flyover country locations that, if you're hung around the New Testament for a little while, you recognize these names. But if somebody put it to you and they're like, hey, what happened in those particular flyover towns, you probably have to dig through your Bible to remember what it was. And two of these flyover territory towns come up in Matthew chapter 11 when Jesus is proclaiming his statements of woe against these particular locations where apparently miraculous stuff had happened in front of them. A declaration of the kingdom of God had happened in front of them and they were just like, I don't know. I don't really see it. I'm not really into it. I think I'll probably just take a pass. And so Jesus says, well, I'll just read from the beginning, Matthew 11, 20, then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent. It's like a way tighter way of saying what I just said. That was good job, Bible. You win this round. Verse 21, it goes on quote, woe to you, Corazine woe to you, Bethseta. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed entire and side on, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. Okay, this is going to be fun because we're going to do one of those history things where we break down these locations over the next couple of days. Not on the surface. Whenever we do this, like, Oh, no, this is going to be super boring, but then you're wrong because history is super interesting. Corazine and Bethseta were not flyover locations to the people of the day, but they were fly over locations to the authors of the New Testament. In the time, Corazine and Bethseta were both very close to Capernaum, which is the home base of Jesus ministry. There may be a couple of miles away. If you go there now, you can go to a location that is associated with Corazine. There's good reason to believe that when you're there, you're actually in the town looking at the ruins and the street layouts that the disciples would have walked through and encountered when they were hanging out there. Just a chapter earlier when Jesus sent them out to the Northern Galilean area on their great big open world quest that they went on. Bethseta is a little bit trickier to nail down there. People who actually know what they're talking about and are not me who write articles that are very complex about exactly where Bethseta is located. Some people even speculate that there were two Bethseta's maybe existing at the same time. Maybe one existed first and then the other one came along a little bit later. Some people have proposed that it's hard to find where Bethseta is because the route of the Jordan River, which is running at the north of the Sea of Galilee, is changed over time. And so since Bethseta is understood to have been up against the left bank, the west bank of the Jordan River north of the Sea of Galilee where it enters into the Sea of Galilee, that part of the reason we can't nail it down is because we're not totally clear on where the Jordan River was at that time. But just because we aren't a hundred percent sure where these two locations are doesn't mean we aren't a hundred percent sure they were there in the first place. First century sources confirm the existence of these towns outside the Bible and everybody in the original audience would have thought of Corzine and especially Bethseta just based on where it was sitting as pretty significant influential towns up north. If I remember right and there's been a little while since I read about this, I believe Bethseta was even upgraded at some point from an official designation as a village to an official designation as a polis or a city state. I don't recall when that happened, but if it was upgraded to something called a polis, it would have been after the time of Greek influence. So there either had been growth very recently before the time of Jesus or was growth in close proximity thereafter. Again on this next thing, I'm not totally sure on the reliability, but I think if I recall correctly, some people associate Bethseta with Peter and his family's original home and they have reason to believe that Peter and his family relocated to Capernaum somewhere in the mix, but there's some kind of ancestral connection between Peter and Bethseta as well. So these two towns were not fly over country to the original audience or the people of northern Galilee at the time, but again, as I said earlier, they are fly over towns to the gospel writers who just don't mention any miracles having happened in Corzine. And Jesus right here is like, hey, look at all the stuff that Corzine has seen. They should definitely get what's going on with me and even these awful towns that we'll talk about probably tomorrow. Man, if they'd seen the stuff that Corzine had seen, they would get it. What this does is it speaks to the enormous scope of how much stuff happened in Jesus' public ministry in his lifetime. And there's the verse in John. You probably know exactly where I'm going here. John, what is it? Last chapter 20-ish. No, it's John 20, not 21. Verse 30, John says, Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. So John, the author of the gospel, John, there is just turning over his cards as to why he included the miracles he did. And presumably why he excluded the ones he excluded. I didn't need to quote them all. I didn't have enough room to write them all down. I gave you what you needed though to create a coherent narrative that demonstrates that Jesus is the Son of God and that you would have what you need in front of you to believe in him. Well, what we're getting here is a little implicit confirmation of that johannying truth over here in Matthew. Jesus again is saying, you guys have seen a ton, but the gospel writers treat it as fly over country. Now, Corzine gets nothing. I am not aware of any coverage of any miracles specifically that happened in Corzine other than this general allusion to them, but Beth Seda, which was probably the more prominent town. We do get a little bit. And one of those is over here in Mark. I thought it was five. Maybe it's not five. Thumbing through, thumbing through, thumbing through. It is Mark eight starting in verse 22. They came to Beth Seda and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. They took the blind man by the hand and let him outside of the village where he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him and Jesus asked, do you see anything? He looked up and said, I see people. They looked like trees walking around. Once more, Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes and his eyes were opened and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly. Jesus sent him home saying, don't go into the village. So there's one of our two accounts of the miracle ever having happened in Beth Seda, a piece of Jesus says there were gazillions of them. But a quick interesting side note, notice the detailed description there that Mark gives. I see people, they look like trees walking around. A lot of people associate Mark with Peter and suggest that, I mean, even the church fathers suggest that Mark was a scribe or someone who went around with Peter while Peter was teaching publicly and relaying all these details and they suggested that's why Mark is peppered with these really personal anecdotes as you go along. The other mention of Beth Seda is in Luke 9. I'm almost sure this time around. Yes. So Luke 9, if you'll recall, opens with Jesus gathering the 12 together. He gives him authority to drive out demons, do all this stuff and it preached the message about the kingdom and all of this just like we talked about in Matthew 10 in the mission of discourse. And then interestingly, what happens right as they are coming back together picks up in Luke 9 verse 10. So in Matthew 11, we come off the missional discourse and we get nothing like Jesus went around. He taught and then some stuff happened and we just get on to the next thing with John the Baptist here. We actually get some details when the apostles returned. So they've just come off the big open world quest is dangerous to go alone. Take this. They reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Beth Seda. Hey, but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God. Hey, that's exactly the message they were working on and healed those who needed healing. Ah, so in a way, these couple of verses are summarized in Matthew chapter 11 as we come off the open world quest where it says after Jesus had finished instructing his 12 disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach and the towns of Galilee. Oh, that's exactly what happens in Luke chapter nine. We're teaching and preaching in the towns of Galilee. We're doing the miraculous stuff. He sent the disciples out to do and the message is exactly the same. It's about the kingdom. Late in the afternoon, the 12 came to him and said, send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging because we were in a remote place here. Oh, I see what we're warming up to. This is the feeding thing. And he replied, you give them something to eat and they answered. We only have the five loves of bread and the two fish and okay, this is one of the gigantic most memorable miracle stories of the whole Bible, which is the feeding of the 5,000, to which case in the same way that every now and then rapid city, South Dakota, which is in the heart of flyover country, makes it into the national news. So I guess every now and then Beth Seda, which is in gospel flyover country, makes it big time into the news as well with one of the most famous just miracles ever. Whatever the case, this stuff in Matthew chapter 11, where Jesus is proclaiming these woes to Corazine and Beth Seda is fascinating to me because it demonstrates this sort of tip of the iceberg principle. There is a little bit of stuff showing above the water that is recorded in the gospels that describes the miraculous things that Jesus did. Whereas there's a whole bunch of redundant stuff, maybe miracles that just look like another miracle almost identically. But those things as amazing as they would be if they happened at any other time in any other place were almost run of the mill and commonplace here. They were happening so much. And maybe it is that very familiarity that caused the people of Beth Seda and Corazine to be like, ah, no, it's just, there's a lot of miracles these days. And it is cool when Doug and Charlene got their gout healed, but then everybody got their gout healed and it just kind of became predictable. And admittedly, that's very speculative, but it frames up this whole flyover city situation to even possibly reflect back on the question of, well, why doesn't God do miracles all the time? If God is so real and he wants people to believe in him and he's got this kingdom and it's great. And everybody should sign up and participate. Why doesn't God just break the laws of time and space all the time for everybody in all parts of the world so that they'll see it and be like, oh, well, enough of this debating and arguing and politics and stuff. Clearly, Jesus is king. That's the truest, realest thing. I'll sign up. There's your answer right there. Apparently, a ton of this stuff happened in front of these two flyover cities and Jesus is troubled enough by the lack of response that he declares a woe and a judgment on these two cities. So hopefully that gives us enough of a sense of Bethsaida and Corazine, a little bit about what we know about them historically and what we know about them in terms of how they relate to Jesus and the whole Bible kingdom account stuff. Tomorrow, we're going to flip around and talk about who they are contrasted with that being tire and side on. So if you listen to this one, you don't listen tomorrow. You're missing out. And if you listen tomorrow and didn't listen to this one, that doesn't work. How could you possibly if you go? I'm saying I'm Matt is the 10 minute Bible hour. Let's do this again soon. I have to try it and find out what the real good it's going to do because I can't answer necessarily. I'm hoping I could give you a host offorward stories of people today, and they need cover which is way go. But also, also because it's so much fun.
