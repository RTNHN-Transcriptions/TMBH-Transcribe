And if this is your first time here, ever, what a day to jump in. Because we're talking about ancient Persian economics in the outlying satrapi beyond the river where Jerusalem was located. And it probably sounds like it's going to be super boring. And you're like, my mom, so I'd like this podcast. Now they're talking about ancient Persian economics in the first 30 seconds. I'm questioning everything about my relationship with my mom and my trust for her. But don't. You should still love your mom. Everything is going to be fine. Here's what we do on this podcast. We pick a book of the Bible and we go through the whole thing. And I have no idea how far we're going to get every day. It's basically 10 ish minutes of content every day, along with usually a little bit of goofing around on the front and back end. And right now we are in season four of all of this, which is on the Old Testament book of Nehemiah, which is set against the backdrop of the Persian Empire, great emperor Cyrus Darius Xerxes. And now Artaxerxes is the great Persian king in the book of Nehemiah. And in this book, Nehemiah was cut bare to the king clear out east in the Persian capital, but he gets word that Jerusalem is in shambles and he's a Jewish guy. So he goes to the king and gets permission to go back and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. But also effectively he gets permission to rebuild the people of people who have a long history dating all the way back to Abraham and the beginning of this massive Old Testament that we've been looking at. But it's people who are in despair, they're in disarray, they're having a tough time with things. So the walls are sort of the physical manifestation of getting stuff straightened out. We're going to secure Jerusalem, the ancient homeland of our people. But also we got to get the people back on track or those walls aren't going to mean anything because they'll fail as a people. And so in Nehemiah, we've been getting the story of how Nehemiah went and very quickly cut through all the red tape and bureaucratic nonsense and got those walls rebuilt, even though everybody's trying to stop him. And once the walls are rebuilt, we get to the second half of the book of Nehemiah where the people come together and it's like they're coming out of a fog. They're all going, what have we been doing? Not just us, but our fathers and our forefathers and all the generations before us. Why have we been getting it wrong so much? We need to get our heads screwed on straight. We need to understand what the law of God, the Old Testament is what we would call it today. We got to understand what that thing says and we need to make vows. We need to renew the deal we have with God and commit ourselves to doing what the covenant says. And so in Nehemiah 10, all the people get together inside the newly built walls of Jerusalem with the temple there in the background and they're like, all right, we're all going to agree to the following things. Not that many things that they agree to. Thing number one that they all agree to is we're going to be an exclusive people group. It feels so weird in terms of modern sensibilities, but this is a very unique situation in a very unique time with a people uniquely called by God and God broke the laws of time and space to be like, hey, I know this seems weird, but I'm the real actual God, then I can make nature bend to my will so you should do what I say. And they're all like, okay, we're going to do that in light of everything God has done and we are going to make a covenant with God or renew an existing covenant with God to say, we're not going to marry into neighboring tribes. We're going to be us. We're not going to adopt their gods and their social practices or their morality. We're going to do the morality and the social practices that God gave us to do. The second thing they all commit to is they say, we're going to do business weird. We're not going to do business on one day of the week and we're going to have integrity in how we do business. And then the third thing that they commit themselves to, and this is what we've been talking about for the last couple of days, and this is why you're getting a big long introduction. If you're new to this thing, I mean, it's just, it happens. It can't happen in a vacuum. I got to bring it up to speed. The third thing that they're all saying, we're totally going to do this as a people from now on us and our kids and their kids and their kids is that they promise that they're going to make a plan and a commitment to pay for the life of the temple, the religious life of the people, because that's going to be the centerpiece of who they are, their culture, their beliefs, their morality, everything is going to flow out of their relationship with God, which is going to flow out of this sacrificial system that's very ancient, even at the time we're looking at Nehemiah and they're going to dedicate themselves to that. But it ain't cheap. You got to have a whole bunch of people to make all of this stuff happen, to offer sacrifices and do the business of what now I guess we would call church. But back then, I guess what we'd call temple, then it takes very talented people to do this. They have to be well trained to know the material. It is a very bad thing to have a very poorly trained priest because inevitably they're just going to end up kind of making stuff up and then things go to chaos. So this is an expensive proposition. They've learned that it's an expensive proposition and in this last chunk of the covenant, which is the biggest chunk of the covenant they're making, they are creating a plan. For how they're going to keep all of this stuff funded there. Look at that. If you're brand new to this thing, one, welcome and two, you're totally up to speed on this season. That's it. There's a bunch of fun stuff that you missed. You can go back and catch that later if you want, or you can just jump in now and keep going with us when we're done with Nehemiah. The next season is going to be Galatians in the New Testament. That's coming right up. All right. So all the people, Nehemiah 10, 32, they say, we assume the responsibility for carrying out the commands to give a third of a shekel each year for the service of the house of our God, for the bread set out on the table, for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings, for the offerings on the Sabbaths, new moon festivals and appointed feasts for the holy offerings, for sin offerings to make atonement for Israel and for all the duties of the house of our God. Okay. So what's going on in this passage is not new. They are harkening back here to something God told them to do like 800 or 1000 years earlier, depending on who you talked to, depending on how you counted through the leadership of Moses in the book of Exodus. And all the way back in Exodus, which is way earlier in the Old Testament, tons of pages I'm turning here, the whole temple system with sacrifices and the priests and all of that, it's still coming into focus. And so this bit that I'm about to read you from Exodus 30, it's in the midst of all of this being explained for the first time to the people in Nehemiah's ancestors, distant ancestors from way back in the day. And this is where that temple tax idea got established in the first place. Exodus 30 verse 11, then the Lord said to Moses, when you take a census of the Israelites to count them, each one must pay the Lord a ransom for his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come upon them when you number them. Each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs 20 garas. This half shekel is an offering to the Lord. Silver was hard to come by in the ancient world. Silver, I guess it's still kind of hard to come by. It's held its value really well. Silver that is, this has been a medal that has been consistently worth a certain amount compared to basic necessities in the world at any given time. It's one of the real constants over all the things that have changed in human history. Silver is very, very steady. This coin in my hand, which maybe you can hear it, I'm tossing it, was minted by Alexander the Great. I like to keep this coin along with a coin minted by Xerxes right here next to me while I make the podcast because it's fun to be able to hold something that is from the era we're talking about flipping around in my fingers. And so this piece of silver here is a pretty big piece of ancient silver. This is almost half an ounce, half a modern day Troy ounce. But the amount of silver we're talking about here for this temple tax is much less than something that sounds like this when you drop it or like this on a hard surface. It is instead the equivalent of about six grams and 31.1 grams in a Troy ounce. So that is about a fifth of an ounce of silver that everybody was supposed to kick in to the coffers to put that in modern terms. An ounce of silver today costs, hang on a second. I'm searching it. It's $29 and change. Let's just round it up to 30 bucks for simplicity. We're talking about a fifth of an ounce. So that's what six bucks is about what people were kicking in every year per individual to cover the costs of the life of the temple. Bottom line is they're getting huge value for their six bucks a year contribution in the form of this temple tax. That's awesome. So now we're going to jump from Exodus 30 back to Nehemiah 10s. We're going forward to 800 or 1000 years again. And the people here still clearly have recollection of that rule set down back in Exodus 30. This temple tax had stood the test of time. But economically, it looks like people aren't quite in the same place that they were 800 or 1000 years earlier because the amount that they agree to commit to for the temple tax is one third of a shekel as opposed to one half of a shekel back in Exodus. Economies change. Things change. I'm not prepared to make any kind of estimation or judgment about their commitment level. They seem really committed to me. Seems like they're doing great. I mean, they're making a whole covenant. They don't have to make, I suppose. Then maybe part of the reason that they've reduced it from one half of a shekel to one third of a shekel is because earlier in the book of Nehemiah, there was some economic oppression going on from the upper class Jewish exiles who were trying to help build the wall in Jerusalem. And they were being hard on and exploiting the lower economic classes. And Nehemiah had to come along and crack some skulls and be like, don't do that anymore. And they agreed not to do that anymore. So maybe this reduced tax is a way to keep things working with the sacrificial system and all that's going on there, but also reduce the burden on the common people who just got done sacrificing so much to build these walls. Whatever the case, we know this tax is still in place. 470 ish years later at the time of Jesus because in Matthew 17, right after Jesus comes down from the Mount of Transfiguration and with three of his disciples and rejoins the rest of his disciples. I mean, this is wild. They have this amazing mountaintop experience where they see part of the glory of God. And they come down and the first thing they get greeted with is nagging about taxes because the religious leaders who are real mad at Jesus by Matthew 17, apparently it's time for them to collect this tax that was established in Exodus 30 and renewed in Nehemiah 10. And so Matthew 1724 goes like this, after Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two Drachma tax came to Peter and asked, doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax? Yes, he does. Peter replied when Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. So Peter kind of, you know, glocks away. I was like, I don't know what to do. I'm just going back to the house for Jesus's and ask. And Jesus asked, what do you think Simon? He asked from whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes from their own sons or from others? From others Peter answered, then the sons are exempt. Jesus said to him, but so that we may not offend them. Go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch, open its mouth, and you will find a four Drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours. So there's a pretty fascinating through line here with this covenant temple tax to support the life of the temple and all the people who make that thing happen. And also clearly at times it was too burdensome from normal people to handle. And also clearly at times it could be weaponized against people that the authorities didn't like as is the case in Matthew 17. But either way, what we're seeing here is a 1200 or maybe even 1400 plus year tradition that runs through the Bible that is renewed, right smack dab in the middle of the Bible here in Nehemiah chapter 10 and for better or for worse. This is how they privately funded without the use of tax money from the government. They basically made a private tax that everybody gave. I guess you could also call it a tie or a gift that everybody was obligated to give to make the life of the temple happen. Kind of interesting. Next time around, we'll look at the rest of the economic provisions that they make here in Nehemiah 10 with this renewing of the covenant and it won't be long. And then we're into Nehemiah 11 and it won't be long after that. And then we're into Galatians. All right, that was fun. If you're new here, thank you and welcome. And I hope your relationship with your mom is undamaged by the fact that she recommended this to you. And then you got a whole thing on ancient economics. But I think we've had a lovely time and I hope that you will give it a try again tomorrow. All right, it's plenty for now. I'm Matt. This is the 10 minute Bible Hour podcast.
