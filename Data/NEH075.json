And here in my right hand, I've got my Alexander the Great coin that I get out every single time that I'm going to reference or talk about Alexander the Great. I'm going to hear it listen to it. I'm going to drop it in my hand. It's silver. It's got some girth to it. I dropped it on my Bible right there. Is that sacrilege? Maybe I shouldn't do that. I don't know. Well, I mean, what happened has happened. And now you know scientifically, that's what it sounds like when you drop an Alexander the Great silver coin from whatever 340 BC onto a Bible printed 10 years ago. Pretty cool. Alexander casts a super long shadow. There's a reason you know his name, even if you never had a Western civilization class. I don't know if they teach those anymore or an ancient history class or even if you'd say, I'm not really a history person. You've heard of Alexander the Great because he changed the whole world. He wasn't even alive at the time of Nehemiah that we're looking at right now in the Bible together during the season of the podcast. He's born, I don't know, 80 years later in the mid 300s BC, we're looking at the mid 400s BC. And Alexander the Great is actually the guy who took down the Persian Empire that is in charge during the book of Nehemiah, the book of Ezra, the book of Esther, the book of Haggai, the book of Zachariah, all of that kind of stuff. So why am I bringing up Alexander the Great? Because yesterday we were talking about, we were speculating about how much clout Nehemiah had right now as we get into Nehemiah chapter five and see that he's able to just call people on the carpet and be like, stop doing all the things you're doing. Give back money. Give back land. What I say and they're like, yes, sir, we're so sorry, sir. Okay. Well, let's put it to an oath then if you mean it. Priests come over here, make all these nobles and powerful people take an oath in front of everybody to say that they won't do that anymore. That takes tremendous clout. How do you get that kind of clout? Well, more on that in just a minute. But first let's talk about how Alexander the Great a century later got enough clout to be remembered today. I think a big part of the answer is that he was loved by the people who followed him because he didn't ask them to do things that he wasn't willing to do himself. Famously, when Alexander the Great met his rival, Darius III, a distant descendant of Artaxerxes, the king during the book of Nehemiah, when Alexander the Great met Darius III on the battlefield, Darius is surrounded by that wicker armor wearing elite soldier unit called the Immortals and he's tucked way back in the line. What's Alexander the Great doing? He's wearing golden shining armor and he's in the very, very front with the equivalent of an ancient world neon sign with arrows pointing down and say, Alexander, attack me here and he leads all the most dangerous missions and he's the first one into battle. He's not asking anybody to do anything that he is not willing to do the most and the hardest first. And right from the beginning of Alexander's big gigantic campaign of conquest, it is obvious that he was beloved by the people who follow him because of that. I think if they all hate him, Alexander the Great's name does not resonate through history in the same way. Dude had clout and he earned it by putting his money where his mouth is by putting his own life on the line because really much like Nehemiah, he was a dude who believed that he knew the role he played in history, where he fits what the story was and he had lays her focus. He's a man on a mission. I happen to like Nehemiah's mission a lot better, but this is something that these two men from the ancient world born a century plus apart have in common. So why are people listening to Nehemiah? Why would they be willing to do all of this stuff and just bow their heads and agree to it? Is it because they're afraid of King Artaxerxes all the way back in Sousa? Remember when we're talking about Jerusalem to Sousa during this time, we're talking about the distance between like central Kansas and eastern Tennessee. It's not like Artaxerxes is just breathing down everybody's neck. He's a long ways away and we know that people are willing to flaunt the authority of Artaxerxes and oppose the things that he's ordered because in the very previous chapter, chapter four, Sanbalat and his ilk who are also subjects of the Persian Empire are more than happy to do things that fly in the face of Artaxerxes orders. No, I don't think these guys are effectively bending the knee to Nehemiah because of their respect for Artaxerxes. I think Artaxerxes tether on the affairs of people in Jerusalem was actually rather tenuous, rather frayed, rather weak. Huh, I think they are agreeing to these terms and they are shamed and humbled because exclusively of the clout of Nehemiah. Here's how the rest of this thing plays out. The rich Jews who were exploiting the poor Jews get called on the carpet by Nehemiah and he says, you got to give everything back. They don't even argue. We'll give it back. We'll not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say, paraphrase here is mine. We're super sorry, our bad. So then it says, then I, Nehemiah summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials taken oath to do what they had promised. Boom, right here, right now we're cementing that taken oath. I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, in this way, may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied at this. We're in a new material now at this, the whole assembly said, Amen and praise to the Lord and the people did as they had promised. Are you kidding me? I mean, it's one thing to say, Hey, our bad. I'm not going to argue with you. It's another thing to actually follow through. It's another thing to be effectively shamed and contrite in front of all the people you have power over by being forced to take this oath in front of them and by being forced to stand there with your hat in your hand while Nehemiah says this about you while shaking out his cloak. It's another thing yet for everybody, the whole assembly to be like, yeah, this is right. That's what needed to happen. The whole assembly said, Amen. And they praise the Lord for it. Why? Because it's a year at Jubilee, brother. It's not a scheduled one. It's not technically a year of Jubilee. It's a spontaneous one, but it's a very needed one. And so all of a sudden they all feel like you would feel if somebody just came and paid off your mortgage, this is such an understated verse right here that people are rejoicing and praising God because almost everything that is broken other than those walls, which we're making progress on is suddenly put back together. You did this? Well, Nehemiah is going to give credit to God, but ultimately Nehemiah did it. Why was he able to do it? Because he has moral credibility because he hasn't taken shortcuts. Why was Alexander able to tell his troops? We're going to do this risky thing. We're going to run this wild, wide out encircling flanking maneuver that may or may not work at the Battle of Isis or Galgomilla. Why were they willing to follow him in that? Because that's Alexander the great man. Have you seen his armor? Have you seen that he's going to lead the way? He's like going to sit in some command table in the back. Well, people fan him and feed him grapes and we fight. He's going to lead the risky maneuver. We will follow him. That's why he had the clout and the credibility to do it. Nehemiah has earned the clout and the credibility to do this by the way he is leading. Verse 14, moreover, from the 20th year of King Artaxerxes, when I, Nehemiah, was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah until his 32nd year, 12 years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. And we'll talk more about Nehemiah's timeline a little later on. It looks like he makes additional trips here. But during that time, when he is on duty, on task, on site, boots on the ground, he isn't eating the fancy food. He isn't squashing down the disgusting tomatoes like Denithor, steward of Gondor does with disgusting opulent disregard for what everyone else around him is going through. He won't live like that. He's one of the men. He's one of the people. Their fate shall be his fate. You know who loves that? Everyone who's following someone loves that. That's a man of the people. That's a man who understands the moment. That's a man who is laser focused on what the point is. The point is not his comfort. The point is be a thinker and a doer. See a problem, solve a problem. The point is make the problem of these walls his problem and take it from their art walls to now their art walls problem solved. And he knows that if he goes and lives in the lap of luxury and makes everybody else do it, he's not going to be able to achieve that thing. And he will miss his role in the grand scheme of the story and the grand scheme of history verse 15. But the earlier governors, those preceding me placed a heavy burden on the people and took 40 shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistance also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God, I didn't act like that. Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work. We did not acquire any land. I don't think he's bragging here. I think he knows that his credibility rests on this story. People are going to wonder, what's he out of town are doing? Oh, look, it's Nehemiah the Jew. I mean, not like a normal Jew like us. We have to gut it out in this burned out city that we've been trying to rebuild and scratch out a living. And you're the kind of Jew that dines at the table of the king and gets to drink his wine with him and gets to be privy to all the fancy decisions and sleep on a cushiony bed. You're that kind of Jew. Huh, Nehemiah can't be that guy and lead. He's got to be Alexander who might have the gold armor, but that gold armor is spattered in blood and mud. And he is in the throes of it. I think it's absolutely right for Nehemiah. And yes, I totally get it. I'm an unrepentant Nehemiah apologist. I think it's absolutely right for him to remind people, Hey, I'm not getting anything here. I'm not taking this. I'm not like, don't know, no, no, no, no, no, do not lump me in with these dirt bags who were governors before me and put a heavy burden on you and extracted your coin and your resources, your food, your beverage. I didn't do that quite on the contrary. I didn't even acquire land, even though it was there for the taking for me. And I was told that I could have it. Furthermore, verse 17, 150 Jews and officials ate at my table as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations. Each day one ox six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me and every 10 days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor because the demands were heavy on these people. So there's his governor's food. What's he going to do with it? Give it away to everybody else. And presumably they take it what's left and they give it away to people who are under their care. And as a result, instead of using this opportunity to enrich himself, he's giving it away and he's blessing everybody else with it. That's how you get people to follow you into battle. That's how you get people to listen to you when you every once in a great while have to play the authority card and be like, you're wrong, not because of how important I am, but you're wrong because it is wrong and you have to stop doing the thing because you're going to wreck this bigger project. We have going repent change your thing. He had the clout. He had the credibility to do it because of his focus, because of his clarity on where this all fits and the grand scheme of things and his clarity on his role and his clarity on what the task was to be achieved. And I love how he wraps up Nehemiah five. He lays all this stuff out about how he hasn't enriched himself. And the final line is this, remember me with favor. Oh my God, for all I have done for these people. Remember before when he declined to be the one to sort out the justice when people were being jerks to him and insulting him and said, vengeance is the Lord's. So also apparently in the mind of Nehemiah is credit. Credit is the Lord's to give or not give. I like this guy. I respect him. I'd follow him into battle. I'd put on armor and hold a spear while somebody else built the wall and then I'd give them the armor and I'd give them the spear and I'd take my turn building the wall. I would happily eat the leftovers from this table that he is so generously willing to share. This guy is going somewhere. He has a vision. He has a plan. We are dying for something like that in our world today. And when we see this kind of leadership, regardless of what era of human history we're talking about, the hearts of men and women are moved and action happens. Nehemiah is leading the right way and he's leading something special here. All right, I'm going to take me and my Alexander the Great coin. I'm going to shut it down for the day. I'm Matt.
