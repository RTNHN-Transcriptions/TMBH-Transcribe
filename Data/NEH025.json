It was a real short trip but I love the Spanish. I'm always working on Spanish. And so anytime I have the chance or an excuse to go somewhere where they speak Spanish, I want to do that. And as I feel like I always learn something. And so I was down there. I filmed some church stuff and got to visit a couple of real pretty places as well. One of those is a national park called Manuel Antonio. I bet some of you right now are like, Hey, I've been there. I know that place because it's famous and it's gorgeous on the Pacific coast. Then it's this little mountain that kind of sticks out into the water. It's full of wildlife. It's just lovely. And so I was driving there outside the park, just about dark. And I see a very obviously Jewish family pulled over on the side of the road. We're driving identical rental cars. So I thought that was pretty interesting too. So I pulled over. They're looking up in the trees. I just figured they saw something. Now I want to see what they saw and also I just wanted to talk to them because they look like interesting people. And sure enough, they had spotted a mommy sloth with a little baby slothlet. All curled up together is absolutely adorable. And they were delightful people and we chatted for a little bit and I wished them well and they wished me well and away I went fast forward a couple of days. I'm going to totally other part of the country slogging through some boiling hot terrain out there, sun exposure and who do I see far, far away, making their way toward me? It's a Jewish family again. That's crazy. And they're all dressed out in the Orthodox or maybe Hasidic. I don't know if I'm using the right words there, garb. And so I mean, I was hot, but they were. Cooking and we chatted again for a little bit and just delightful, wonderful people. Then then we say goodbye again because you're never going to see. I mean, you were just not going to run each other. This is crazy that it happened twice. Fast forward a whole bunch more time. We're driving around doing different stuff, totally different part of the country. Super remote way, way, way back there with this little private nature preserve that nobody goes to. It's down a terrible road and I get all the way out there. There's barely any parking anyway. There's like two spots total for the whole place. Who's in the other spot? I wouldn't be bringing it up if it weren't the Jewish family again. It's crazy. So we say hello. They were delighted to run into us again. What a coincidence. And we talked more, got to know each other more in the process of this. I see that the daughter gets out a little book and it looks like a Bible, but it's clearly in Hebrew. She's working it back to front, I guess, reading it right to left. I think I'm getting that right. And she's doing like a prayer or something. That was real interesting. And so I asked, you know, what's the book? What are you doing? And they were so polite. They explained to me that a long time ago there was a man named Ezra and he was a leader of their people. And he wrote down things that he did and he wrote down certain prayers. And this little book contains some of the prayers of Ezra. And the man said, my daughter here was just reciting some of the prayers that this man wrote hundreds and hundreds of years ago and have been handed down to us. And I thought that's the coolest thing ever. And I just let him mostly just tell me things about Ezra and Nehemiah. And I asked more questions and got the whole story or a big chunk of the story from a totally different perspective. It was just a blast. Maybe I'll tell you more about that stuff later on. And the reason I bring up this story is because one, so fun is human. You might get a kick out of it. Two, because hey, it's Ezra and Nehemiah stuff in the wild. It's so neat. And three, because that prayer that was in that book, that that girl in the jungle in Costa Rica was praying over the hood of her car facing toward Jerusalem. Is this prayer that we're coming up on here in Ezra chapter nine. It's a prayer of regret and remorse and confession and dependence of God and awareness of the grand history of God's working. With humankind and with his chosen people and all of it is prompted by the massive grief and concern that Ezra is feeling as he looks at the whole backstory of all of the covenant between God and the Jewish people. And as we realize, as he's really got his work cut out for him, if he is to lead the people into a rejuvenated resuscitated relationship with God and he's even willing to hold out hope that maybe if they can stop doing the stupid dance. Steps and maybe if they can remember which dance steps were the right dance steps, then maybe the presence of God in a physically obvious way would be among them again. So in Ezra nine three, he's just got the news about all the stuff that's going wrong and the detestable practices of the neighboring people groups being reintegrated through marriage into the Jewish people, the returning exiles. He's upset. And then he makes a very public display of it. When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness to the exiles and I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice. Then at the evening sacrifice, I rose from myself a basement with my tunic and cloak torn and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord, my God and prayed. And we'll get to the prayer thing here in a little bit. But this isn't the first time if you've been hanging out with me on this podcast or anything that we've heard about these public gestures of grief, of mourning, of humiliation, of anger. It's almost like a performance art, but not pretentious. It's a performance art that's justified. I remember in HBO's Rome, a series I don't recommend you watch. There was a form of this ancient world habit of public grief to bring attention to an injustice or an outrage that occurred when a mother was wronged by a rival mother in upper crust Roman culture. She just stood outside her window over Villa day and night saying, I demand justice. I demand justice that is stuck with me so vividly because it's such a powerful image of public grief to make a point. Ezekiel does this. Remember he roasted food over poop to make a point about how messed up things were. He also pulled out hair and beard and was required to do even more than that as a public expression of what was wrong as a prophetic message even to his people. And then how about Mordecai? When he heard about the plan that Haman and Xerxes had cooked up, he wore sackcloth and went around and made a very public show of this injustice and his grief over what had occurred. So Ezra, he's doing this. Everybody knows what it means. It seems a little foreign. It's maybe something that in upper Midwestern culture, we would regard as maybe a gesture of a little bit of self aggrandizement and maybe you're being a little bit dramatic. But we have other ways to get the word out now. We have other ways to make a point now. This was something that would have been understood by everybody as, hey, pay attention. Like the highest ranking priest here is behaving like this the moment he shows up. You should understand something is very, very wrong. And interestingly, it seems to work. People do respond and they gather around, not everybody, but everybody who trembles at the words of the God of Israel gathered around Ezra. Then they understood exactly why they were gathering because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And they just sit there and they're sad together in their grief. And that's it. That's how they pass the day. He's humiliated. This is self abasement. And at the end of the day, all right, it's time to get up, dust yourself off and lead. And he does so by humbling himself before God with this very potent prayer that is made it all the way down through the ages to people like me, Christians, to people like the folks I met out on the trail out and about around Costa Rica, Jewish people. And I suppose anybody else who would be interested in reading words like this sort of stood the test of time. And next time around, we're going to read through that prayer together and see what it's all about. And then we're down to the final chapter of Ezra. Man, that's the fastest we've ever zipped through any book ever. And I'm pretty proud of us, but also I'm not going to apologize for going fast because I want to get to Nehemiah. I'm kind of champing at the bit real soon. All right, I'm Matt is the 10 minute Bible hour podcast. Let's do this again soon.
