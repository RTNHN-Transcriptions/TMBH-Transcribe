I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast. I keep talking about the idea of this list of the phrases from the Book of Matthew that are the most famous beyond the boundaries of Christianity and beyond the boundaries of people who study the Bible and are into this stuff. Because there's a bunch of language in the Book of Matthew that has leaked out into the larger world. I think the passage we've been looking at for the last few days here, Matthew 19, specifically, verse 24, has got to be in the top 10, right? But you know the one I'm talking about, it's Jesus talking to his disciples after the rich young ruler he was talking to decides not to sell all of his stuff and give it to the poor and he walks away sad and then Jesus says, I tell you the truth, it's hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. This is the part I think is real famous right here. Again, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. We've discussed the contextual, obvious, clear meaning of this passage at great length over the last few days and yesterday we looked carefully at one of the alternative interpretations of this passage that what Jesus meant to say or what he actually said here was a thick, heavy rope and the word looks a little bit like the word for camel. And so maybe that's what he actually meant. But the bigger thing that you will hear people do with this passage with great frequency, this is an idea that is permeated Christian writing and Christian teaching for generations. And that is this interpretation that what Jesus meant here is that the eye of a needle does not refer to an actual needle that you could hold in your hand that has a teeny, tiny little opening, but that rather it refers to a long forgotten gate that we did not remember for a thousand years, but that everybody in the original audience would have known about. And so when you and I do this exercise where we go through the book of the Bible like Matthew and I'm like, all right, well, here's some historical data that might help us understand the passage. And when I say things like everybody in the original audience would have known this saying they would have known this phrase, they would have known who the emperor Augustus was, for example, I try to only say that when I'm sure I'm not exaggerating, but something like this ha does the idea of a hypothetical gate that maybe existed that we don't have any record of. Does it rise to that same level of saying with certainty, ah, the original audience would have taken it this way and they would have known exactly what he meant. They would have known the gate. They would have all walked through that gate at some point. I don't think so. So let me break down a little bit the way this thing works. The idea here with this eye of the needle gate interpretation is that there was some teeny, tiny little gate that to look at pictures of it as it's portrayed now, I don't see how you could ever get a camel or any beast of burden through there with stuff on it or otherwise. But the way the story goes is that there was this gate and it was really tiny so that a whole invading army couldn't cram in there at once. They'd have to go one at a time and then presumably the people on the inside of the wall could just stab them with a spear. You probably only have to stab like three or four of them. It would clog up the gate and it would be a big mess with bodies and stuff and they couldn't invade anymore because now the gate's full of dead people. But if you were there in peaceful times and you had like camel or something, that camel would have to hunch down real low on its little knobby knee elbow things and you have to take all of the camel saddle off and the bags and everything and then the camel could kind of wiggle through there real awkwardly, which I guess maybe you can train camels to do. I don't know a ton about how camels work. It seems kind of dumb because there are a lot of other gates that are bigger that would be more convenient. But that's the way the story goes. And my understanding is that the earliest, even hints of this that we see date back to maybe the late 1400s. So just a little bit before the Protestant Reformation yesterday as you and I were looking at the very mild linguistic controversy surrounding this passage and the use of the Greek word Camelon, we were able to look at this thing together and say, all right, well, how much does it actually change the meaning of the passage? If you're trying to cram a big, gigantic heavy rope like the one that you climbed up in gym class through a tiny eye of a needle or a whole big gigantic sweaty gross, knobby need camel through the eye of a needle. Either way, it's not getting through there. So the point pretty much holds. How much does it change the meaning? If Jesus is saying, like you'd have to cram a camel through a literal eye of a needle, like that you would sew with you would have to do that versus if Jesus meant, well, you would have to stoop down real, real low and get rid of a bunch of your stuff to get through this hole in the wall to get to the other side. I think it changes it quite a bit. Here Jesus is making a pretty exclusive comment, like, look, your world kingdom stuff. It just won't work. That currency is no currency in the kingdom kingdom. Whereas in this eye of the needle gate interpretation, yeah, there's still some of that idea of unburdening yourself, of having to get rid of all of those trappings and everything else. But then ultimately you're able to get down small enough to kind of weasel your way in there and get through. The metaphor does change a little bit from the emphasis being on the work of God just indiscriminately and without any qualification, making a new family of faith, not by any merit of the people he's making this family of faith out of. That would seem to be the meaning of we're talking about a camel going through a literal eye of a needle for sewing. But as the meaning of the camel going through some gate that maybe existed a long time ago and having done burden itself, that changes the meaning to you got to do some stuff. And once you've done that stuff, then you can get it done and get into that kingdom. I don't think those two metaphors are identical. So I do think there are some stakes here to whether or not there's actually some gate called the eye of the needle gate. Jesus then was drawing on that metaphor somehow to soften the teaching about the exclusivity of the kingdom and the uniqueness of him being the only way into it. So here's what we know. My research indicates that there was a gate that at least somewhat fit this description that existed in Damascus. If you're to walk it in a straight line, Damascus is maybe at 150, 175 miles from Jerusalem. And we know that this scene, according to the beginning of Matthew chapter 19, is taking place in the province of Judea. So at this point in the narrative, when Jesus is saying this stuff about camels and eyes of needles, we're probably just a little bit closer to Jerusalem than we are to Damascus, meaning that it wouldn't make a ton of sense for Jesus to draw on an analogy about a gate that may or may not have existed in a town that almost no one would have ever visited in the audience he was talking to. So it just doesn't make sense to me that that theory that he was referencing something that did exist in the audience would have known, but it was in Damascus. It just doesn't make any sense in Jerusalem. I'm sure there are some of you have been there right now and you're like, what? No, there is an eye of the needle gate. I have gone there. I've seen it. There's like some kind of Russian Orthodox church right there and you can walk right through it and take pictures. It's just I mean, I've been there. You're making things up. This is an actual gate. Well, that gate isn't on record as existing until long, long, long, long after the time of Jesus and the New Testament. And even then there's no indication that that little hole in the wall was actually the kind of gate we're talking about here at all. Tourism of that little hole in the wall picked up in the 19th century and it corresponds with the era that Mark Twain wrote about in his little piece called Innocence Abroad, where he described wide-eyed rubes being taken in by every holy site gimmick that anybody could make money on in the Holy Land. And this to me looks like that kind of a situation. The historical tradition associated with the thing that gets called the eye of the needle gate when you go to Jerusalem right now is anything but strong. So I guess what I'm saying is this. Yes, we have some little recent fragments of history that point to things that look like an eye of the needle gate or an eye of the needle door. What we don't have is any meaningful historical tradition. Nothing points to this in the distant past in any kind of way that would cause us to believe that Jesus meant anything more than hyperbole by this statement. A camel, it ain't going through the eye of the needle. It's just not going to work. It doesn't matter if it takes off its bags. It doesn't matter if it gets really, really humble and it's really, really sorry that it was a bad, bad camel. That ultimately isn't going to get it done. It would take a supernatural work to make that camel fit through that eye of the needle and only God has the keys to that kind of stuff. And so the blessing, the transformative blessing that it is to be made a part of the kingdom, this new family of faith is a gigantic deal that is beyond any human capacity. The humility thing is not then a work that earns you admission as the metaphor would express if we accept that the eye of the needle is a gate and that you can fit through it. If you are humble enough and do enough, rather it's an expression of the impossibility of world kingdom stuff and human effort making any individual perfect enough to earn their way into this new family of faith or into the kingdom. If anybody's in the new family of faith, they are there as one who is a beggar and who is needy and who is shown the grace and mercy of the king who never did anything wrong and has everything right. Here's my closing thought. I care about things like this and I get a little bit passionate about stuff like this because I don't like biblical studies that seem to be designed to cause you to reimagine the plain and obvious meaning of the text and that seem to be designed to point out how smart the person is who's talking. You are competent. You can handle this text. What you have in front of you with the Bible, whether you are a Christian or not a Christian, if you can interpret stories and ideas and other people's behavior, you're going to get the gist of the Bible. You can pick this thing up and figure it out. I'm glad that we get to do this together. Thank you for letting me help and work it through along with you. I do that as much for my own benefit as for anybody else's. I love doing this, but I don't ever want to give the impression that this is for people who went to school for it and have really dedicated their time and a lot of energy. No, you're smart. You're competent. You can think about these things. When I see some of these linguistic gimmicks or these historical context gimmicks, I just don't like that very much. What I want to do here is think about the raw materials of the text that are in plain sight in front of you and in front of me and acknowledge those places where maybe there's a little bit of controversy in order to cut through it to empower you to think about the thing and do with it what you need to. Thank you for indulging my little rant on the way out the door. I'm Matt. This is the 10 Minute Bible Hour Podcast.
